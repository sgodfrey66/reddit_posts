t2_3l4ha,"My fiancé and I just found out we’re having a baby! 
We had our wedding planed for November 6th and our honeymoon planned for November 8th, 
Baby is Due October 27th sooo we’re going to push the wedding sooner and have a baby/honeymoon! ;;;After a rocky few months in our relationship, the last few weeks with my SO have been so much better thanks to this subreddit. We’re finally talking instead of trying to figure out what’s wrong with the other. We haven’t fought recently, and we’ve even started having movie and date night again. Overall, our relationship is so much more stable then it was last year and for that I’m thankful! Thank you everyone here at r/relationships! ;;;I got into an ivy league school, grad school program, next to my husband's job's main office. Anyone in academia knows about the two body program, so this is a big win. I'm terrified of not doing well in the program, but with my husband by my side it will work out. It's nice to know I'm not alone in this. ;;;In January my father fired me from his company, explained to me how I am like a gangrenous limb and should be amputated. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have since landed a new job which I enjoy,  am very good at and within walking distance. My finances are in order, debt paid off and am making conscious decisions to increase my happiness. Like regular exercise and healthy cooking! :D

I have ceased communication with my father and step-mother. I no longer feel obligated to deal with the verbal abuse because 'family'. I have a fantastic relationship with my mum and am slowly forming a stronger bond with step dad who has always been a bit shy toward my brother and I. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am healthier, consistently happier, grateful and more productive then ever before! :D 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope everyone has a lovely day!! &lt;3;;;My boyfriend and I have decided he's going to move into my house in November, we're planning to buy another house next July and rent mine out (too small, we both have kiddos part time) and are talking about getting engaged somewhere inbetween.  :)  I've never had an easier, ""well this just works"" relationship, and I feel so lucky every day waking up knowing we're a team.;;;I hope everyone is having an awesome friday!! 

Nothing beats getting to spend the whole entire weekend wrapped in your lovers arms :) ;;;I feel really happy in my relationship and I really love my boyfriend. I was in an abusive relationship for a while when I was younger and it’s hard to come back from that but I feel so comfortable with my current boyfriend and I can truly see a future with him. We just went on our first trip away together and it was so much fun :);;;I'm graduating with my master's degree next month, my partner's graduating with their ph.d in August, and we're moving in together in June! ;;;My boyfriend and I went through a real rough patch at the end of last year and we ended up breaking up for a few weeks. We're back together now and actually communicating about things- it's incredible. I'm so happy being with him, I feel like I'm in the honeymoon phase all over again ♡;;;Re-connected with the hot guy I had a crush on in high school (it's now 10 years later). Found him on Tinder thousands of miles away from where we grew up.

We've meet dating for 2.5 great months and we're going to Yosemite this weekend! ;;;This was a couple months back, but my boyfriend and I had a cliche first kiss that I love telling- in the rain, sharing an umbrella, just before we went home.;;;Fiance (29F) and I (27F) have recently unlocked what feels like a new love-level. We were listening to a podcast together and it prompted a conversation about crushes being healthy and normal. It's brought us to a new level of closeness and trust where we can openly acknowledge crushes we have outside of our relationship. We have no interest in becoming an open relationship, but this type of conversation really takes the power and threat out of crushes, and instead makes them fun and invigorating. It's so awesome! I love her so much! (And it helps that both of us have crushes and not just one of us, lol). ;;;My fiance is the greatest. I got food poisoning a few days back, and he was just so sweet taking care of me. He went out early before work to get me some applesauce and gatorade, checked up on me all day while he was gone, and snuggled me hardcore when he got home. I gotta say, if I'm going to be sick, there's no one I'd rather have with me than him. ;;;I’ve been amazingly happy and insanely connected with my man. He’s my soulmate. I’ve never been more in tune and in love with a man in my life. It’s actually a little difficult typing that out because I’m a cynic and we all hate that gushy person, but it is love fest Friday! We’re planning a trip to the islands in a couple months, we play board games and cuddle all night. We have the best communication, there isn’t a topic that is taboo. We’ve had a few bumps, which we talk through and reconnect after. It’s so healthy I don’t know what I’m doing lol. ;;;After some rocky times in our relationship and not feeling we may make it in our long distance, I got to see him this last week and it has been refreshing and much needed. We talked a lot, spent time together, and the feeling is stronger and better. My anxiety and depression have really taken a toll on me, but this helped a lot. We are getting married in June and I feel so excited for the future now. I feel we are doing better, we are happier, and I can only hope that my mental health with also get better. I’m going to try and start seeing a therapist. I’m feeling more confident about a lot of things. I hope the feeling sticks around when I go back to school in a few days. ;;;I have a second date this weekend which I am overly excited about.

I also went drinking with housemates who are in relationship problem stages but don't want to be alone and it made me realise just how happy I am with myself :);;;My SO and I were having a rough time last week. He was depressed and I was struggling through a major work restructure that left me exhausted and cranky. I was rejected a few times initiating and he absent mindedly blew me off for a dinner date. We talked about it and this week he said he would seek the help of a therapist and surprised me by buying the newest book in my favorite series that just came out. Inside was a romantic note, and I immediately teared up reading it. The conversation also helped us connect on a deeper level so he was much more receptive to my advances. So happy with how things turned out. And as part of our restructure, I got a promotion today! It's been a whirlwind couple of weeks but it's all for the better ;;;
I had never been hit so hard with how much my wife loved me until I had a breakdown and told her about my suicidal thoughts. 

During that period whenever we were apart, while at work, or grocery store, or in the other room... Whenever she couldn't see me for an extended amount of time... She'd text me ""doing OK hun?"" ""are you OK?"" ""how are things?""

Always questions. Always caring. 30 of those messages a day for as long as it took me to strengthen up, she was sending them.  It forced me to respond. And i responded with honest, no's, yes, ok... Whatever it was.. But it made me respond and made me active. I couldnt dissapoint her. I don't deserve such love. I feel like anything I do is a failure at this point. 

More importantly if any of you feel suicidal like I have and want soemone to text, I will be your guy. Pm your number and I'll check in on you. I'll send you those texts. Just make a promise to me, that you'll respond. 

Strangers helping strangers makes the world a better place. ;;;I don't know if this will fit here but, there's this girl I like and even though she rejected me, I feel nothing but understanding for her. It's not the right time for her, and that's okay. I want her to be happy and, it is completely okay for me to be just friends. 

I've never had such a peaceful feeling before even though I got rejected, and this makes me happy I guess. Maybe I'm silly;;;My happy story is that I met this really sexy girl I dated 10 years ago again. After I surprised myself with the emotions I felt when seeing her, any contact after shortly died because I came on too strong. Fast forward two months I learned she uses jargon that certain kind of trend attracts a certain kind of person and now I hate her and the person she became and that makes me feel great.;;;",1553870204.0,b6y1o8,t3_b6y1o8,26,20,/r/relationships/comments/b6y1o8/its_love_fest_friday/,Time to share your happy stories with us. We really need to hear them. ,relationships,It's Love Fest Friday!
t2_2ifz6q88,"Ugh...why do you want to even be friends with someone like this?

The whole tire thing is weird, awkward and just....off putting for a 30 something to act like this.  Let alone her history of questionable morals.  Why is she even in your social circle?;;;She dates married men, tells you how hot she thinks your husband is, says she would bang your husband if she could, then told you that your husband cares more about her than your family. She doesnt sound like a friend at all. She sounds like a desperate insecure middle schooler stuck in an adult womans body. 

She doesnt want your boundaries and has made it clear she will step over them whenever she pleases. Your only choice is to cut contact, or limit contact to only seeing her and talking to her when your family invites her over. ;;;Maybe you can't completely cut her out but she definitely doesn't need to come over for movie nights. Just see her at family functions... those can't be that often can they? Stop hanging out with her outside of the required visits. It also sounds like you have nothing to really worry about since your husband seems just as annoyed with her as you are.;;;Ok, all the thirsty sh!t she's doing regarding your husband aside (which is obviously out of bounds): 

&gt;Then she’s sent me a nude and an explicit video of her

Whaaa? If a friend group (mixed or same sex or bisexual or asexual or *whatever *) does this, and people are cool with it...cool? But this is not a thing if it's not okay. This is EXACTLY the same as an unsolicited dick pic from a friend. What on earth?!? I have seen some of my friends naked (changing, whatever), but if one of my buds sent me an ""explicit video,"" I would feel...gross about it. 

Not to mention, her ""teehee, don't show your husband I totes want to f@ck"" = ""man, it would be so cool if he saw them!"" ;;;Shit, I'm worried Steve is about to get sexually assaulted by this loon. 

Look, we know that her name is Lola and she's a showgirl, but she is waiting in the wings for your next fight. That's how close it is. She can't help herself. You and Stevie boy need to cut this crazy out. ;;;I refuse to befriend someone who sleeps with people who are taken. It shows a lack of judgment and character. And if you think she won't do it to you, you are fooling yourself. Take her out of your close social circle. No more coming to your house at all. If you see her at a family party say hi and chit chat but keep it light. Don't create an enemy, create distance. ;;;I'm just going to be blunt. Lola is not your friend. She has set her sights on your husband. That's why she tried so so SO hard last night to get him to follow her home ALONE. 

And honestly this is not only disrespectful it puts your husband in a various precariuos position. What if he had followed her, she came on to him, he said no, and the next thing you know she's accusing your husband of making a move on her or worse?

Under no circumstances should you or Steve let Steve be alone with her. And frankly at this point if I were you I'd tell your husband to sit with you and both text Lola that her actions were alarming and crossed boundaries and perpahs it's better she spend some time apart until she cools off.

After that block and delete her.

This woman is not you or your husband's friend.;;;[deleted];;;Why didn’t you just say “no it’s not okay with me”?;;;Are you sure shes not in her teens? I find it hard to believe a woman in her 30's is that immature. Haha. 

Be firm and start distancing yourself from her. So what about the family ties. You don't need that stress in your life. ;;;People get crushes on their SO's friends and their friends' SOs. I mean what is a crush anyway but an attraction &amp; a commonality, right? It's not ideal but most people aren't going to act on it, and then the crush passes and it's fine. It's not even a speedbump in most relationships, it's like one step more relevant to the health of a relationship than which celebrities you have a free pass on.

What's not fine is how she's handling that crush. The appropriate thing to do is ignore it until it's passed. Instead, she's either intentionally trying to drive a wedge in between yall; or else she thinks that there's some possibility of a poly/swinger type situation. Those are the two options that best fit her including you (asking your permission, sending you nudes), as opposed to going behind your back. 

You've mentioned mental health, it's possible that she has delusions about the matter. Otherwise, it seems like she has poor impulse control outside the normal range.

&amp;#x200B;

Have you addressed this directly? Told her that her behavior is making you uncomfortable, that it's disruptive to your family? I think normally it goes without saying, but have you told her explicitly that you and Steve are monogamous with no maneuvering room?

&amp;#x200B;

You're not required to invite toxic people into your life, regardless of the fact that she's a family friend. You have a pretty easy line to draw: She's been attempting to interfere in your marriage and you're not going to attend, or bring your family to, events she's invited to for the foreseeable future. When your family objects: 'Regardless of her intent, she's been attempting to interfere in my marriage, which I have to prioritize. You're not the person who has to deal with this, I am, and this is the decision I'm making.'

You'll also need to bring Steve in line - whatever her intention is, it's passed the puppy-dog stage and is becoming an issue. This is the line for now and you expect him to follow it for the time being.;;;Outgrowing friendships happens, that's part of growing up. As for your mom trying to do another sit down, be direct and tell her you already did this and Lola explicitly said she would fuck Steve. And that you're done. You need to stand up for your boundaries and marriage. 

Also, you're not walking away from the friendship because you're skinny now, you're walking away from it because it's obviously detrimental to your well being. You don't her anything;;;*Oprah comes on stage*

“You get a red flag!

You get a red flag

Everybody gets red flaaaaaa-aaags!”;;;May I offer something to you.  First, this is not a good situation.  From your description it appears she wants something more from your husband and she is not going to respect your 'friendship' to get it.  But many people in the thread have pointed that out, so I will not repeat them. 

I am concerned by many of your responses to peoples comments.  The gist of what I am seeing in these comments is a high level of wanting to avoid taking action on this. Lola is actively trying to push  boundaries here and I sense reluctance on your part to put a stop to it.  You have said she is like another family member to your mother.  You seem reluctant to upset that.  You also have shown her that if she bugs you/pushes hard enough you will say 'go ahead'. For what ever reason, you are not pushing back hard enough.  And also you seem to say Well, I'll just let it slide and slowly reduce contact.  I worry that unless a line is drawn, Lola will continue to push ever further in this.  

Several people have commented that you should speak with your mother.  I concur.  Your mother should be in your corner in this.  

Have you spoken with your husband about how uncomfortable you are becoming with this?  He needs to know.  A good husband (which he seems to be) would honor this and go extra steps to eliminate the problem.  Maybe even not be around if she is present.  

Take them as you will, but these are my suggestions.

- Make cure you husband knows how uncomfortable you have become with this.
 - Make your mother/family aware of Lola's actions and your view of them.
 - Stop inviting her to situations where both you and your husband will be present. Or simply go Very low contact in general.
 - It is time to reevaluate your 'relationship' with her and your motivations for having one with her.
 - Do not accept the 'brother' excuse.  
 - Draw a line the in sand and do not let her cross it. 

This situation will only get worse and could end badly for you if you do not stand your ground now. 
;;;You could always get Steve to go off on her. Might be a little mean but it would definitely end it the quickest I believe, unless she has gone like full blown stalker and has a psychotic break of where if she can't have the object of her love no one can. So I guess I'd be careful because it sounds like something ain't right with her. As others have said I would keep it to strictly family functions only.;;;Stop inviting her over! She’s weird AF. ;;;We have a saying in Spanish, it’s called “Botala pa’l carajo” which means “throw her the eff out” which is what you should do. I’m surprised you kept your composure, it is admirable as hell. ;;;She’s either trying to piss you off or she does like him and has no shame. Start distancing yourself from her. I wouldn’t let a woman in my house that was disrespectful like that. If you see her at functions be cordial but you don’t have to put up with this crap. You can’t control her reaction but you can definitely have boundaries and not invite her over anymore. I’d rather have the awkwardness of gatherings then her trying to sleep with my husband and flirt in front of me all night ;;;I stopped reading at dating married men. It’s done. She is not your friend. Bye.;;;There comes a time in every friendship when someone needs to get told something they don't want to hear. And in Lola's case, you need to tell her, explicitly, to back the fuck off your husband, to in general, grow up, and to stop having fucking affairs with married men, because it's pathetic. Everything she's doing right now make you respect her less, and she needs to do some serious soul-searching. 

&amp;#x200B;

She may not want to be friends after that. She may not talk to you for a year. But either way, she needs to be told, and the only person who'd going to tell her - who knows whether she'll listen - is a real friend.

&amp;#x200B;

You can say it in a nicer way, and tell her that you're telling her this because you're her friend, but set some hard boundaries and feel free to be clear that you're judging her behavior as being shitty. Because it is.;;;Test her.. from his phone... you'll find out REAL QUICK.;;;You know that if he had agreed to follow her to make sure she got there safe, once she got him out of earshot she would have pulled the ""Oh I forgot, I need to stop at my place on the way to get something, okay Steve?  You can come inside while I look for whatever it is."";;;She wasn't looking for your permission to ask him to follow her, she was looking for your permission to try and shag him. ;;;You're being naive/blind to ask if you're reading into things. You have every right not to have her around.;;;Cut her out as much as you can, her attempts are outrageous and pathetic.

On the plus side, your husband is clearly completely disinterested. 

&gt; My husband, who is a comedian at heart, answered the nicest way, but I could tell he surprised/annoyed, “Follow you? Why?” When she tells him about her tire, he says, “Lola, your tire is fine. I’m really tired and you know that. I had a long day and still have homework.” Everyone in the room agreed that the tire is fine told her to calm down when she got a bit upset, “But don’t you want to see me home safe?” Steve: “Lisa needs my help. You’re fine.”

I have to admit, the above made me laugh. Seduction fail.;;;She is really being disrespectful towards you and your marriage. I feel like you should distance yourself from her &amp; definitely keep her away from your husband. ;;;That's not your friend. Don't have her back in your house, don't socialize with her. Not because your husband can't be trusted but because she's willing to hurt you and who needs that trash in their living room?;;;""Lola, due to your behaviour around my husband and blatant disrespect for pour relationship, I decided it's in best of our family's interests if we ceased our friendship. Bye."";;;If you were in my position reading this, how would you react?  If you aren't saying ""Wow this friend this lady has is really shitty and she needs to drop her like the plague, you'd be silly.;;;Oh she for sure has a crush on him. When i first read the title i thought, no biggie -- i've had crushes on my besties boyfriends but it's without question i wouldn't go there. But Lola.... her behaviour is worrisome and track record is downright despicable (in my biased opinion). Best of luck, OP! ;;;&gt;then add the comments like, “Yeah, Steve’s hot. I’d do him.” 

And you didn't tell her off and throw her out right there? I would have. I wouldn't stay friends with this person. Nope.

Then it just gets worse, and grosser, and even cringeworthy. Lose this b.;;;Come on, why is this person your friend?;;;Girl. You know EXACTLY what to do. Frankly you let the back and forth about will he or won’t be take her home go on far too long. Tell that girl to beat it. And stop hanging with her so much before you’re making an altogether different type of post. Your intuition is SCREAMING at you. Hope you’re listening. ;;;&gt;And her track record for dating married men is...


This is a big reason why I steer clear of friends who have shitty morals/ethics. Someone who is willing to be a party to affairs isn't a trustworthy friend.  I think people try to excuse it by saying, ""Well they've always been honest with ME."" but the truth is they juts haven't yet had sufficient opportunity to lie/betray to you. ;;;I mean, she sleeps with married men. *Plural.* And she's blatantly flirting with your husband.

But even if she didn't have a crush on him and she was acting this way for shits and giggles, it doesn't matter. She's crossing boundaries and making both of you uncomfortable. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say she's aware she's doing it, too, considering it sounds like you both expressed pretty blatant frustration. Which also means she does not respect you. That alone is enough to reconsider and end the friendship.;;;You have a man with a backbone it seems. You're well off. There are many men, married and single who would have followed her home. The whole damsel in distress act is something your husband sees through. The two of you together can set boundaries and she'll have to go find another couple to bother eventually. ;;;Well honestly she's a shitty friend, and obviously has some issues but it's your husband that need to shut this down, he needs to be clear that he's uncomfortable even if he's not, but he knows how uncomfortable you are. It'll either send her packing or smarten her up. Never be afraid to cut people out of your life that are toxic to your well being, I cut out my brother and his girlfriend because of how toxic they were to my life, I'm still grieving the loss of the relationship but I'm also feeling so much lighter and happier.;;;She's not your friend. She only hangs out with you to be closer to your husband. ;;;If you don't want to cut contact with her I'd get really blunt.  Any time she says something inappropriate I'd tell her ""That's very inappropriate, stop it.""  If she asks if she has your permission for something, just say no, and suggest she asks someone else.  Also, by all means don't invite her over anymore, and be ""busy"" more often if she wants to hang.   You don't have to explain this to her or anyone else if it would cause bad feelings, basically just ""ghost"" her except when you have to see her and then be polite but don't tolerate boundary pushing. 
;;;Soooo she explicitly said she’d bang him, flirts relentlessly with him in front of you, shamelessly tries to get him away from the group so it’s just the two of them AND has a history of sleeping with married men? 

Honestly do you really need reddit to figure this one out? She sounds like a terrible person and I would have cut her off long ago without a second thought if I was in your position. ;;;Why did she send you a nude and explicit video of herself? Who the hell sends that stuff to their friends?! ;;;This friendship is over. She has zero respect for you, your husband, or your marriage. You need to cut her out, she sounds like she has some severe issues and you do not need that toxicity in your life. Your husband sounds like an angel, good on him for shutting her down. She is selfish, wants to fuck your husband, and doesn’t care about you or your feelings. Get rid of her ASAP.;;;Cut! her! off! 

Ghost. She's trouble. Don't let her back in your house.;;;Lola sounds like a winning combination of drama queen and idiot. Slow fade her, and if she asks why you stopped inviting her to do anything or reaching out to her, tell her that it's because she's high maintenance and creepy towards your husband.;;;Yeah, cut her off. It doesn't matter if she's considered daugther of your family, they will take your side in the end. ;;;She sounds like she gets her self esteem and self worth from ""being more attractive than the woman a man is committed to"". She probably ""needs"" this for her self worth. And she probably needs the drama. If there is drama because of her then in her logic that means that she is important etc. 

My guess is that just not getting her any kind of emotional reaction is the best way to go. If neither you nor your husband will let yourself be emotionally pulled into her drama (check out the grey rock technique), she will soon get bored find someone else to do this to. 

I could totally understand if she riles you up, she is trying to do exactly that. Your home is your home and it's for you to decide who is allowed in. You don't need to justify or have a ""good enough"" reason. It's ok to not want her in your house.;;;Why do you want to be friends with someone who dates married men anyway? This shouldn't be surprising behavior coming from her at any rate: she's obviously targeting there men for the thrill of it, and now she's upping the anti for an even bigger thrill by going after her ""friend's"" husband. I put that in parenthesis because she clearly isn't your friend, and shouldn't be.;;;Yeah this exact scenario happened to me with a girl I was friends with back in MIDDLE SCHOOL. 
Get rid of this crazy woman!!;;;Use the voice recorder app catch her out saying weird stuff boom proof ..
Then you can show your husband and family .
I think they feel it's too crazy to be true .

I record my son's dad as he's a serial liar 
While not court evidence it's proof of the shitty person in the court of friendship .;;;OP please keep us updated. I’m hoping you’ll cut the toxicity out of your life. She’s delusional! 

Not only does she like what she can’t have, but she sounds like she enjoys the drama around it. The whole “he cares about meEeEe” comment. I’m guessing none of the married men left their wives for her or ended up staying with her, am I right?;;;Lola doesn't care about you.
That's enough to end the relationship.;;;I'm just going to echo what everyone else is saying here. Cut her out. If you have to see her, make superficial convo. Do not tell her anything personal. Do not hang out one on one anymore. 

If she asks why, tell her that she has refused to respect your boundaries and you don't have room in your life for someone like that. 

Then leave it at that. Don't justify, argue, defend or explain your decision. 

And tell your mom to butt out. You're in your 30's, you're not children anymore. She doesn't need to police your friendships. ;;;Hmm. I have to say, if you're coming to this sub asking if you should break up with someone or cut contact you will only get encouraged. So if you *want* to cut contact, this is the place to come for affirmation, not so much fair leveled opinions.

She is a long long friend, with a deep relationship going to your family members... it's hard to say just cut contact without laying it out in front of her.

3 options before you do cut contact, if you do, if I were you...

1. Get husband to flatly put her down, say stop trying it, you don't turn me on, can't turn me on, its getting embarrassing now.. im with (you).

2. You tell her straight up, in a cival way, that if she carries on she won't be seeing any of your family, at all.

3. Get primal on her ass and lay the law down. ""I feel like you are pushing boundaries with my husband. Back. The. Off. I don't care if you don't think you are. I do. My husband. And so help me god you carry on then...""

I can't help but think your husband has properly laid down the law either though...;;;You need to discuss with your husband.. she Amy tell things differently to him and drive a wedge between you two.. both of you need to be in sync and then it’s easier to shut her down.. ;;;Cut contact asap.. Your family comes first and she definitely doesn't care about that;;;not that you need more confirmation, but she's 100% out of line.  She is not a friend.  

eta:  and I think it's great your husband wasn't falling for her BS. ;;;She’s stomping all over your boundaries and clearly wants to get in your husband’s pants. 

Drop the rope, you don’t need to be friends with her anymore.

Distance yourself. Let her calls go to voicemail and don’t reply to any texts or take an entire day to reply “oops must of missed this text, we’re been so busy...”.

Let her drift away into *someone we used to know* land. ;;;You know you need to get rid of her. Pretty soon she's going to ""accidentally"" start sending your husband nudes and videos.;;;OP, cut off all ties with that homewrecking attention whore. I had a friend like that at one time. Anything I stuck my dick in, he had to have it and did everything he could to cause wedge anyone I was serious with. He succeeded. 3 times. I found out the hard way. You do not want people like that in your life. She's even gloating about it. The fact you have to ask a group of strangers the obvious is suspect but in case it's not, don't be foolish and keep scum like that in your life. ;;;I am pretty bothered by the fact she justifies dating married men whose ""relationships aren't doing very well."" Call me conservative/old fashioned/whatever but marriages have their ups and downs and that's between the husband and wife. That does not give a green light to outsiders to justify ""well they are fighting or arguing so here I come to make things more difficult!"" 

She doesn't sound like a respectful person or a good friend at this point. I'm sorry that she's not. It sucks because y'all have known each other since you were teens and I'm sure she means a lot to you but she's crossed the lines.;;;Screw her, she’s a home wrecker and given an opportunity will try and hook up with your husband. She’s not your friend, cut ties with her and screw what anyone else says.;;;This is a woman that does mushrooms with you, and expects your husband to treat her like a GF? Come on OP. Grow some stones and break off your friendship with her. ;;;Classic attention whore. Cut that chick off till she grows up. ;;;I feel like you should speak with your family and let them know what's going on, so that she isn't invited to these functions anymore.

My friends and family would respect my concerns about someone trying to sabotage my marriage, regardless of this saboteur's standing in our lives together, and I'd hope yours would too. I'd go this route first, maybe gaining specific allies within the group first so that the others are more likely to come around to your side.

Your friend would ruin your marriage to catch some dick. Think about that before you start to worry about how it would damage her reputation or standing in your circles.;;;I’m not usually so explicit in my comments but why are you so dense about this issue? This is your husband and your friend is being really inappropriate but you are asking if there’s something wrong? Come on.;;;This woman and so cakes friend is trying her damn best to manipulate a situation with your husband. She’s dangerous, as in sociopathic. Meaning she’s already made inappropriate comments about him over and over again to test how you’ll react. Kick her to the curb. If you’re here asking this question then go with your gut.   ;;;This woman sounds like she can justify anything in her mind.

I'm guessing she would have taken your approval as also magically coming with a wink and a smile that really means she's free to see if he wants to screw her. And if he does, it's all okay!!!

Except not.

Drop her like a wet turd.;;;Yes she likes your husband but I don't think your husband will cheat on you with her. From the looks of your post he's not interested in her one bit.  Probably because he loves you! ;;;;;;",1553877301.0,b6zgsc,t3_b6zgsc,355,69,/r/relationships/comments/b6zgsc/i_32f_think_that_my_friend_30f_has_a_crush_on_my/,"I have a friend, let’s called her Lola. We’ve been best friends since we were 16 and are now both into our 30’s. This past year, she’s been exhibiting behaviour that is causing me to rethink the friendship.

So to skip all the fluff, last night three of my friends came over to celebrate my birthday. We watched a movie on the couch because I was recently in a car accident and am on bed rest. While my husband, Steve, and my other two friends were in the smoking room, Lola comes up to me in the living room and says, “Hey, do I have your permission to ask Steve to follow me to “friend’s” house in his car?”

Me: “You don’t need my permission to ask him but I already know the answer and he’ll say no. He’s really tired. So just leave him be. Why do you want him to follow you, your tire will make it.”

Lola: “Yeah but are you ok with me asking?”

Continuous back and forth about me asking “why?” and her saying “are you ok with it?”

Me, getting frustrated: ”Lola, your tire is fine. You’ll make it. Besides, he’ll say no. He just spent all day at school, went to the gym, then he took care of the kids and still has to put them to bed and then do his homework. He’s really tired and he’s going to say no.”

Lola: “I know all that but still. Are you ok with it?”

Me: “Ok with what?!”

Lola: “Me asking Steve to follow me.”

Me, frustrated: “Why do you need my permission?!”

Lola: “To see if you’re ok with it.”

Me, very frustrated at this point,: “I don’t care if you ask him but he’s going to say no! He’s tired and would rather be at home with his family. And I don’t know why you’re asking because even though I’m telling you that he will say no and why he’ll say no, but let me guess, you’re going to go in that room and ask anyway. Right? Lola, why would he want to leave his family to take you home?”

Lola: “Because he cares about me and wants to make sure I get there safely.”

Me: “I think he would rather be home helping his injured wife on her birthday than following you “friend’s” place. You know what, Lola... Whatever! Go ask him but he’s going to say no. Why even bother asking?!”

Lola, biggest smile on her face: “He won’t! He cares about me.”

She goes straight into the room and in front of everyone goes, “Steeeeeevvvee would you follow me in your car?”

My husband, who is a comedian at heart, answered the nicest way, but I could tell he surprised/annoyed, “Follow you? Why?” When she tells him about her tire, he says, “Lola, your tire is fine. I’m really tired and you know that. I had a long day and still have homework.” Everyone in the room agreed that the tire is fine told her to calm down when she got a bit upset, “But don’t you want to see me home safe?” Steve: “Lisa needs my help. You’re fine.”

She left. Was gone for two hours then came back and stayed quiet until Steve came down around 10pm to finish the movie with us. That’s when she perked up and started talking again.

That was last night and I would have brushed it off but then add the comments like, “Yeah, Steve’s hot. I’d do him.” Always asking if her clothes are appropriate to wear in front of him... but then goes and wears the lowest cut top ever. When she came over and did mushrooms, she only wanted him to help her and when he was gone because he was sick of her hanging off him, kept asking where he was and when he was coming back. Then she’s sent me a nude and an explicit video of her and said, “Don’t show Steve!” Like, why the hell would I show him in the first place?! 

And her track record for dating married men is... well, it has me worried as she says it’s ok if the relationship isn’t doing well... anyway, I had a conversation with her just this week about the things she says regarding Steve makes me uncomfortable. Then this happened last night. She’s a family friend and considered another daughter to my family... so I don’t know what to do.

Am I reading into things? Lola says I am. Steve says that she is just weird but has no boundaries. But I think she likes him... and I want to cut contact but can’t due to seeing her at family functions. Can’t talk to our friend group. Can’t really talk to my parents because they don’t think she likes him but they agree she has issues and needs therapy. 

Ugh... I just don’t know what to do.

TD;LR: best friend went and asked my husband, after I told her not to, to follow her in her car to another city during my birthday party. He said no. She was a bit upset. She’s also made comments about how he’s so hot she’d do him. Am I overreacting by thinking she has a crush and it’s too far... therefore not inviting her to visit again because it makes me uncomfortable when she’s around him? Already talked to her before birthday incident happened and she thinks I am because “he’s my brother!” ",relationships,I (32F) think that my friend (30F) has a crush on my husband (32F) despite her telling me she doesn’t.

t2_37ml46ds,"I’m sorry this happened to you. Him using your money to betray you is beyond the pale. ;;;&gt;He also went overdrawn because of this and had the audacity to ask me for money. **I essentially paid** for him to cheat on me.

Wait... you gave him the money?!?! Why on earth would you do that?;;;He looks like an addict;;;OP, it sounds like your BF has some sort of addiction issues.  And OP, please, this isn't something you need to support him through.  Just because he's addicted doesn't mean he hasn't cheated.

Dump him.  And tell him that he pays that money back.  Be prepared that you might not get it back though because guys like that? They'll do absolutely anything and everything they can get away with.;;;Let's imagine you stay with him... What will your life look like in a few years, if you're with someone who does not respect you, can't hold onto a penny, and has been taught that you will actively support him if he does things that hurt you?;;;You're being emotionally and financially abused and this is not a good person.;;;Ex cam girl here, please leave him. Most the men on those sites are deplorable. I was often told how much prettier I am than their wives, which is why I had to stop camming. I know it can be hard to leave a toxic relationship, but do you girl. Get a hobby to focus on this energy on and leave this guy! Good luck girlie.;;;I really don’t think he counts as a good person if he’s doing stuff like this. He knows you don’t like it, that you consider it cheating, and there’s no way he doesn’t know it’s unfair and horrible of him to ask you to pay for it. 

You seem to think that he doesn’t realize how horrible he’s being, but I’d argue he does realize, he just doesn’t care. He’s not ready for a real relationship because he doesn’t care at all about your feelings on the matter. He seems to only want virtual/online connections, and that’s fine for him, but you should get the hell out of this mess. This is not a harmless thing he’s doing that doesn’t affect you, it’s actively hurting you emotionally and now he wants it to hurt you financially. 

He’s really not worth your time or effort. Whatever good you feel you’re getting out of the relationship can’t possibly outweigh the bad at this point. ;;;Run! This is not any different than any other addiction, and you’re enabling him by paying for it. ;;;Why on earth are you still floating the idea of staying with him? Get some self respect. ;;;You're becoming his mom....;;;It sounds like he’s got an addiction. I think it’s best you suggest he gets some help, but for you I think it’s a good idea to leave him. You aren’t a cash point and you can do better. ;;;It might be time to take a break from him. If he would rather be having “relationships” with cam girls than with you, his gf of 5 years, that is pretty telling of how he views you. 

Sorry, I hope you can work it out but ultimately it might be better if you can’t. Good luck. ;;;Lol why would you even stay with him?;;;Sounds like you are dealing with an addict. You're going to have to decide whether or not you are willing to work through something like this- especially considering he is overdrawing his account and manipulating you/lying to you for money to cover his mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you really want to help keep him financially stable through an addiction that involves cheating on you? If you can, and he is genuinely trying to get better then bless your heart. I've had to deal with a lot of financial bs from my SO, so I can't talk too much shit but his was a disability and bad adult decisions on my end.

&amp;#x200B;

Addiction is something I wouldn't be able to emotionally handle, let alone a sex addiction. I would separate finances and make sure you have money to take care of your bills and let him face the repercussions of his actions.;;;It’s a shame, he’s an addict. This is just like drugs or alcohol, he could really still love you, still be a nice guy, but he’s addicted big time, and it’s going to take a long while to fix. 

It hurts but your best move is to leave him I think, this is something that only he can fix.

And cut off all his access to your money lol;;;Okay, so I'm poly, &amp; I personally wouldn't mind if my fiance wanted to see a cam girl, but if he blew so much money on it that he *overdrew his account* and needed me to bail him out, I'd be furious. Plus, he told you he'd stop, and *obviously* hasn't. He broke his word and is really financially irresponsible.;;;I’m sorry :( but I need to say this. Good people can do bad things. 

He may treat you good or be nice in other ways but the good memories aren’t going to fix his behavior and you’ll eventually start to resent him. Maybe separate until his therapy starts... I just don’t see this going well without you both getting hurt somehow unless something drastic occurs ;;;I’ve been where you are. I was with my ex for three years, we lived together and all the works. I paid every bill, while he told me he couldn’t afford most of his own bills because of his camgirl addiction. It never ended, despite him telling me many many MANY times that he could never hurt me by cheating again. I broke up with him, because there was no way he was going to change. Being single feels much better than being both unwanted and disgusted by my partner. He’s a fuckin’ loser, especially if he’s asking you to cover his nasty addiction. No remorse or consideration for you. Drop him.;;;That's really shitty. I'm sorry you're going through this, it definitely hurts;;;Should’ve left him with the overdrawn fees. 

Gosh, I’m sorry you had to go through that. You deserve better. 

Just wondering, has an addiction been ruled out at all? It’s unlikely and I wouldn’t ask him (last thing you want is to give him ideas for an excuse). But sometimes people do genuinely have issues like that. I only ask because he overdrew his account... that doesn’t seem normal?;;;I was addicted at one point. All I can say is I just wanted to feel connected to my partner more but it scared me we weren't clicking together anymore. Getting high with your partner (or even incense and aphrodisiacs) while pumping nice music is a good way to get back sex drive. Sex is really boring and stressful if you think about it too much. The best sex I've had was with the person I loved most, the most stressful sex I've ever had was also with this person. 
Couples counseling would be great if you're open to it. Sex should be something fun that also makes you feel great in the end. If someone in the relationship wants to skip steps then there's definitely a disconnect. Thank you for paying the bill this time. I hope things improve for you.;;;",1553890926.0,b7273a,t3_b7273a,36,22,/r/relationships/comments/b7273a/update_bf_31m_still_using_webcam_girls_despite/,"UPDATE from previous post, original link here:

Short version of previous post - bf doesn’t want sex with me due to ‘anxiety’ but frequently visits webcam girls .

TLDR at the end.

After bf had registered for sessions with a sex psychotherapist, and him making an effort it seemed that things were getting better.

Yesterday I found out that he spent over £100 on cam girls in the last week.
He saw how distraught I was after the last time and we nearly broke up, but he just can’t seem to stop.
He also went overdrawn because of this and had the audacity to ask me for money. I essentially paid for him to cheat on me.

I don’t think that we can get back from this.

TLDR: bf promises that he won’t use webcam girls again. He does and asked me for money because he couldn’t pay for it without telling me what it was for.",relationships,UPDATE: bf (31m) still using webcam girls despite promising not to. Asks me (31f) for money because he couldn’t pay for it
t2_x2o6w,"You need to talk to her and let her know that her actions have consequences that affect other people, but if I were in your situation, I would take a very different approach from the one you are thinking of.  

If you send her that message, and come right out of the gate swinging with ""why do you always lie and over-exaggerate stuff? like all the time"", you will be giving her an opportunity to deflect the conversation into irrelevancies.  She'll argue over the meaning of ""all the time"".  She'll argue over ""always"".  She'll miss the *point* of the whole thing.

If it were me, I would say it like this (and I would do it in *person*, not over text, because text is not a good medium for important and emotionally-charged communications):

""[Sister], when you lie to me about things, it makes me feel as if I cannot trust you and that I do not want to be open with you about things that are important to me.  I value our relationship, but in order for it to be the close one we have had, I need to be able to trust that when you tell me things, they are true, and I need to know why you chose to lie to me about [the things she lied about].  Can you do that for me?""

If you take that approach, there's nothing for her to argue *with*, because you are not making statements about absolute truths, you are making statements about how you *feel* and what you *need*.;;;If your sister was abused, I'm not sure the people you went and checked her story with would actually know the truth...  I'm lucky to have never been in that situation personally, but I gotta say if I was I would have a much easier time confiding in someone like you vs. my grandmother. The cheating thing would be a little easier to verify with other people I suppose, but I still wouldn't assume that your grandmother would know all the details or not have reason to lie to protect her own kid's infidelities. 

To put that aside for a moment and assume she's definitely lying about those specific things that you've verified with other people -  your message sounds harsh and I don't think you should say it like this. I think you should talk about it in the specifics rather the broad. IE no 'you always lie' language. I would start with the cheating thing. Talk about what you heard from your grandmother. Ask her to really think about the evidence she has about her parent cheating. 

W/ the cheating, you don't seem to know if she's 'lying' in the sense that she knows it never happened and is just trying to mess with people VS. she really feels &amp; believes it happened despite hearing evidence to the contrary. There's a big difference there, especially when you're dealing with a 15 year old who may have hazy memories of the past and how things went down when her parents we're divorcing. ;;;Regarding the 15-year-old, be very cautious about accusing someone of lying about sexual abuse. Tread carefully.

Regarding the 13-year-old, that's totally normal, cherish it. That's about the age I started hero-worshiping my older brother (6 year gap) and we hung out all the time, it was great. Crashed and burned hard when I realize he had faults too, at the height of my angsty-edgy late adolescence . . .;;;I feel like this compulsive lying could be the sign of some serious mental health issues. Like, maybe whatever trauma she has experienced has caused the lying behavior.

I'm just not sure it's your place to call her out on this, or if it would or even could help. You might want to tell your parents about your concerns with her lying, she might need some real help.;;;chronic lying is a common symptom of abuse actually. I would take what she's saying seriously. ;;;I would like to make one thing very clear - you do not *know* if she's lying or not. And when it comes to sexual abuse, that's not something you should be careless about. 

&gt;After i got back, i talked to my grandma about her parents cheating and sx abuse when we were younger to see if it was true, and nope.

No reason they would know. And even if they knew, they probably wouldn't tell you.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not ruling out that a 15 year old is lying, that happens all the time. But tread very fucking carefully here. ;;;As others have said in this thread chronic lying can be a symptom of sexual abuse, doesn't necessarily mean it's true, but also other people you ask might 1. Not know / assume it's false or 2. might be covering for themselves or others. There's probably no real way to know for certain but be careful and gentle on this matter specifically. Best of luck;;;Hey there. I lied a lot as a teenager, and into my twenties. It had everything to do with my self-esteem and self-worth. I felt like no one really liked me and no one ever would unless I made myself seem worth it somehow.

I don't know if thats what your sister is doing, but it might be. If you can find ways to be encouraging and support of some of the other things she does it might help quite a lot.;;;I actually think you come across really unfeeling in all of this. All 3 of you are just kids, and kids lie, and lie often. Especially to accuse her of potentially lying about abuse, and outing her to your grandma when you have no proof, is really reprehensible. I'm an adult women almost a decade your senior and I still exaggerate all the time, I always have, but it's just a joke among my friends and I myself admit I do it, and in time, she will too. She's probably extremely insecure, and DID have a rough childhood that led her to this. You need to ease up, dude. It's not that serious.;;;I was sexually abused and everyone knew it but when asked...everyone denied it. Yes, it could be an attention seeking lie, but it could very well be the truth.

If a child is lying about being sexually abused, it could be just attention seeking without any real comprehension about consequences or her telling a friends story as her own. 15 seems too old to be out n out lying, if she is in a healthy home. 

Before you throw out the baby with the bathwater, think back to your own life. Have you ever lued about anything? Does that mean everything you have ever sais is also a lie?

Also, not knowing the exact specifics of the lie, it could be more of a difference of perception, rather than a lie. 

My son ""lies"" about certain things from his past, but upon closer examination, it is more a different perspective that exculdes certain facts he either does not remember or wasn't privy to.

I would suggest either calling the proper authorities to report her claim, talk to her about reporting her claim and let her know that you are here for her no matter what. Sexual abuse isn't something that has to happen to all children in the same household nor is it something people would be aware of or willing to admit they knew.

My grandparents denied knowledge of my father, their son's crimes. They testified in court as such. They accused me of being a spoiled resentful child who just lies about everything.  It wasn't until a few decades later when my grandmother was in a care facility with Alzheimer's, that I got confirmation that they knew and chose to lie. She knew I was her grandaughter, but forgot who my father was. She told me about how she was sad that she outlived a few of her children (of 9 children in all). She told me how she protected her son and how that harlet child of his seduced him and she was of the devil sent to damn her son. Her husband was a pastor and i presume the idea they raised a son or two that did such things she could not admit. Her other son died in prison for similar crimes, hence why she lied to keep the other out of the prison system that stole her other son.

I am saying that before accusing her of lying you better be 100% certain, and you can't be. The damage my family's lies did to me nearly equal that of the actual crimes my father committed. I learned to trust no one and that i am truly alone. ;;;You accuse her and she’s going to defend, deny and double down. 


Instead you need to focus on expressing the central reason of why lying, even if it seems harmless destroys a relationship. 


“When you lie it undermines the trust between us. That trust is a huge part of what binds us together. Lies eat away at those bonds. Part of the wonderful thing about loving supportive relationships is feeling safe. A result of you lying means I always have to be watchful and onguard, I can’t relax, I can’t take what you’re saying at face value, I always have to verify it. So instead of feeling safe I feel I have to be on constant guard to catch the lies. It creates a lot of negative feelings. All of this pushes me away and makes it very challenging to have the closer brother/sister relationship I wish we could have. When I’m lied to I feel manipulated, sad, disrespected and angry. In order for us to be closer, I need you to stop lying to me.”


This changes it from being about her to being about how her actions impact you. It describes the negative impact her behavior has on you, the consequence of the behavior and what you need from her going forward. It makes it about the larger issue and not one particular incident.;;;When I was a teenager, I would lie about things. Stupid things, like kissing a guy when I hadn't, going places, owning things, exaggerating my abilities, all sorts of stuff. One day I got called out on it by my entire social circle. I lost a lot of friends and a lot of respect, and it was an awful time. It *absolutely* needed to happen. I learned a lot from being called out, and stopped lying and started to address the reasons for why I was lying.

Looking back I know that it came from a place of insecurity, but being exposed for the fraud I was triggered the introspection. 

I would say definitely confront her. Talk to her about it, let her see that she isn't fooling people, and that there are consequences for dishonesty. She won't like it, but she may end up a better person for it.;;;Hey I actually have some experience with this!

In my sophomore year of high school we had a new girl who was transferred mid year. We were told by our advisor that she had been through some awful stuff at her last school and to treat her gently. My little band of misfits quickly absorbed her into our group and she told us that she had been sexually abused by a teacher at her last school. She was in therapy and getting help. We all liked her but she did have a habit of over exaggerating. 

Things got really bad the next year when another girl, Annie, in our class started having trouble at home. We all rallied around her to support her, and I think because the other girl was getting attention for her misfortune the new girl just kind of freaked out. She started telling all kinds of crazy stories about how her mom was abusing her, making her sleep outside, throwing her down stairs etc. but none of it added up. She was always clean and never mentioned being hungry and when she claimed that she hurt her ankle from her mom’s abuse we all distinctly remember her tripping over another girl and twisting it in school the day before. She swore us to secrecy. It was hell. Eventually things came to a head when Annie’s sister committed suicide. The new girl claimed that she was going to kill herself too once the play we were in closed. We told a teacher and she was institutionalized. She came out a few weeks later and seemed much better. I’m glad we told a teacher and not her parents because all the stuff she told us could have been true and she would have gotten even more abuse. By telling a teacher we were able to get her the help she actually needed. I don’t doubt that she was abuse do by that teacher at her old school, and I bet it’s what turned her into a pathological liar in the first place. 
You should take your sister’s lies as a sign of a serious problem.;;;&gt; side note, but is it weird that i’m so close with her considering the age gap? part of me thinks it is but oh well.

A little unusual, but not weird. Siblings, even half-siblings, can develop close relationships despite age gaps, particularly if they've been through traumatic times together.

&gt; I want to have a closer relationship with her because i know it hurts her that we don’t, but it’s hard when i can’t believe what comes out of her mouth. I’m honestly fine with leaving our relationship as is.

If you're fine with your relationship as it is, then that's a good sign that you don't need to push the issue.

Here's the thing: young teenagers often tell a lot of stories that aren't strictly true. They're technically lies, but in many cases they're for nothing more than getting attention.

At some level, she may just want attention from others. But truthfulness is also an issue, and she needs to learn to be honest.

You can address both of those by saying that you're happy to sit and talk any time she wants to talk - but she needs to be truthful. Let her know that you're not sure that everything she's told you is the truth - but that you're willing to let it go, and still be a friend to her, as long as she can be truthful going forward.;;;No it's not weird at all. I'm 25 my younger brother is 14. He and I can game and talk for hours about all the lovely nerdy things we enjoy. I gladly take him for overnights just so we can have the time together especially now that I live so much further away. I have a older brother who's 5 years older and we are the same. I have another brother who's 5 years younger than me and we *hate* eachother weirdly hes my only full sibling, all siblings are different. You're chillen'. ;;;delete 'hey' and 'so' as they are just filler and don't work in a serious text.;;;I don't think I've ever felt like my relationship with a liar has improved after talking to them about it. The only way I've been able to get them to stop is to just not feed them attention and accept that what they say isn't based in reality. 

However, when family lies like you say is happening here it really feels like you need to make sure their whole life doesn't continue on like this. Your best bet is to just send that message and if you get a response then leave it alone for a while. If you have a back and forth with a liar the whole conversation becomes an empty painful reminder. ;;;Try to remember that lying like your sister lies is sometimes a coping mechanism for things like sexual abuse. Things might have went down like she said they did, or they might have happened differently. There's a good chance she doesn't even know what actually happened. I remember when I was assaulted, I actually thought my roommate did it for about two weeks because she was the one I saw when I came out of the PTSD blackout (although women don't have semen, so IDK what I was on).

For context, I'm not alone. A lot of people who have been assaulted lie about stuff like this. Here are some other things I've heard of people doing (I was in foster care, a narrow majority of people I knew had been sexually assaulted at some time or another):

\-One girl lied about the identity of her assailant in order to protect the person who actually did it, who was a close relative. The person who she accused had ""conveniently"" gone on a missionary trip to a foreign country. Unfortunately, her lie was exposed in an amniocentesis (she was pregnant). She was placed in a group home until the brother could be indicted. 

\-One boy pretended his assailant was a woman because he didn't want to be perceived as ""gay"" by the other (more violent) boys in the group home. He only confessed the truth while he was drunk.

\-One girl pretended that she had never been assaulted in the first place because she was concerned her parents would throw her out of their home. She wasn't wrong.

\-Four girls I knew lied about their assaults because their families had basically abused them into silence. It's worth noting that this might be what happened here; there's a good chance your grandmother would lie to protect the assailant, depending on who it is. 

\-One girl completely blocked out the event. No one knew why she would randomly start attacking any white man who came near her until they read her file. It took her the better part of a year to regain her memories, and what she eventually told all of us still haunts me nearly thirteen years later. 

And honestly, something happened. People don't just start lying over nothing. Maybe the particulars aren't aligning for you (because she's either obfuscating or she doesn't entirely remember what happened), but honestly, they don't have to. You may have already blown your chance by telling your grandmother and your other sister this stuff, but if you haven't, you can act as a trusted adult and help your sister seek therapy.;;;Well if it truly upsets you, yes talk to her about it.

I wouldn't storm in angrily but I'd be stern about it, she shouldn't be doing that shit and she needs to realize her lies will have consequences.

If you think its necessary, alert the parent's to this.

I get you want to have a good relationship with her but her continuing to lie could lead to more trouble.;;;Side note. The age gap between you and your younger sister is not weird. It's nice when sisters can be good friends.;;;I have a cousin who is exactly like this. She lies her head off all damn day long and always trys to get me in trouble. Went to spend a week with her and she asked me to do hard drugs with her and I said no. Turns around and tells all the family I tried taking her cancer medications and was trying to get her to do drugs. They all knew she was lying, but that's besides the point. 
The point is, people like this don't change. I've tried being my cousins friend my entire life and it just doesn't get better. You can confront but most likely its just going to start drama where she starts to lie about you. 
My best advice would be just nod your head along and try to be the best family you can without subjecting yourself to her drama. It's hard but sometimes it's all you can do. ;;;She's 15 and still very much a dumb kid. This is something her parents need to handle, not you.

Tell them about her constant lies, and the serious shit she has lied about recently. This is no small thing, and her lies could get people into trouble.

Tell your parents, dude. Let them deal with and punish her. They created that monster...somehow.

Not your problem. :) ;;;",1553873544.0,b6ypv3,t3_b6ypv3,47,22,/r/relationships/comments/b6ypv3/little_sister_15_always_lies_and_this_time_lied/,"Some backstory: Basically my one little sister has a lying issue. She’s done this for as long as I can remember, and we all know about it. They moved far away like 3 years ago and until then, i was never super close with any of them. It was like a normal half sibling relationship i guess. We texted every couple of weeks and talked sometimes. I visited them for a couple weeks last summer and got really close with my other little sister (13. side note, but is it weird that i’m so close with her considering the age gap? part of me thinks it is but oh well.) and she became like one of my best friends, and that upset the older one that we didn’t hang out or talk that much. 

Since that vacay, i text the older one every couple of weeks and the other one like every other day. After i talk with the older one, i often have to talk with the younger one and have to fact check with her, since she’s always saying some dumb shit that i don’t know if it’s true.

I went down there last week and almost didn’t spend time with her again, but on the last night my other sister went to sleep early so i went to her room and we started talking. We talked for like 2 hours about some pretty serious stuff (her parents cheating, abuse, other relationships, and childhood trauma) and i tried putting the thought that anything she was saying could be a lie aside, but then i caught her in a stupid small lie and called her out for it, and that made me question everything else we talked about. After i got back, i talked to my grandma about her parents cheating and sx abuse when we were younger to see if it was true, and nope. Last night i talked to my other sister about it and other stuff too and again, no. The thought that she made all that terrible stuff up and I opened up and was honest with her just pisses me off. Maybe it’s my fault for trying to trust her. 

I was gonna text her this:

&gt;hey

&gt;so i’ve gotta be honest with you. why do you always lie and over-exaggerate stuff? like all the time. i tried to have a real conversation with you the last night i was there, and i tried putting the thought that you could be making it all up aside, but then i caught you in a lie, and after thinking about it, i’m pretty sure most of what you said isn’t true. you wondered why im closer with (other sister) and don’t talk to you as much and it’s because i can’t believe anything that comes out of your mouth. i love you dude but it really hurts not to be able to believe anything you say. you need to stop

but i really don’t want to hurt her or start any drama. should i just let her lie and forget about it? I want to have a closer relationship with her because i know it hurts her that we don’t, but it’s hard when i can’t believe what comes out of her mouth. I’m honestly fine with leaving our relationship as is. 

tl;dr: sister lied about terrible stuff and i’m mad. should i be? should i talk to her about it?",relationships,"Little sister [15] always lies, and this time lied about some serious and terrible stuff and honestly I’m [18m] kinda pissed. Should i be? Should I talk to/confront her about it?"
t2_3i7k1sbb,"You're 20. Why are you letting your parents dictate who you date?;;;You date her.

Yes, dating someone with a handicap will be different. It can be challenging in ways other relationships wouldn't be. Ask your parents what they would want you to do if you dated and married someone *and then* they became a paraplegic. Get a divorce? They sound pretty traditional, so I'm guessing that would be a no.

Ask them for specifics. What, exactly, do they think the problems will be. Her ability to have kids might be a big one, but maybe that's less important to you. Maybe your parents don't know that being a paraplegic doesn't necessarily mean someone can't have kids. Maybe they worry that you'll be judged by society, but again maybe that doesn't matter to you or you feel comfortable overcoming it. If you get their specifics you can try to address their concerns. If they stay kind of vague you can't even have a conversation.

Do this *calmly.* You are an adult, considering adult issues, with other adults, and adults talk about things calmly. They break down problems and consider consequences of decisions and decide things calmly. Confidently! Don't back down if you want something. But don't freak out or respond if they freak out. Your parents may not be used to thinking of you as an adult, so think about how to have this conversation in a way that reinforces that you are making a mature and knowledgeable decision with full consideration of the consequences. You are not a child acting on an impulse. Think about your parents and how they want to see you as an adult and try to be that adult they want to see. It can have a profound impact on the mood of the conversation and how they interpret your decision.

You sound... cultural. Traditional maybe? Basically just not white/american. I'd suggest trying to tailor the conversation to your culture. Fight for what you want, but in a way that appeals to your parents to get their acceptance. Appeals to how they want to see you in that culture and addresses the consequences they're worried about in that culture. It sounds important to you to get their acceptance, so you probably can't simply dismiss them straight up. You need to figure out a way to be confidently who they want you to be, but that also requires them to give you the independence to make the decision for yourself.;;;If you still date her, against your parent's will, what would they do to you?;;;You are an adult; you follow your heart and tell your parents that this is what you want. They either accept or they dont, it is their problem.

The meaning of life us to be happy.

If your parents cannot see that, they dont care about your happuness enough or they are just stupid.

Harder life or not, you should do as your heart desires, and there is nothing that can come in the way. You are not dependant on their opinions, you have your own life.

So live it. 👍

Edit: sorry for the typos, mobile here;;;My best friend's husband is disabled and it's funny but we were talking about this yesterday. He's her soulmate and all of that jazz.. been together over a decade, still happy. But, there are aspects of her life that are sheer misery. It's stuff related to medical expenses, work, security, and a whole bunch of grown up fucking expensive problems. 

Your parents know about all the potential problems of living a life with someone who isn't physically able. They don't get the bubbly lovie dovie feelings that mitigate it and make it all worth while. So, they are going to advise you from that view. 

Are you in a non western culture? I'm trying to figure out how they have any influence on this? ;;;&gt;but **her condition** may cause me some trouble if We decided to marry later.

Really? Cause some trouble? Please ask your parents to elaborate. Because unless you're going to live in a 6th floor walkup in NY, I really don't see how much trouble a wheelchair is going to cause. ;;;You have a choice. You listen to your parents and enable them to now choose who you can and can’t date for the rest of your life, or you make a choice yourself and give yourself the ability to choose who you want to date.

You’re 20. If you let them choose for you now, where does it end? 25? 30? 35? Imagine this;

“Hey Suzy. I’m really into you and I know you’re really into me but... my parents said I’m not allowed to date you.”

You need some scope into the independence your parents aren’t giving you. ;;;I'll start with this adage: ""Nothing ventured, nothing gained"".

If the two of ye feel the way ye do about each other, there shouldn't be much stopping you from being together.

Your parents have a point, in that certain duties may befall you, in terms of her future care, etc. But this can happen to people who are not physically disabled. A mental illness is often one that affects couples in a similar way. 

Q: does she have a fairly conventional life?
As in, how much does her disability affect her daily life?

To my thinking, the two of you should give it a go. Be realistic in your ability to cope with future 'troubles', and communication is key.

Keep us updated!!

Good luck!!;;;I see from your comments that the reason you are letting your parents control you is because you live with them and don't have a job. I would say that you should move out and get a job, but I know it's not always that easy. I would say that you should go behind their backs, but it would probably hurt her feelings too much knowing tha they disapprove. 

How about saying to them: ""her parents already know that she is interested in dating me and I like her too, so if I am going to end things with us, I need to be honest with them about why and I will be forced to tell them what you have said about her disability."" If they are afraid of being socially embarassed, maybe they will back down.;;;You should date her! But try to talk to them about it again. Do it as calmly as possible. It seems like they love her already and it might not take them very long to change their minds. 
I'm glad you found someone who makes you feel this way. Try and focus on your happiness.;;;News flash! You're an adult.  If you both connect, go for it. ;;;Get yourself a job, stop living with your parents, and date her. Treat her how you think she deserves and tell your parents to mind their own. ;;;Date her. You are an adult. You make your own decisions.;;;My parents hated my husband when they first met him. Nearly a decade later they realized how wrong they were and adore him. Do what's best for you. You're an adult.;;;Don't let your parents decide who you date but you do need to realize what it means to date someone with a mobility disability like hers.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are wanting to date in the hopes of marriage you need to realize that you will eventually become a caretaker or find a job that pays you enough to hire a care taker. Being a care taker for someone with a severe disability like this is very hard and emotionally draining for both people involved. 

&amp;#x200B;

It would be best to research these things before hand and try to truthfully evaluate yourself on a mental and emotional level whether or not you can take care of someone properly without burning yourself out.

&amp;#x200B;

Your parents are worried that you will get into this relationship without thinking of every aspect that comes with a disability (kids, marriage, finding a house with mobility help like ramps, vehicles that are made for wheelchairs, financially caring for someone with a disability) and then get to a point where you feel ""stuck"" and resent her or vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

Even people who take care of their own parents get this way. Cleaning up after someone (bathroom wise), helping them get in and out of bed and dressed, bed sores, depression and anxiety. Then there is trying to figure out sex even on top of that which is a common reason for divorce!

&amp;#x200B;

Don't let your parents control who you date but make sure you are thinking of everything on a mature level (as much as you can) before getting this girl's hopes up.;;;What a load of horseshit from your parents. You're 20 years old you go date that girl! 

EDIT: This makes me so mad, Im not done. Holy shit Im angry! How *dare* your parents talk about that poor girl like that! What business is it of theirs what complications there will or will not be down the road? You don't ask them for a damn thing here. *Inform* them that you are head over heels for this girl,and  that you rhink she is really special.

If your parents have a problem with her because of her disability, inform them that by some miracle you turned out better than either of them, that they are terrible people, and you are ashamed to be their son.;;;If it’s an issue of the loss of potential grandchildren,there’s always adoption.;;;You are an adult. If you really like this girl, you should be with her. I think you should have a serious talk with your parents about how hurtful their comment was. Perhaps they’re just worried for you, but it came across very rude. Handicapped people are just as worthy of love and having relationships as anyone else. They know and like the family, they know and like her, what’s the problem? Refusing to see past her wheelchair is very close-minded of them. If you make each other happy, that’s all that matters. I hope if they’re reasonable people they will come around eventually. ;;;Fuck your parents. Love trumps all so follow your heart! Also fuck the idea that this girls handicap will somehow make marrying her more difficult, because last I checked all relationships are hella difficult, but the best things in life aren’t easy;;;What!?!?!?? Dude marry her if your feelings say so. Its YOUR life and the person who you choose till death due you apart should not be determined by the parents. Your parents are worried about that you might regret it but if you are 100% sure that she is the one then its not their decision at all. Plus this is straight out of a romantic movie where they stay together and live happily ever after lol.;;;",1553903557.0,b74ixv,t3_b74ixv,41,20,/r/relationships/comments/b74ixv/i_love_a_handicapped_girl_but_my_parents_wont/,"I am 20 years old..I have been studying in this collage near my house for around 2 years and a half ...
Last summer a family came to our Naibourhood and rent this house across our's.

A middle aged man and his wife and 19 years old paraplegics (can't walk ) girl and two boys who still study in school.

We became a close neighbors ..they invited us to dinner several times and so we did.

At one dinner I discovered that they came to our town because this girl (surprise surprise) is going to study in the same college that I am studying in that is 7 miles away from my house.

Once we knew that 
..My dad suggested that I would pick her up to collage since i was driving my own car to collage and everyone agreed ..
The little dad knew that his idea started the flare between me and her ...the flare that he later would want to go away.

Every day we talked when we were going to collage
I knew from her that she had an accident when she was 6 years old which unfortunately made her handicapped...
The thing with this girl that she is extremely beautiful ..short brown hair blue eyes and a smile to steal the heart of the moon ...annnnnd she is really kind and shy ...probably the kindest and shiest person I have ever met in my life.

Really fast we started to become close friends...sometimes after college we would go to restaurant or cinema...
I am pretty certain she started to have a crush on me ...and so did I.

Without me knowing she asked her parents about having a serious relationship with me (around 6 months after they moved) and they were very happy about that ...she told me that they said it is healthy for her to have relationship since she never had a one ..and ofcourse because of her ""special condition"" and apparently I earned their trust as a good polite guy.

I was the happiest person on earth that day and I immediately went to tell my parents and then came the shocking moment.

They completely refused the idea of me having a serious relationship with her.

They told me that they think her family is extremely kind and everything and the girl is sweet and beautiful but her condition may cause me some trouble if We decided to marry later.

I am now very desperate...
I mean I have never met a girl that connects with me the way she does ...it is like she is my soulmate ...
She is still waiting for an answer and i just cannot tell her that..it would break her heart 
What do I do 😥.

TL;DR :this post is about me asking for help in this kind of complicated situation",relationships,I love a handicapped girl but my parents won't allow me to have a relationship with her
t2_34yrj78b,"Your husband is abusive, OP, and you need to get out. If you can't do this for yourself, consider the fact that as your daughter grows, your husband will start doing the things he does to you to *her.*

Your daughter will learn that any mistake - even the smallest - is met with terrifying anger, yelling, and that *it's her fault.*

Your daughter will learn that any attempt to assert her own opinion will be met with terrifying anger, yelling, and that her opinion is *wrong*, always wrong. (How will this prepare her for sexual attention from men as she gets older? What lessons will she learn about her right and the safety of saying 'no'?)

Your husband will pin her against furniture and walls when she 'disobeys'.

Your daughter will learn, through your own example, that it is good and right for her to sacrifice her safety, her comfort, her self-esteem, and her opinions in service to fixing angry, broken men. That she is bad and selfish if she wants to have a relationship that doesn't look like yours.;;;This is 100% abuse. 

It’s better to be from a broken home than grow up in one. Get your daughter out of there and go for as much custody as the legal system will grant you, because if you stay, she will be messed up badly. ;;;I actually stopped reading when you said he pinned you down on the bed.

Everything you are doing is excusing, rationalizing, and normalizing his terrible behavior.

He rationalizes it to get away with it. You say it back to yourself to avoid the painful, difficult task of leaving.

He will never get better, and your daughter will grow up thinking this behavior is normal and find someone just like him. 

Leave as soon as you have an exit strategy.;;;Honey, omg, you are being abused... And so is your baby. I know reddit is quick to pull the divorce card, but please, for your daughter, get a divorce. 

He is dangerous. I know it may not seem like it all the time, but he is. He screamed at you in FRONT of your daughter. Whenever you hesitate about leaving, whenever he makes promises to change- and if he hasn't in 10 years, he won't- remember your daughter's face going white and her laying there stiff as a board.

One healthy parent is more than enough- but you need to leave. Please see an attorney, or if you can't, please go to your county courthouse and speak to a victim's advocate. They will help put you in touch with people who will help you for free.
;;;Your husband is ticking a LOT of the boxes for pathological narcissism. Does this (The Narcissist's Prayer) sound like him?

""That didn't happen. And if it did, it wasn't that bad. And if it was, it wasn't a big deal. And if it is, that's not my fault. And if it was, I didn't mean it. And if I did, then you deserved it."" 

If so, I implore you to educate yourself about what you might be up against here. No amount of therapy will ""fix"" him and, in fact, couples therapy is discouraged with a narcissistic spouse. 

Even aside from all that, your husband's history of abuse (emotional, verbal and physical) is a HUGE red flag that you and your daughter are in danger. Please get out while you can.  ;;;&gt;What do I do? A divorce? Is that better for my little girl? Growing up a child of divorced parents? Potentially a messy co-parenting situation in which I cannot protect her when she is with him? Or her growing up without a dad in her life? What is the right thing to do here?

I'm going to be horribly blunt: you continue to stay with him, you are lying to yourself that you can ""protect"" your daughter from her dad's abusive, scary anger. 

You cannot even protect yourself. 

Instead, your daughter is going to grow up thinking daddy screaming, browbeating and physically assaulting mommy is ""normal"". She's gonna grow up to be messed up because that is what children who grow up in abusive households are. 

And I'm warning you: one day, when she's 18 (or maybe 16, 17, 19), your daughter is going to ghost your husband. She'll do anything to get out of your household: either (hopefully) running away to college and never coming back home, or (not hopefully) dating some stupid 25 year old who promises to rescue her from her home, offering her body and her youth to some older man as the price to pay to leave. 

And when she leaves the house, she's probably going to leave you behind too. For failing to protect her from your husband. ;;;First thing I would do like you are doing is document everything, and get a lawyer. Decide what you really want and I understand your daughter comes first but if you are put in a situation where you don't make it out then he is all she has. Do you really want that? 

Domestic violence, emotional abuse is no joke. 

I don't want to say get out while you can as I know you love him. But he's already put his hands on you. What happens if he hits too hard?;;;Do you want your daughter to grow up watching him treat you like this, learning that this is what a normal relationship is like? ;;;k so he is obviously a trash can and abusive, but I'm just so taken aback by this:

""He did not deserve that.""

He... didn't deserve you getting something for your child?  I'm flabbergasted. ;;;OP, you're fighting and he's gotten physical. No more doubts: you both are not in a good place to be parent to that girl if this is what you're doing together around her. That means you have to be coparents separately. Your baby might not remember these incidents, but the older they get, the more they learn and remember. It's kind of like nicotine, it soaks up in the environment, even if one does't participate in smoking and sticks to them. 

You also have to act now, because your child will be alone with him, he's their daddy still. Getting a custody arrangement with maybe anger management is something she could be benefitting from. It's not likely a step he'll take on his own and she's cute and adorable now, but when she's a bratty teen it's a different battle. 

Heal as individuals. See who you are on your own. You've been with this guy a significant time in your life and you've accepted behaviour that you didn't really agree with. You are your daughters biggest example, she'll look at you to see how you set boundaries and how to respond to a loved one. She''ll look at her dad to learn how he treats you and what she should be expecting from future partners. You're not going to teach her right in your current situation.

Consider calling a local DV shelter. They can advise you about how to get legal advice and how to stay safe. Very practical info is given. Call in your network too, you'll need them. But first make that decision if you go. If you go, don't ever go back.;;;So we have the usual dozen comments calling abuse for what it is. Agree with them 100%, you need to leave because he's not going to stop. Your *best case scenario* is that he just does the things he is already doing, and he doesn't get worse, and he is already an awful awful person. The worst case scenario he bashes your head in one day because you left the thermostat too high or some other stupid bullshit. 

But I wanted to touch on rage, and anger, and losing your temper. Because I see you taking the blame for his actions because you made a mistake with the fish, or acting like it's your fault he screamed at you because you were being passive aggressive. 

People are human. People make mistakes. People can react to those mistakes in different ways, and those reactions are something that is entirely, 100% in the control of those people. My father has enormous anger issues, and he would yell and scream and stomp around the house and lose his shit over all manner of things. I absolutely inherited this trait of having an enormous temper. I am very quick to anger and it flashes white hot. But how I express that anger, that's 100% in my control. Inheriting my father's temper, that's genetics. How I choose to channel and curb that temper, that's in the choices I make. 

My wife, a couple weeks ago, was taking a bath. She took a beverage in the bath with her, that was in a glass. Glass, tired wife on her phone, slippery tub, nice strong drink combined and the glass broke. When I heard it break from the other room, I was fucking pissed. This was, to me, an entirely foreseeable result of her decisions. It could have been easily avoided by using a plastic cup instead of a glass. I think, and I still think, that she made a stupid decision and caused an easily avoided problem. I actually don't think that's even arguable. She fucked up, it wasn't some kind of crazy one in a million occurrence.  

So, I clenched my fists, and cracked my knuckles, and then I let out a long, forceful breath. These are my coping strategies for pushing that white hot spike of rage away. Then I got up, went into the bathroom, and I picked up the pieces of the glass, put the bathmat in the washer, and mopped up the puddle with a towel, sprayed it down with cleaner, wiped it dry, and swept for little glass bits. What I said to her was ""I really liked that glass, it's probably a good idea to use a plastic cup for your bathtub drinks going forward"". 

I'm sharing that not to brag about how awesome I am, but to illustrate that someone who actually does have a super fiery hot temper, and who grew up with a father who modeled incredibly poor behavior in his family relationships, can in fact react to his wife's mistakes with a constructive approach. 

""I have a bad temper, you know that"" is not an excuse for his behavior. ""It's how my father acted, I know I shouldn't do it, but it's how I was raised"" is not an excuse either. ""You caused all the fish to get eaten"" is not an excuse for his behavior. ""You were being passive aggressive"" is not an excuse for his behavior. There is a constructive way to respond to mistakes or poor behavior on the part of a spouse, and screaming and using physical violence is not part of that toolkit. ;;;Yes. Divorce. This man is unstable, violent, manipulative and highly dangerous. Trust me your baby is already picking up on the aggression and fear in the home. Get you and your baby out of this asap. ;;;Go. As safely and quickly as possible.;;;He gets to walk away from you in arguments, but he doesn't give you that luxury. It's a double standard. Walking away is never an act of aggression, it can cause anger in an entitled person. Walking away tends to be an effort to diffuse tension, calm down and hash it out later. He isn't willing to do that for you. When he walks away, its to punish you (for days) instead of just a short cooling period- but heaven forbid you walk away for five minutes (while he takes whole days). 

He is dismissive and won't own his wrongs. He also does not accept relationship repairs (apologies, instead he wants you to feel bad). You have all the makings for resentment and none of the foundations for a truly loving relationship and conflict resolution. What worse, is he doesn't want to learn them- and you cannot make him. This is dead. 

You are being abused. This does not get better, your child will think this is normal. Do you want your daughter to have a husband that treats her this way? ;;;I agree with everyone else, and I'll add that CPS automatically gets involved when children are exposed to domestic violence. Don't wait on this. If you want custody, let them see that you're serious about protecting your child. 

Go to your local police station and get an emergency protective order immediately. Write down a timeline of everything that's happened and state that your daughter was present for some of it. You can ask for whatever provisions you want - restraining order, emergency custody, him to vacate the house, etc. It's temporary, it's free, and most judges grant them very easily to be on the safe side. They'll give you a hearing date within a few weeks to decide whether it should be extended to something more permanent. 

File for divorce at the same time. Ideally you'll get the same judge to hear the DV case and the divorce case. 

I'd also contact your neighbor, landlord's son, etc. DV hearings aren't like a criminal trial where you have to prove he did it, but you do need enough evidence to make the judge think abuse most likely occurred. Luckily the standards for evidence aren't very high and you're allowed to include things like journal entries if you've been writing anything down. 

Even if you don't think you have enough evidence, it's best to speak up now. If this continues to happen, the police will have it on record for the future. 

Good luck! 

Also, abuse does weird things to your psychology. Once you're out you should probably see a therapist. There aren't enough positive traits in the world to balance out this man's behavior or to justify staying with him. 

&amp;#x200B;;;;Yeah, I didn’t even read it all, I read down to where your piece of shit husband has the audacity to blame YOU for his aggression because you were terrified, picked up your baby and walked away.

OP, it doesn’t matter how nice your partner is to you when things are going well if they’re an angry screaming nutcase to you when things are going badly. Please for the love of god get your baby out of this environment.;;;You need to get somewhere safe. For you. I grew up in this very situation and i am telling you your little girl will remember every second of anger and every flash of fear in your eyes. Every time you pack your bags and dont leave. And there is a possibility that she will blame herself for you staying. She needs you to get somewhere safe.;;;Whew, OP. Your post sent my shoulders up around my ears just reading it.

I was married to this guy. Like, these exact behaviors: the over-reactions, the twisting of truth, the blame game, the shuffling myself and baby room to room to protect us, the showing back up in two days and expecting affection, then flipping out again when I wasn’t feeling particularly affectionate toward him.

Let me tell you: this is not normal. I too bought into the false equivalency of my imperfections=his conscious decisions to be scary. No one is perfect, but ‘I forgot to turn a thing back on’ *in no way merits the response* ‘now I follow you around and make you fear me’. You are not ‘triggering’ him, he is embodying that old ‘why do you make me hit you’ trope.

And the guilt. Ohhh the guilt. I remember holding my baby at night crying, saying, ‘I’m so sorry. I’m so, so sorry’ over and over again. I asked the very questions of myself you asked here. I’m willing to bet you’re not even telling us the worst of it, right? I know I didn’t tell a soul. The shame was so overwhelming.

It took me a looong time to use the word ‘abuse’. It took me a long time to realize this isn’t what people mean by the ‘work’ of a marriage, or that other people are allowed to make mistakes without their partner berating and intimidating them over it. It took until every emotion was ground out of me to be able to see clearly that leaving was the only option. It wasn’t until I regained control of my life that I realized just how out of control I had been. 

Single parenthood is hard. So hard. But at the end of the day, not being subjected to the whims of a petty tyrant is 1000 times better. I can tell you right now, if you stay, you will spend all of your time and energy running interference between him and your daughter. Toddlers are unpredictable; how do you think he’ll deal with that? Do you want her to feel the kind of anxiety you do, scared to ‘trigger’ daddy?

Of course you don’t, you clearly love her a great deal. Call a DV org near you, they can help with legal assistance and safety planning. Only you know your situation, but the line to hold is: I will not be treated like this. I will not be disrespected. Once my ex realized I was no longer afraid of him, he lost all power and left willingly. He went to therapy, actually blossomed into a good parent and we have a decent co-parenting relationship. Not everyone is so lucky, so a safety plan is very important. 

Just here from the other side saying: you don’t have to live like this. Leaving my ex freed me up to meet a wonderful, generous, caring man who would never, ever make me afraid of him. Who, one time when I left the soda on the counter instead of putting it back and started apologizing profusely, looked at me quizzically and said: why sorry? It’s not like I’m gonna yell at you about it. 

You aren’t broken, he is trying to break you. Don’t let him. 
;;;Look up the fun stats on likelihood of being murdered by an intimate partner and how they connect with being choked. He's put his hands on your neck. He doesn't have empathy. You need to get away from this guy. Document document document, get a great lawyer, rake him over the coals and fight for every dime and supervised visitation on the basis of him not caring about the harmful impact his abuse toward you could have on your child.;;;In addition to all the great points made, I'd like to say that Russia is the biggest country by surface area, followed by Canada,  USA, and China. Mexico is #14.;;;Absolutely 100% leave. He has seemingly acknowledged there is a problem, but doesn’t want to seek therapy because of some bullshit about labeling the relationship “broken”?

I mean, that is the weakest ass excuse I’ve ever heard. There is a significant problem, your husband’s aggression and anger is scary, and HE DOES NOT WANT TO FIX IT.

Do you really want to be in that situation? Is it possible to raise a child who feels safe, strong, and thrives in an environment like this?

No one here is going to tell you experiences of abusers who stopped and got better because those don’t exist. This is the classic abuse pattern. He blames you because you triggered him (more excuses for behaving violently). He may apologize. But it only gets worse and more violent from here. Even if him changing WAS a possibility, you and your child deserve — everyone deserves! — to live with someone who would *never* threaten or hurt them the way your husband already has, more than once.

Time to go. Make a plan. Today. Don’t go back. Stay safe. ;;;Please, leave him. I am 16 years old and your and your husband's relationship is almost exactly the same as my grandparents', it's like looking into the past. I see him blow up at her all the time for stupid things, like he just wants to always be angry about something. I truly believe getting out would be the best thing for you and your baby girl.;;;Op, you're being abused. The abuse started 10 years ago when you met this man, and it's never going to stop. For the sake of both your child and yourself, leave this man as soon as possible. ;;;Everyone's already telling you to leave for your and your daughter's safety, which I agree with, so I want to emphasize that you should get a therapist after this, OP. Dealing with abuse for so long can do a lot of things to you, therapy will help you heal after you're out.;;;This man is a monster, and he's gaslit you badly enough that you believe your share some responsibility for his psychotically violent behavior.  You aren't safe, and your child is not safe.

Document every instance of abuse, physical and emotional/verbal.  Go to a divorce lawyer, and make an escape plan.

Also realize that by staying with him, your child is already in a broken home with an abuser.  It is absolutely not good for children to grow up in this environment, having divorced parents is 1000% better than having married parents, one of whom abuses everyone in the house.  Being abusive to you is by default abusing the child, children know what's going on at home, no matter how much you delude yourself into thinking you are hiding the abusive behavior.  

This is not your fault, but you have an obligation and duty to protect your child, and you can't do that by staying with this man.

Leave, as safely as your can, but leave.

As someone who grew up with parents who abused each other, and thought it was okay because ""they never hurt their child,"" your child is absolutely being damaged by staying in that relationship.;;;It is far, far better to grow up a child of divorce than to grow up in an abusive household. And what your daughter is currently in is an abusive household. The right thing to do for your daughter is to get her out of that household and stop rationalizing his abuse. It's only going to escalate.;;;It’s easier for a child to get a divorce early in their life so their life doesn’t change all that dramatically. She won’t remember any of this, it would be better to do it now then later. ;;;

&gt;Tell me more. You are so smart, you know so much. And he flipped the lid. He screamed at me: What the fuck is wrong with you, you’re just like all the others, why does nobody believe me, why does everybody doubt what I say. 

&gt;He demanded I do one more thing because he didn’t agree with MY assessment for MY portion of the work that he knew a lot less about and than me and could not really assess. 

&gt;It feels like he sees my accomplishments, in some way, as his own.

Please check out /r/NarcissisticAbuse. The less time your daughter spends with him, the better.

/r/RaisedByNarcissists is a good preview of what she'll experience.

---

Everybody else has touched on his physical violence enough so I won't repeat that.;;;Imagine your daughter as a teenager. Really see her in your mind; all awkward and pretty and young. 

Do you want her first boyfriend to be a guy like this? Do you want her to wake up in the night feeling scared? 

If you stay, he might very well be. You will teach her; look, my baby, this is how men love women.

Do you want her to marry a guy like this?

She is so young still. If you leave now, she won't remember. And you'll meet a kind guy later, who'll love you genuinly. Like you love your daughter. With kindness.
Then that will be the type of boyfriend she'll look for. 

Leave for her. And for you. You both deserve better &lt;3 ;;;I was with your husband's long lost twin brother for over 8 years and had kids with him. It's 1,000% not worth it. Soon enough he'll start being like that with your daughter. I promise.

Get out and get as much custody time as you can.

P.S. A book recommendation: Why Does He Do That by Lundy Bancroft (I think it's available free online).;;;OP, you're rationalizing abuse. Get out before your husband kills you and your baby. Seriously, please protect your child. He's already pinning you down, it will only get worse.;;;Your situation sounds pretty awful.



First of all, he should be in therapy to deal with his rage issues. If he is unwilling or unable to acknowledge that he has a problem, get out, take your child, and do not look back.



If you *know* your husband is abusive,  by not removing yourself and your child from that environment, I think you are complicit. If he is that scary/dangerous, he should not have unsupervised access to you or your child.



And no. Staying together ""for the kids"" is never a good idea.



He needs his own therapist. You and he probably need therapy together. If that's not an option, I don't see any choice other than getting out, assuming you don't want this escalating into domestic violence. ;;;You need to leave if not for yourself but for the sake of your daughter. Coming from a broken home with divorced parents is not the same as growing up in a broken and abusive home. What your husband does/did to you, he will do it to his daughter when she's old enough because he doesn't see this as wrong. 

As someone who grew up with an abusive and angry dad, I can tell you that the abusive childhood I had has messed me up pretty badly. It took me several many years to even come to terms to recognise and acknowledge that my childhood was an abusive one. When I was younger, my dad was physically abusive. As I got older, he became emotionally and mentally abusive. He still is to this day and he is 70.

I remember how if I didn't do well at school he would be livid, he would berate me and slap me. In time to come, I would be so afraid of him that I would lie to him when I didn't do well. Which then intensified his anger and the severity of his beatings. He once took a bamboo pole and threatened to crack my skull open with it because I lied to him about not having gotten my exam grades back yet because I didn't do very well and I was scared.

I also remember a time when I once tried to decline helping him to run an errand. He lost his shit, hit and scolded me. That incident shaped me to who I still am today. Till today, I still have problems saying no to people because I learned at a young age that it wasn't ok to say no. There were many more incidents that happened well into to adulthood till this day that has continued to mess with my mental and emotional stability.

I am now 36 going on 37, and I still catch myself living for my father's approval and still navigating my way out of the mess I got from my childhood baggage. 

I urge you to leave for the sake of your daughter. The psychological impact that physical and emotional abuse that your husband will have on your daughter is way more far-reaching and detrimental than you can imagine. ;;;You stated in your post that he has physically threatened/harmed you, and it also sounds like he gaslights you constantly. He won’t accept blame for anything; and instead blames you for HIM acting aggressively. He refuses counseling. This many has some serious issues, and you should not stick around to wait for him to reach a point where he hurts you further, or hurts your CHILD. Get the hell out of that house, NOW. He is abusive and sounds like a narcissistic sociopath or something along those lines. Please get out of that house and get a divorce; this is not healthy for you or your child and things are not going to change. 

Once you have some distance from him and the relationship, you will start to see how messed up this all is and how terribly he’s treating you. 

Good luck;;;Reading this post broke my heart. You do not deserve to be treated this way!

Please make a plan to leave that takes the physical safety of you and your baby into account. ;;;You know your behaviour NEVER brings this on. It's always on him. Hes the one who loses control of his temper, who lashes out verbally and physically. You need to get away safely and you need real support, such as the police, when you do so. You do not sound safe and your daughter does not sound safe. He lifted you up by your throat? Multiple people have tried to step in and help you - people avoid these situations most of the time yet multiple times different people have tried to help because your situations have been so bad ;;;I know that it’s scary to have to make a decision like this...and you’re trying to do what is best for your child. 

I can tell you that it won’t get any better. 

I made the decision to leave after almost 20 years of being married to a very similar man. It was hard to start over, on my own, with children in tow....but in the years since, my children have told me that they understand why I left, and think it was best for everyone involved.

Don’t make excuses for him. You should never have to live in fear of your husband. Period.;;;Please read what you wrote and imagine- if this had been written by your best friend, your little sister, or even your daughter once she is an adult- what would you want them to do?

I would absolutely immediately get a good lawyer and move out with the child (Somewhere he probably won't find you) and put down the ultimatum- he attends personal and (maybe) couples counselling, and ideally anger management classes, or you divorce and file for full custody until he gets his anger and control issues under control with professional help. A trial separation might give you some clarity about how to go forward long-term.

I would also be prepared for him to absolutely go ballistic and I would be ready to file a restraining order. Hopefully the answers here help you see some clarity about how to proceed.

But his willingness to berate you in front of the child, and that this behavior extends to all of his relationships means it is just a matter of time before he starts treating your daughter the same way. An actively bad father is worse than no father. And leaving this person does not mean your kid will grow up without a father- you can always find a healthier relationship.;;;Omg. Get out and get your daughter out. Now. I still resent my late mother for allowing the abuse my father inflicted upon us--physical and mental. Don't make the same mistake. Please. ;;;What the fuck?


&gt;It has always been clear to me that he understood on some level after an incident that what he did was wrong.

This makes it worse.

&gt;I make a lot of mistakes. I tend to need space for myself. I can get annoyed which I know is so hurtful. When I’m stressed out, I get all flustered and overwhelmed. That’s bad and I know it, but I do own my stuff. 

Stop blaming yourself.

;;;Your instincts and fears are real.  The abuse is real.  You do not deserve to be treated the way your husband treats you.  You can see in your infant the terror and pain that you have suppressed in yourself to enable your survival. 

Please listen to the instinct that led you to post here.  Please don’t show him this post to try and convince him to improve.  Your daughter deserves to be loved and taught she is safe in the world.  You can’t teach her that in an environment where you don’t feel safe. You have the whole internets permission to leave so please give yourself that gift.  ;;;you should have been gone after getting screamed at for wanting to hear more about Mexico. It's very sad that you ended up tying yourself to an abusive man, but it absolutely isn't too late to salvage this and get out from under his abuse.

Listen to the advice on this thread about leaving.;;;The dismissing/questioning part is what got me. You are clearly so thoughtful about the dynamics of your relationship and what might make him tick. You're letting him in so far and letting his actions color and shape your view of what's normal. Love is so powerful, but imagine what it would be like if you didn't have to engage with what he think is OK or his justifications at all. Follow your instincts. Do you think this all is OK? That's the only question you have to answer.;;;You should go and talk to a lawyer. Explain that your husband has an anger problem and is abusive. Ask them what the likelihood of preventing him from getting visitation or shared custody would be. 

Document any incidents of verbal or physical abuse/intimidation. Consider the possibility of calling the cops the next time he starts up. 

I can understand your apprehension about leaving him and having a custody arrangement that would expose her to him without you. But growing up with an abusive father and a mother who won’t leave him is going to teach her that abuse is normal and something that she should endure from her future partners. ;;;My father had an explosive temper. I really wish my parents had divorced sooner. It was scary growing up with a live grenade as a parent. I have an overly developed fight or flight mechanism now, and am extremely defensive to the point where it caused problems in my marriage. I’ve gotten a lot of therapy, but I’m still sad for the little girl that had to live through hearing her father screaming.;;;Get a journal and start documenting every incident you can remember, all the details like time and dates. If you can record it on your phone. You will need this for the inevitable custody battle. Maybe call your local YMCA and see what else they advise. Good luck to you and your girl. People like to think kids are resilient, but they arent, so better to get her out now. ;;;You have to leave this situation. Your daughter will otherwise be raised think that this is a normal way to treat women. It is not. You deserve safety. Leave!;;;He's been escalating for 10 years.  It only gets worse, broken up by periods of waiting for it to get even worse.  If you stay, your daughter will learn to be afraid, either of what he's doing to you or what he'll do to her.  

Leave, and when you file for divorce detail his abuse and ask for sole custody with supervised visitation.  Push to tie any unsupervised visitation to his attending counseling.   Remember, you may be able to get away from this abuse, but if your daughter has visitation with him she risks becoming his next target or he might use her as a weapon to get to you.  Be vigilant on her behalf.;;;Please get out of this situation while you safely can and before anything happens to you or your daughter. I got more and more scared for you as your post went on. I have a 7 month old daughter myself and maybe that’s why I feel so strongly but I want to yell through the phone- get out before things escalate even further! I am very sorry you’re in this situation. It will not be easy but your number one priority is protecting your little girl from growing up in an abusive household, even if he never turns the abuse towards her (he will), she will at the very least grow up thinking that his behavior is normal. You need to start documenting everything with details, dates, etc if you haven’t already. You need to talk to a lawyer. Do you have family/friend support? Lean on people you trust. Sending absolute best wishes for you and your babygirl. ;;;Echoing the ""this is abuse"" comments, I have to point out that when you mentioned ""triggering"" him over him forgetting a swaddle... his gaslighting is getting to you. In other words, he's making this your fault and at times you believe him. If this were a healthy relationship, rather than screaming at you and insulting you, he'd have said ""hey, are you okay? you seem upset."" And then you guys would have had a discussion about it. And maybe you'd both be heated and a little annoyed, but there'd be no screaming and terrifying you or your little one. Don't ever, ever think that you've earned that kind of treatment from him, because you haven't. Please get into a safe situation for you and your daughter. ;;;Leave. Leave now, things will only get worse, you are already defending indefensible behavior. You do NOT want to raise your daughter around this.;;;Run, don’t walk. I’ve read 2 sentences into “ugly” and you should go. Not normal, not ok. Do not allow your child to grow up thinking it’s ok to treat/be treated this way. I’m going to read on praying you get to the “I have great family/friends and can easily pack up and go tonight” part.;;;You absolutely do not deserve this.  My almost-ex husband was the same - blowing up over something little, finding ways to blame it on me.  Never ever apologizing for anything he did.

Emotional and sexual abuse. I eventually I realized I was modeling putting up with abuse for my daughters and am so much happier now.;;;Divorce, for sure! But you need an exit plan. Call your local dv line. You should have dumped him when your gut told you to run after the very first incident you cited. Seek therapy. God bless.;;;""I triggered him""  No, honey, you didn't. He is a textbook case of abuser. Leave him now. You have already put up with too much for too long that is not only not normal but not acceptable. Save yourself and your child. ;;;Divorce is the best option for you and the baby. They actually did studies that found that babies were more severely affected by fighting and abuse within the home than young children. It was always assumed the opposite, that babies are too young to understand therefore would be rather insulated from abuse until they were older, but that was not the case. 

You have noticed numerous times now where he has completely lost it right in front of the baby. All that stress and fear you are feeling, is affecting the baby. Your body is telling you to be afraid from a reason, listen to it. You're scared, and you are scared due directly to the way he acts towards you and around you. 

The main issue is he refuses to get help. You have asked him to go to anger management, or therapy more than once and he refuses to do so. He refuses to accept responsibility for his wrongdoing and his temper has led him to put hands on you more than once already. Grabbing you by the neck may not have harmed you, what would it do to a little kid? These moments of out of control rage he experiences could wind up with your child getting hurt if he ever directed his anger towards the child (and he will). Not to mention the fighting and yelling will traumatize them. No child deserves to grow up seeing one parent be screamed at and scared by the other. 

The other issue and something you really need to consider is that if he does do something to your child, and you are still married to him and have not documented or reported any of his abuse, YOU can be held legally responsible for it too. 

If CPS were to get involved for instance, they could easily just revoke both of your parental rights because they would see him as being abusive and you as enabling it and not protecting your child. By divorcing him and citing his rage, his yelling and his instances of physical violence you are ensuring that your parental rights are protected, that your baby is protected and that if he ever did anything to her, it would not be able to fall back on you. You would still be seen as a fit and capable parent who separated from the abuser and who took protective action. If you remain married to him and he ever does something that could be considered abusive, your parental rights could be revoked. You could even be charged criminally as culpable if she got hurt.

You have already recounted that numerous people, including neighbors, have approached you about his behavior, believing you are being abused. When you have a child in the mix, what do you think people will do then? They won't just try to talk to you, they will call the police, they will contact CPS. At that point it is out of your hands, and if you are still married to this man, or trying to rationalize his behavior, you and your parental rights could go down with him.

Contact an attorney, document the reasons why you are leaving (the yelling, the instances of physical violence, the refusal to get help) and divorce. ;;;[removed];;;Op, please buy the book Why Does He Do That by Lundy Bancroft. Your husbands behavior is classic narcissistic abuse, this is all about power. That fuzzy feeling you get when you’re fighting like you don’t know which way is up? It’s gaslighting. This book will help you see very clearly what he is doing to you and how he is doing it. ;;;I'm so sorry you're going through this!! I feel so bad for you, and I don't mean that condescendingly at all! I've been in similar situations, not married and no children though, and that was bad enough. I know the feeling of begging someone to please, please be reasonable and dealing with violence, anger and complete disregard for me in response. It seems the baby may have escalated things a bit as you're now a mother and standing your ground more?

I guess I would recommend leaving. Personally, I would get ALL my ducks in a row on every level to do so. He seems unpredictable and I would likely do this in secret. Move far far away, get a restraining order, legally and socially block him and expose him. I imagine it would be a long drawn out process to do so, and I would definitely consult a lawyer. 

For your own sanity, and to help you frame your experiences with him I would educate myself on abuse. ""Why does he do that?"" By Lundy Bancroft might be helpful to you. I really wish you all the best. Please stay safe, keep yourself and your baby safe! Whatever it takes, you've got each other and I think you would probably both be better off without him in your lives...

;;;The good stuff sounds great.  But it is so outweighed by everything else in your post.  He is abusing you.  He will abuse your daughter too.  He has no insight and despite your best efforts has refused to go to counselling.  You should leave.  I think you should be worried that he will physically harm you.  I'd recommend contacting a domestic violence centre (as that is what you have been experiencing the last 10 years) and create a plan for leaving.

Even without a daughter, you should leave him so you dont have to live like this.  But your baby girl will be noticing this and it will affect her.  She will be happier and more secure being a daughter of divorced parents than living in this environment.  Good luck and stay safe.;;;Hey op. I grew up with a dad similar to your husband. Especially in the sudden yelling aspect whenever anything goes slightly wrong, or when you disagree with him.

Now I'm an adult and I honestly still need therapy. I moved out because of him. I ended up recently moving in with my boyfriend and I lied to him about it for a month because I can't bring myself to cut contact but I also don't want to be yelled at anymore.

Nothing scares me more than my dad drinking and yelling. I cry anytime anyone raises their voice at me. I grew up with a phobia of men that I'm still trying to get over. And even though he never hit me, its still a fear I grew up with, that he would. A fear that now makes me flinch if my boyfriend reaches up to touch my face or my hair too quickly.

I'm sure there are other reasons for my anxiety disorder too, but I know growing up with a dad like that made it so much worse.

I'm sure your husband loves your daughter, like I'm sure my dad loves me.

But him loving her or you doesn't fix the issues he has. And those issues do come out and hurt the people close to him. Please don't let his issues give your daughter life long ones.

I wouldn't want my childhood for any person. Please don't condemn your daughter to anything similar. ;;;Pulling you from a chair by the neck is physical, damage to the neck can kill you much more easily than elsewhere on the body.

Be honest with yourself. He's not going to stop yelling and being violent at home. Unless you divorce your daughter is going to have a traumatised and unsafe-feeling childhood. I really think you need a divorce, for your daughter's sake.

I also think that as he is lifting you from a chair by your neck in anger he will eventually do the same to your daughter. Remember that this can easily kill a child. I think you should go for sole custody and supervised visits only for the above reason.;;;Your daughter is already living in a broken home. Leave before she views violence as a normal part of a relationship.;;;Well anytime your unhappy with something such as a relationship you will probably just have to end it and move on. Life is way too short to stick around for people that arnt enjoyable. And most people just kinda suck overall. If your financially stable and can file a divorce it might be better for the kids. Its just awkward for um to be around grownups that dont get along. Its better for everyones mental health to just split before it just keeps dragging on. Why wait?;;;OP, your husband is a nightmare. It does not matter if he gets physical with you, just the screaming blowups are more than enough reason to leave. Your have neighbors knocking and offering their support - he must be so incredibly loud! Do you want your daughter to grow up thinking that she should find a man like him? Please just leave.;;;""his complete lack of empathy"" and ""He talks about himself and his accomplishments, plans and thoughts with great passion and for hours and hours. As long as someone will listen. (I listened for 10 years. We really talked about him almost exclusively for all this time.)

**tl;dr**: My husband and I have a six-month-old baby girl. I need to decide if a divorce is right or wrong for her well-being. What is better? This relationship or growing up with divorced parents, a potentially messy co-parenting situation or a single mama? I need help, I am completely lost, frightened and alone.

Let me start by telling you the good: My husband and I share values, interests and passions. We enjoy spending time together. I’m attracted to him. I admire his strength and drive. He makes me feel safe in the world. We share a history of 10 years. A lot of memories, a lot of good times. We built an amazing life together. Fulfilling careers, financial stability, a house we want to remodel, a community. We have lots of dreams for the future as a family and dreams beyond that time. He supports me. He wants me to succeed and he’ll do almost anything to make me happy. If I want to go somewhere or do something or need help with a something, he’ll make that thing his own and help, happily investing any amount of resources in whatever I need. He is incredibly generous to me and everyone else. We have loved becoming parents. He was incredibly supportive during my pregnancy and the delivery of our baby. He fell head over heals in love with his little baby girl. I can see his heart and soul light up when he sees her and holds her and tends to her. He has also been an incredible partner to me as a new mama. He has mostly taken my guidance how to parent our daughter, and has supported me in the ideas I have suggested. He has picked up work around the house to make sure I can use the baby’s nap times to work, and he has put finances in place to make sure her and I are safe no matter what happens to him.

And here is the bad and ugly:

I will remember the first incident clearly until the day I die. We had just started dating, we were in a state of complete bliss. We went out for a walk one night to just look at the stars and he said: Mexico is the biggest country by surface. And I said, all little girl, head-over-heals in love, admiring all of his knowledge and experience and strength and everything else about him: No. Mexico? Really? I said it in a tone of admiration, like, really? Tell me more. You are so smart, you know so much. And he flipped the lid. He screamed at me: What the fuck is wrong with you, you’re just like all the others, why does nobody believe me, why does everybody doubt what I say. I recognized pain that had nothing to do with me. So I stood still in complete shock for a second and then reached out to gently take his hand. He harshly slapped it away and stormed off. (He had been to a meeting earlier where he had expected to be offered a job, but hadn’t.) He came to my apartment the next day, smiled at me and hugged me, and never mentioned the incident again.

And here are recent incidents since our daughter was born:

He has a pond in the yard with fish in it. One morning he went outside, I was in the kitchen with the baby. I heard him scream: Noooooo! and he came storming into the kitchen and said, aggressively: Did you turn off the pond protection device?!?! All the fish are gone. I said very calmly, no I didn’t, retreating, afraid of what would come next. That can’t be he kept going, aggressively ranting, all the fish gone, all of them. Go outside and look. That can’t be, you must have turned it off. And then I remembered that I actually HAD turned it off and not back on the day before and I said: Oh wait. Shit! I DID turn it off. Oh no. And then he really turned it up. What is so hard about remembering to turn it back on, look at what you did, all the fish gone, what do you want to do now, how do you want to fix this. I quietly picked up the baby and left the room, saying please, not around the baby. He followed me around the house to keep, not screaming, but heatedly and aggressively blaming me and demanding answers and apologies while I kept saying, please, not around the baby. When I talked to him about this, he said that I misunderstood. Proof for this being a misunderstanding is that he didn’t care about the fish at all, and that I should have just answered his questions and that my walking away was aggressive and triggered him further.

The next one was a huge blowup just a few weeks later. I triggered him. I made the first mistake here. I know that. I asked him to get me a swaddle from the dryer while I put the baby to sleep and he left and didn’t come back and it was a stressful situation and I was mad, so I just stomped past him in the kitchen and got it myself. He did not deserve that. He didn’t. Hands! Down! He completely lost his shit. He screamed and yelled insults at me completely out of control as a result. I ran in the bedroom, quietly and quickly closed the doors and turned on the white noise machines and I pray to God that it was fast enough, that I'm mistaken and our baby didn’t yet understand. I came out of the bedroom when the baby was asleep and confronted him. Scared as shit, I said: Have you lost your mind? You have got to be kidding me. The baby heard that! I came into the room and she was wide-eyed, stiff as a board. And he lost it. He screamed like an animal. I asked for a conversation after that and he agreed. I very calmly told him that this can never ever happen again. That I cannot raise a baby in a broken home. That whatever we will do right will be worthless if we do this. I asked him to take anger management classes and go to therapy. What followed were the most horrible three weeks of my life. He could not admit wrongdoing. He said that my behavior had triggered him, that my passive aggression is worse than his active aggression, that I am influencing our child to see him as a predator. I tried to have conversations again and again, but he just told me I was the problem and ignored me aggressively. I had anxiety attacks during that time, waking up in the middle of the night with my heart racing. It got so bad that I just started shaking uncontrollably, cold sweat running down my body when he was around. I told him this and he said I should just stop shaking. I researched options to leave, looked at apartments and ways to divorce and co-parent. Then, one day, he kind of came around. He told me that I had been heard. That this will never happen again. The he gets that I will leave if it does. That he admired me for fighting so hard for our daughter. He could not agree to counseling or anger management because that meant putting a “broken” stamp on our relationship and he could not deal with that. It was quiet for a couple of months after that.

Then, last week, we were driving. He used the phone and the car’s navigation system to get directions, something is not working, he gets frustrated, impatiently dictates directions, gets lost and aggressively mutters What The Fuck. When we arrive and get out of the car, calm energy now, I calmly tell him that I think our baby picks up on this energy and that if it’s scary to me, I can only imagine how scary it is to her. He barks at me that that I should diffuse the situation and that me telling him this is aggressive and what he did wasn’t. I try again. I say that I’m not being aggressive, that I’m only asking and he says Fuck you, I’m not doing this and storms off. The next morning, I’m in the bathroom getting ready, grateful that he stayed a little later that morning so I have time to take a shower. Baby is with me on the bathroom floor, we’re playing with makeup brushes. Baby peed on the sheet and he wants to put a new sheet on the mattress. He asks where the sheets are and what I have been doing to protect the mattress and what he’s supposed to do now that the mattress is wet, put on a protector or no protector because the mattress needs a protector but if he puts it on now that it’s wet, the mattress will start molding. His questions and statements are aggressive and impatient. I tell him that his energy is scaring me. His reply: Just shut up and there won’t be anything scary here.

 I tried to talk to him twice after that. He got aggressive and defensive, started lying and twisting reality, tried to push all my buttons so he could turn this around and present ME as the aggressor, then threatened divorce if I continued to see him as a predator. I told him that I can’t do this anymore, that we need to go see a therapist. I begged. I asked him to please do this for our baby if he can’t do it for us. That I love him so much, that this is fixable, that it will be amazing to grow together and figure this out. He coldly asked me what happened if he didn’t agree, and I just quietly said that I can’t do this, that I would need to leave. And he said that I’ll have to leave then and he was done with the conversation. He aggressively ignored me and the baby for two days, then came back in the room, smiled, and expected for things to go back to normal.

For what happened in the 10 years between the first incident and these latest ones, I have no neat package. I have no understanding of what is actually going on. I only have fragmented thoughts, events and feelings.

When a conversation gets heated, I end up not knowing what’s up and what’s down. I don’t know how this happens. It has something to do with him twisting reality and getting into the Red Zone when I push a point that’s just true beyond doubt. When he realizes that there is no logical way other than admitting to a mistake, a line is crossed, and all bets are off.

When I make a mistake and apologize, to him, he doesn’t accept my apology. His response is basically that I should be feeling bad.

In the beginning, when I still fought back, I packed my bags a lot of times. He would always try to force me to stay when I was about to walk out the door. Once things got so heated, neighbors called the police. Our landlord’s son (we lived in the same apartment for 6 years before we moved to the house we now live in) once knocked on the door and said: I don’t know if things ever get physical, but you don’t need to be treated this way and we are here to help. Our other neighbor once said bluntly with both of us present: Listen, we know he beats you up. When we got back home after that, he said that this is what we get from my drama. That people think he beats me.

He got actually physical three times, but I have to say that I was never afraid that he would actually physically harm me. Two times he pinned me down on the bed. I don’t remember the ‘reason.’ Once, we had been working 48 hours straight on a project with a tight deadline. I said that I had to sleep for a few hours; that I had it under control, that I would meet the deadline even with a few hours of rest. He demanded I do one more thing because he didn’t agree with MY assessment for MY portion of the work that he knew a lot less about and than me and could not really assess. I said I could not go one minute longer, let alone complete what he wanted me to complete before going home, and he pulled me out of the chair by my neck and pinned me against the wall. We never talked about this after. My behavior had not brought this on. My tone in response to his demand that I keep working might have been defensive or cranky or even non-negotiable, but definitely in the reasonable realm.

One more thing that’s noticeable about him is a complete lack of empathy. I have never known anyone to respond to the pain they cause with such indifference.

His being late is almost comical. And by late I mean hours late because he just doesn’t care. (He says that himself: I don’t care. If I care, I’m on time.)

He talks about himself and his accomplishments, plans and thoughts with great passion and for hours and hours. As long as someone will listen. (I listened for 10 years. We really talked about him almost exclusively for all this time.) But the moment the person talks about themselves, his eyes glaze over, his energy shifts to disinterest, and he’ll very quickly start looking around the room or start playing with his phone. This is not true in conversations with people he respects or considers worthy of being liked by.

When I tell him something, anything, his first and only response is to dismiss and/or question it. This can be something simple, like: I think the trail will be muddy and his response, immediate and without thinking and weird because I know the trail and he doesn’t: Bullshit. Or joy: I open the oven and the cake I made turned out exactly like I wanted and I laugh and dance with joy and he walks in stonefaced and I try: Look, look, look, oh isn’t it amazing? And he says nothing and I try again: What do you think? And he says, well I don’t know I haven’t tried it yet.

He screams at service people on the phone or in person if they don’t give him what he wants. Even if they are right and he is completely in the wrong, like showing up at the gate for a flight when the gate has already closed.

It has always been clear to me that he understood on some level after an incident that what he did was wrong. He would, following an incident, always say what a terrible person he is. But never related to the incident. Just in a general, almost victim-like way. He would sometimes offer a blank apology, but when asked what he’s apologizing for, he would just say because you feel bad. When asked if that means he could have done something better, the answer is always no. 

He has problems with a lot of people he interacts with on a regular basis. He makes people cry at work, people keep telling him that he is abrasive and arrogant and hard to work with. He doesn’t really have any friends other than former love interests.

It sometimes feel that to him, he and I are the same person. It feels like he sees my accomplishments, in some way, as his own.

Let me end by saying that I’m a work in progress, too. I make a lot of mistakes. I tend to need space for myself. I can get annoyed which I know is so hurtful. When I’m stressed out, I get all flustered and overwhelmed. That’s bad and I know it, but I do own my stuff. When I make a mistake, I admit it. I apologize, I need to make things right to feel at peace with myself. And I work on it. I make sure I stay in a good space mentally, emotionally and spiritually, I seek advice, I try to grow. 

What do I do? A divorce? Is that better for my little girl? Growing up a child of divorced parents? Potentially a messy co-parenting situation in which I cannot protect her when she is with him? Or her growing up without a dad in her life? What is the right thing to do here?

Thank you so much for reading.",relationships,"Should I stay or should I go? Me [36F] with my husband [40M] 10 years together, 5 married."
t2_281f6t60,"Formerly overweight person here.  There's not much you can do to convince someone to take control of their health until they make that decision themselves.  I assure you she knows she's gained weight and that it's an issue, but for whatever reason she hasn't had the will to start changing her habits yet.  You can suggest healthier eating and exercise all you want but if she's not in the right mindset she'll find ways to continue her bad habits when you're not around.  It's probably not what you wanted to hear but she has to make the decision for herself.  You may not be willing to wait around for that day to come and I wouldn't blame you.;;;Fat person here. She knows she's fat. You've talked to her about her weight and given many reasons why she should lose weight, and she probably agrees with you that she needs to lose weight.

Losing weight is hard for a lot of people because it's got so  many emotional AND physical things that make it a problem. She still needs to eat to fuel her body, and figuring out the how and why to not eat more than your body needs sounds simple but putting it into action is pretty hard for a lot of people.

Going to the gym with your fit boyfriend who has lovingly explained he's worried about your health - that's probably just above poking her eye out with a rusty spoon on the lists of things she would like to do. 

I'm not fat-excusing, I'm just saying that...she knows she should lose weight. And she hasn't for a million reasons. Marrying you won't change her into someone who is suddenly able to do what it takes to lose weight.

You aren't going to be able to talk her into it, because she doesn't need convincing, she at this time does not feel like she can do it and she's probably tried a 1000 times to lose weight and has failed. She may find a way at some  point, but you aren't going to be the one who helps her.

Decide if you can live with a fat wife who may be everything in your dreams other than her body size. If you can't, there is zero shame in that. Physical appearance is really important and you won't be a monster for realizing that you will always want her to change. 

If you can't just let it go and understand that she knows very well she's fat, knows the health issues, and may very well never lose enough weight to  not be fat, then you need to let her go. You don't have to be cruel. But you don't want to spend your life wishing  the woman you married was different, and she doesn't want to spend her life never being good enough. ;;;Let me know when you figure it out. I'm in the same exact boat.  It's been almost 5 years and I feel like I've tried everything. Some people have an unhealthy relationship with food in the same way alcoholic does with booze. She's depressed by her weight, but delusional about fixing it. The worst is when she'll say she's tried to lose weight (diet/exercise) and it doesn't work. Recently she started talking about ""endomorphs"" because she took some dumb quiz online. She doesn't try. She puts effort in for like 1 or 2 weeks, starts backsliding, and then claims it's not working. You're not going to lose weight if you stock the cupboard with cookies and family packs of Reese's Cups, the freezer with ice cream, or if every time you're stressed you go McDonald's. Honestly, I'm at the end of the my rope. I've never said this out loud or even written it out before, but I've held off proposing for years because I'm afraid of spending my life taking care of an obese person. I love her so much and I'm fine with her being overweight, but obesity is a killer and morbid obesity is disgusting. ;;;It’s hard. I was the girl friend in this situation. I was 220 pounds when I met my husband, ballooned up to 316lbs by our first wedding anniversary. I wanted to change, I wanted to get healthy, but I just wasn’t in the right frame of mind. Nothing external really helped me, I just woke up one morning and decided to change. There is really nothing direct you can do to  motivate her. I would suggest coming up fun date ideas that don’t center around food, cook healthy at home, and try not to be pushy about the gym. Exercise is great, but not great for weight loss. It’s really hard to realize that you can’t fix someone. But she will need to want to do it for herself if she is going to change. If she expresses interest in weight loss you could recommend the lose it sub, it’s been an invaluable resource and support for me. People can change, I’m back down to 223 pounds as of today, and I’m on track to be a healthy weight by this time next year. But it is also ok to decide that you aren’t ok being with someone who isn’t ready to work on their health. I feel very lucky that my husband stuck by me through all my struggles, but it won’t make you a bad person to decide to leave the relationship.  ;;;There is nothing you can do except make good choices around her, and encourage the good choices she makes. She has to decide to lose weight on her own, and if she feels like you’re pressuring her it will do more harm than good. ;;;Have a talk with her and tell her that you are worried about her health. Make sure to tell her that your not complaining about how she looks. That you are definitely still attracted to her and that you love her and always will. It’s just that you want her to be the healthiest she can be so she will be around for a long long time. ;;;(1) Does your SO *want* to lose weight? If no, then there's nothing to be done. If yes, go to 2.

(2) Does your SO think she *can* lose the weight? This is the real crux of the matter. Most people who are fat *know* they are fat. And a lot of people who are fat want to be not fat.

The problem is that many fat people in this situation don't believe they're capable of losing the weight, and to a certain extent, they are correct. And it's not necessarily their fault; it's because of the rampant misinformation that people encounter at every turn about weight loss. In fact, despite not intending to, OP, you're helping to reinforce these misconceptions. You don't need to ever step inside a gym to lose weight; in fact, there are many fat people who go to the gym and work their asses off, don't lose weight, and become discouraged and give up. Why? Because they don't realize that the impact of exercise on calories burned is minimal (10-30% at most), and think that if they exercise a lot, they can eat however much they want as long as they burn it off. That's not how it works, though; eventually your body will conserve energy through NEAT to compensate for the extra exercise, meaning that you just break even.

If your girlfriend genuinely wants to lose the weight, she should be talking to a registered dietitian, and maybe a therapist.;;;On top of all of that, you may become less attracted to her over time and find it more difficult to be sexually aroused. You could spend a long time caring for her if she has health problems related to being overweight. If you want kids, I would not suggest having them with her, sorry for sounding like an ass.;;;If being healthy is important to you, then it should also be important to your partner. Not saying that they need to be a meathead or anything, but to me it’s similar to dating someone that isn’t in the same career boat as you. If you work hard for your career, wouldn’t you want someone that works just as hard? 

Being healthy is a conscious choice and it is NOT fair to you when you’re dating someone that doesn’t see that value (think CatDog and how cat took such good care of himself and Dog got all the benefits). 

I definitely don’t think you’re being critical or shallow and if that’s how she would interpret that, I think you have a bigger problem. My suggestions would include: only eat healthy around her and if she wants junk-I’d indirectly shame the junk ie “oh I can’t afford to eat that today, or I don’t need it”. You have the ability to make a conscious effort of what is good for you and what isn’t, she probably doesn’t have that. So making it verbal will probably make her think “oh ya maybe this isn’t the right choice” also if you cook together, only make things surrounded by lean meats and veggies and nothing fried. When you start to gradually change your diet, you can feel how bad you felt with a bad diet. 

In regards to exercise, there’s multiple techniques. You can try the “it’s healthy” method, which doesn’t work. There’s the reverse psychology method of “you don’t need it”. There’s the “don’t you like that I look good, don’t u want the same for me” and there’s also the change your mindset “think of it as an hour a day just for you, and let it be fun”. Find reasons why you enjoy being active and relate it to her. 

If she doesn’t change her habits, I genuinely don’t see how your relationship will succeed. It’s plain and simple: you don’t have the same values, you take your health seriously and she doesn’t. If she can’t see that then you deserve better. ;;;God, some of the comments on this thread are outright horrendous. ;;;She's doing that to herself. You seem very supportive of her and yet she still seems to refuse to see the issue. Honestly, if I were you, I would probably break up with her. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh and horrible, but I think being healthy is important and even more important than that is to see that the person you're considering to spend the rest of your life with does care about their health as well. That is a major red flag to me because it just means that they doesn't care about themselves at all. 

I don't mean to sound rude or anything, I just mean that someone like that would be completely incompatible with me and would immediately put me off.

I honestly hope both of you can work something out for that but if you don't and end up breaking up over that, I would definitely say you're not being shallow. ;;;Kids often follow the parents example. If she doesn’t know how to eat right, her kids likely aren’t going to learn to eat right. 


Going from no activity to going to the gym is a big leap. Can you instead just suggest walking in a park on a flat trail? Or buying an elipictal and stepping during commercials of a show?


What’s a 5-10 minute active thing to do? People generally can be convinced to do something for 5 mins.


As for eating, what’s one small change? Can she cut out drinks other than water for 1 week? Substitute chips for carrot sticks? One dinner a week that’s veggie? One day a week of no junk food?


Find a manageable increment rather than an overwhelming lifestyle overhaul. And do this change together. 


;;;&gt;What am I supposed to do? 

You gotta move on.  She knows diabetes is bad (I mean, who has it that doesn't know?).  You've encouraged her to become more active, but she's stuck in this.  Marriage won't be about feelings, it's also about compatible lives, and yours are diverging.  Just gotta rip that band-aid off.;;;Are there any underlying health or emotional issues that could be causing her obesity? Is she depressed?

At the end of the day you just have to tell her exactly how you feel. ""I love you with all my heart, but I have concerns about your weight because of the health issues and pregnancy issues..."" It's going to hurt her feelings but this is an important conversation to have if you want to actually have a lot of happy years with her in the future.;;;So I have some experience in this situation. My father is overweight and I have developed incredible anxiety about It, I am constantly worried about his health. I try to compare my dads weight and eating habits to living with a drug addict. It’s the same emotional rollercoaster. Just like living with a drug addict, I can tell you there’s really nothing YOU can directly do to get her to lose weight and fix her problem. That all lies in the hands of her. She needs to see the problem herself and address It. Possibly, like my father, she may have an underlying problem: depression, which is a HUGE contributor to being overweight (in some cases), so consider that. What we did for my father was stage an intervention, i understand It is uncomfortable and can make everyone feel bad an awkward but I’m telling you It might open her eyes and see how It is not only affecting her health and well-being but how it’s affecting her loved ones including you: the one who wants to eventually marry and start a family with. Tell her you have her back through the weight lose process and that you can help her possibly start therapy (if depressed) she might feel better knowing she has someone by her side fully committed to helping her and that she won’t feel alone. ;;;You’ve got 3 options:
- don’t say anything and break up 
- don’t say anything and stay together, unhappy
- say something, and you might break up OR she might change her lifestyle and then you get everything you want!

I know it’s not that simple, but if the love of my life was reconsidering a future with me because of my weight, I’d want to know so I could do something about it. 

It’s gonna hurt her, no matter how kindly you say it, so just be kind and direct. Tell her you love her and want to start your lives together, but her weight is holding you back. 

I wouldn’t get into why, just say you’ve realised it’s really important to be with someone who’s not significantly overweight.

Tell her you’ll support her and help her any way you can, but also tell her you’d understand if this is not something she’s willing or able to do- your dealbreaker might be a dealbreaker for *her*, for all sorts of reasons. 

Expect her to be hurt, defensive and angry at first. Try not to get swept up in that- this is a mega sensitive issue, particularly for women, and it’s not something many of us could take calmly in our stride. Maybe suggest she gives it a day or two to think it over and then talk about it when she’s feeling calm and gathered her thoughts. 

My only caveat is that if you want her to get thinner than she was when you got together, you shouldn’t have got together with her in the first place, and you should let her go. ;;;As an officially overweight person who tracks that they eat and spends at least 5hrs a week doing cardio, I personally wouldn't see any kind of future with someone who's lifestyle is what you've described.

If it was me, truthfully, I'd break up and take some time to heal before I started dating again, and vet the people I'm dating for long term potential in a way that it doesn't sound like you ever did with this girl. I personally wouldn't bother with an ultimatum, because she's made her position really clear and it would just be trying to force something that ultimately can't be forced.;;;I started a meal prep service for my meals. They send me the already cooked meals every 2 weeks and I just have to microwave them. They’re delicious and healthy. Each meal is 250-400 calories. I also do sporadic cardio (not consistent at all). I’ve lost 21 pounds since January which for me is huge. I’ve always struggled with losing weight. Now my clothes are fitting way better and I’m motivated to lose 20-30 more. 

I’m only mentioning this because a meal service like that may help her. She doesn’t have to think and the meals really helped me learn portion control. I definitely don’t hardcore work out. Just eat right. ;;;Get her to be active with you, and talk to her about how you feel. My boyfriend is overweight and we talk about health goals and work on eating healthy together. Between starting birth control, winter, and being happy with my man I’ve put on 20lbs and am anxious to get rid of it again this summer. 
Something key here though is going to be how affectionate you are with her and your sex life. If you have a dead bedroom the talk will go over like a lead balloon. She needs to know that attraction is definitely not the issue.;;;Every time you bring this subject up you'll be inviting her to feel shame.  If she is emotionally eating, that definitely trigger it.  I would not even invite her to the gym.  All that stuff you are doing will cause resentment.   If she is emotionally eating, counselling will help alot there.  Sounds like she is steadily expanding so something seems up for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to bring up something you said at the end of your post here.

&amp;#x200B;

"" I don't know what to say to her because I'm afraid of her thinking I'm shallow"".   Something sounds strange there.  When I think about how I'd fare myself in this place, the reason I wouldn't want to say it is because I dont want to hurt the other persons feelings.  If you are only concerned about how you LOOK, then that kind of is a shallow way of thinking...isnt it.  This is about appearances. No criticism intended at all, Just thought you might like awareness... maybe what you meant to say was just lost in translation somehow.  ;;;Has she had her thyroid tested? Are medical issues ruled out as a reason for her weight gain? 

Weight is a tough topic. I would try to talk to her about it as if you want to get healthy with her, so she doesn't feel attacked. Maybe be like ""I want to join a gym, but don't want to go alone. Will you come with me? We can both get helathier together"". Or something like that. 

If she doesn't respond to that, then it might be time to say ""I love you, and I'm saying this *because* I love you. It's really important for you to eat right and exercise when you have diabetes. I want you to live a long time. Please consider joining me at the gym. We can do this together."" 

You could also try encouraging her to see a dietican, because it can be really overwhelming to try to lose weight if you have no idea how to. 



But ultimately, it's her choice. ;;;You have two problems, wanting to live a healthy lifestyle that includes her and spiraling on concerns that aren't yours yet (as a doctor, you know fertility is way more complicated than that). Something small could be to pick up healthy cooking as a hobby. People are much more open to passively changing their habits when it doesn't require that much effort on their part and it involves eating just as delicious food. Especially if you're not like following any specific diet, more like ""oh hey i'm really getting into stir-frying vegetables..."" Farm share box subscriptions are a good way to get a shitload of random produce that you have to find something to do with. If she really is diabetic, I can take you at your word that you are concerned about her health, but again, as a doctor, you know it's way more complicated than that. In her case, hating the gym is kind of a problem. It's just a question of if it is your problem. Maybe following the same hobby idea, maybe she does hate working out, but that doesn't mean she would hate rock climbing or hiking or yoga or some kind of dance thing. Be open, try to have fun. If you really aren't having attraction issues (which is fine, just a different problem than you say you have), you shouldn't be twisting yourself into knots over her hypothetical health. You should be finding ways that you can have a compatible lifestyle together. There's a reason that doctors are not supposed to treat their loved ones. It gets all kinds of weird stuff in your head. You can however let her know that you will do whatever you can to support her in doing whatever her doctor recommends to control her diabetes. Just make sure you know that if she ever has any questions or needs help, you won't act like her doctor, you will act like her boyfriend who happens to know what those words mean..;;;My husband loved and supported me all the way from 120 to 200 and back again. He’s never said anything about my weight and only ever told me I’m beautiful. If he hadn’t showed such unflagging love and support I don’t think I’d have had the strength to lose the weight and get my health back. Also - keto. ;;;Welp...you’re fucked.  

If you stay and just go along to preserve her feelings, she will most likely stay on her current path.  This may mean she dies young leaving you with children if she can even stay pregnant.  She will grow larger, have less energy than today, embarrass you at public events (don’t even begin to say we wouldn’t be embarrassed by an obese partner) and frankly leave you in the role of sole bread winner, parent and home maker.  You’ll live a life of servitude to her illnesses and health. 


If you leave your a bad guy and too shallow.  ;;;I'd have one of these solemn conversations:


You: ""Look, I want a future with you""

Her: ""We can, we've talked about getting married""

You: ""No, I want a lasting future with you. One that won't exist if you continue gaining the weight you are. I'm worried about you""


Edit: in other words.. make it real to her that she's going to die.;;;You've seen zero improvement in 3 years.  In fact, it's gotten much worse.

You know this person is only going to get fatter and die young.  Just cut your losses;;;i'm gonna tell you a story: my BF used to tell me...well, not that i was fat, but tell me how to get into better shape. (my current BMI is 20.4, i used to be an athlete. not anymore, but i've never been overweight). he's right, i could have been doing more, but because it was coming from him i felt judged.  Fast forward to now. I go to the gym, lost the unnecessary weight (like...5 pounds, lol), eating better, BUT i did it to help control a medical condition that has the potential to be physically crippling and damaging to fertility and pregnancy. 

&amp;#x200B;

you can express your concerns in a loving way that focuses on health instead of vanity, but ultimately you can't make healthy changes for her. she has to do it for herself and find her reason to get healthy.  maybe having a third party physician with no stake in your relationship talk to her about the reality of her situation will help. there may be depression and unresolved psychological issues getting in her way. there's no way around it, this talk is probably going to hurt her feelings, but it's important. ;;;just an FYI, there's tons of articles available abt the medical abuse/neglect of fat ppl, so I think you might wanna check urself and how you're thinking about her. you're coming from an environment that is not good to fat ppl, so be careful that you're not projecting onto her. ;;;There is nothing you can do to change someone's habits, especially considering the constant discipline to lose weight and stay fit. It's not unreasonable to worry about her health, or limited activities or even attraction.  Is it a deal breaker? Because more likely than not, the weight gain will continue.;;;You seem to be conflating two fairly separate things here: weight and health. If you are actually worried about her health then you should focus your efforts there and drop any mentions of weight. 

The problem when you mix the two together is people start out by changing their diets and adding exercise, then don't lose weight and give up the whole endeavor. 

Being more physically active will improve her overall health, help her diabetes and lower her risk of pregnancy complications regardless of whether or not she ends up losing weight.;;;",1553880126.0,b70172,t3_b70172,98,30,/r/relationships/comments/b70172/i_28m_dont_know_how_to_feel_about_my_girlfriend/,"My girlfriend was overweight when I met her and has continued to slowly gain weight over the three years we've been dating. I will love her no matter how much weight she gains, and her face is still cute, but as a resident doctor, I worry about her health. We're both open to getting married at some point in the next couple years and I worry about her health deteriorating in the future, especially since she is already diabetic. If we decide to have children or something, she would most likely have complications during her pregnancy she otherwise wouldn't experience if she were of a healthy weight. And I'm scared of getting heart broken if she has other health problems that would cause her to die an early death. It's not like I'm being hypocritical, either. I swim 5 times a week and I'm definitely not overweight. I've asked her to go to the gym with me sometimes, but she always says she doesn't want to. I don't know what to say to her because I'm afraid of her thinking I'm shallow or something when I just care about her health. What am I supposed to do?

tl;dr: my girlfriend is overweight and I'm nervous about her health. I don't know what to do",relationships,I [28M] don't know how to feel about my girlfriend [27F] gaining weight
t2_gc52lro,"Hey, there. This is something I can relate to, and maybe help with. I'm 45M, and I've also Been There ^TM. Here's the tl;dr:

* You'll never have the *same* kind of relationships, as an adult, that you did during your younger years. I don't mean *at all* that you'll never have great relationships -- you will! -- but it will help you right now if you accept that these relationships *will be different*, in texture, in intensity, and in number.
* No one actually wants to be ""friends"" as an adult. (Well, mostly not. There are exceptions.) That's something that you have to build toward, and it takes time, and there are no shortcuts.
* It takes work. But once you figure out how to do the work, it's actually fairly joyful work.
* Try to set aside your own self-perception of being ""shy"" or ""introverted"". These labels aren't really useful. Usually, what this really means is that you don't enjoy some of the most common or prominent that ways people relate to each other. But you wouldn't be here if you weren't looking for some kind of overt connection. So instead of thinking of yourself as ""shy"", I would encourage you to re-think of yourself as ""not skilled in navigating certain social situations"". Skills can be developed. When you think of yourself as ""shy"", you put an inescapable, immutable label on yourself; it prevents growth.

Making friends in college is basically life on easy mode. You're all the same age, very few people have major relationships, no one has kids, you're thrown together for 30 hours a week in classrooms, cafeterias, labs, etc. It's almost impossible *not* to make friends. And I don't say that to disparage you -- like I said, I've been there! -- and I realize that right now it *does* feel hard to make friends, and I want to offer my empathy on that.

What I'm getting at is that, up until now, you haven't had to consciously think about what goes into creating a new friendship. It's so easy to think of it as ""I met this new person and we *like each other so much!*"" and then you're basically done, except for scheduling awesome activities. 

Weirdly enough, that's not really how things usually work. In my experience, here are the main things that help create and nurture a new friendship:

* Repeated contact. Ideally, *something* puts you two together, time after time. Like going to class, right? As an adult, if you have to schedule *every* interaction between you and your New Person, then one or both of you is going to get exhausted by this work, and the frequency will drop off at some point. And then you'll both go ""oh, she doesn't want to hang out with me"" and then it will drop off to nothing. And neither of you will know why. So: Find some *reason* to keep getting together. This is why people get into classes, sports, dancing lessons, yoga, movie clubs, etc. The environment *gives* you structure, and even though we *think* of structure as the antithesis of natural, fluid socializing, it's actually enormously beneficial. Imagine you've been going to a yoga class for three months, and you've *kinda* gotten to know 3 women; you talk before and after the class. One week you can't make it, so you skip. The next week you're back, and you were *missed* -- people remark on how you were gone, and now you're back, yay!
* A *lack* of high-intensity expectations. If you meet someone new, and you both like each other, it's really common to blast them with intense feelings of ""I LIKE YOU -- LET'S BE BEST FRIENDS FOREVER NOW -- OK -- READY SET GO"". I think this can have the opposite effect of what you want, *even* when the other person wants roughly the same thing. These intense feelings inevitably create expectations, and (in both people) the fear of disappointment of those expectations. So: Try to build new relationships with a *minimum* of expectations, and (as above) with a lot of repeated contact. It will become obvious who wants a more intense friendship with you, and who wants to just remain an acquaintance.
* Nurture your acquaintances, even if you don't expect them to become close friendships. Reason #1: You may meet someone else through an acquaintance who *does* become important to you. I know one guy who is a ""super-node"" -- someone who knows EVERYBODY. He's an OK guy, and we'll never be more than acquaintances to each other, but through him I've met some really great people. There's nothing wrong with this -- I'm not ""using"" him or anything negative. If anything, I'm making his already-large network of friends even larger and even more close-knit, by forming relationships with other people that he knows.
* Think about what you can contribute to other people's lives. It's really easy to just think about what you want from a friendship. But what can you give to someone else? Can you make up a schedule for Movie Night, find out what people like to watch, and be the one who is hosting Movie Night? Can you organize a museum trip? This is work, and sometimes it will not be appreciated *but sometimes it will be*. People who take the initiative to set up social situations are taking risks, and are generally reaping the rewards, too. Find ways that you can be that person.
* Keep moving forward. Accept that old approaches are no longer the best fit to your new stage in life. Also, I found socializing in my late 20s to be rather frustrating, but oddly enough my 30s (and even my 40s) have been positively *filled* with opportunities. But I had to figure this out -- that I had to learn new habits, find new ways to meet people, and new ways to appreciate them. None of them felt the same as in my early 20s, and I missed that for a long time. Also, if an existing friendship of yours isn't working and you can't find a way to fix it -- mourn the end of that relationship (or that phase of that relationship), but then move on.

Ok, this is turning into a novel. Sorry not sorry. Long story short, I *strongly* encourage you to find activities that give you regular, scheduled reasons to interact with people. Art classes. Softball. Movie clubs. Cookbook clubs. Wine &amp; truffles club. Yoga class. Weight-lifting class. (Seriously, lots of women have had great experiences learning to lift weights and meeting other women that way.) Volleyball. Sailing classes. Mountaineering / hiking.

A huge, crucial part of this is finding ways that you can be valuable or useful to other people. Lots of club / team activities have this flavor, where *you being there* means that someone *else* has a better experience. It's addictive, for everyone concerned.
;;;Oh man, I feel this.  Making friends as an adult is SO HARD.  Honestly, if you're religious, I'd give church a try.  It's not my thing, but sometimes I wish it was because I know lots of people who have made great friends that way.  It seems that the key is joining a Sunday School class or ""Small Group,"" so that you get to spend time with a smaller, more accessible group of people in a more informal setting.

Good luck!;;;&gt;I tried going to a meet-up for a hobby I was interested in, and ended up having a not great time because everyone at this meet-up had already met at previous meet-ups and were already close. So I felt like the odd-one out. 

This is pretty standard, you were literally the odd one out. It usually takes attending a few times for both them to warm up to you and for you to warm up to them. And that's normal and natural. Think of it like the first day of a job, no body knows what to think of you and you don't know what to think of anyone, but slowly you figure it out and they get used to you and it's a comfortable and familiar situation.

And don't be afraid of failure. When you meet people, and get to know them, they won't always be available when you are and vice versa. If you make some friends at church or from your hobby, and you invite them to do something, and they turn you down, don't give up, try and try again. You'll get there, and you'll make some good friends, it just takes putting yourself out there and investing in the friendships.;;;Try Bumble BFF! Literally met my best friend off there. ;;;So I just went to a poly meetup and they must be some of the best people in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also very intraverted, but one of the members at the meetup saw me sitting there looking awkward, like I do, came up and asked me directly, are you shy? She said, you seem shy.

&amp;#x200B;

Sucked me right in to the group.

&amp;#x200B;

These people are awesome.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know that not everyone is into poly, but meetup is a really good resource for meeting people. What are your interests?;;;When I graduated from college making friends was *so* hard. I’m also an introvert. Honestly it took me six months to almost a year before I really started to meet people and make friends. But the good news is that i did make some good friends and as the years have gone by we’ve gotten pretty close. You can have that too!

I know that you’re introverted but if you want to make friends you’re really going to have to push yourself out of your comfort zone a little bit. That means going places where there’s people to meet. 

You said that you went to a meetup for your hobby but didn’t really meet anyone. What happened at those meetings? How many meetings did you go to before you stopped? Did you approach people and start conversations or did you wait for them to approach you? Did you ask for anyone’s number or did you wait for them to ask you for yours?

Have you tried any other meetup groups? There’s also a chance that you ran into a crowd that just wasn’t super welcoming, but that’s not a guarantee that other meetup groups will be the same! Board game groups and book club groups are great places to meet people, and it’s pretty easy to start conversations because you can always talk about the board game or book. 

If you’re religious than finding a church home is another great way to find friends. Try to get involved with a bible study/small group, that would probably be the quickest way to meet people. 

Another way to meet people is to take a class or to volunteer with an organization/cause that you’re passionate about. 
;;;We're in pretty much the same situation. I lost all my friends years back and now I'm finding it hard to connect with people. I keep being told to put myself out there to find people to befriend and not just hobby groups but also voluntary stuff.

I'm sorry I haven't got better advice. ;;;Try volunteering in the local area;;;",1553889564.0,b71xf7,t3_b71xf7,10,8,/r/relationships/comments/b71xf7/i_29f_cant_seem_to_make_long_term_friendships/,"So kind of looking for advice here.

I'm a pretty introverted individual. I mostly enjoy keeping to myself but then occasionally get lonely.

Because I tend to keep to myself, since I graduated college, I don't keep relationships up with people. My best friend \[31F\] moved far away from me for work so we don't get to hang out anymore. We don't text much anymore either. I'm usually the person that reaches out and initiates conversations with her but I'm a little exhausted having to do that all the time. When I was in college, it was easy to meet people. Classes, sitting in the student center, hanging in the green, but...now that I've graduated, I'm stuck in this routine of waking up, going to work, coming home. And it's all I do. I don't have any girlfriends to hang out with after work, or get coffee or go shopping with on the weekends. Nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried going to a meet-up for a hobby I was interested in, and ended up having a not great time because everyone at this meet-up had already met at previous meet-ups and were already close. So I felt like the odd-one out. So of course I didn't get any numbers from anyone or any requests to hang out again another time. I've considered going back to Church as a way to meet people. I'm a religious person but haven't gone in a while... 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway. I just don't know what to do. Do you have any suggestions for a shy, fairly young adult looking to make life long friends after college?

t2_3hzqdtga,"&gt;Mark's child was just diagnosed with a terminal illness. Now Ryan and I are both too good of people to add on this extra stresser to his wife's life. Apparently, his whole family is completely blindsided by the son's illness and have been extremely invested in his plan of care

How do you know this is true?  Has the child's illness been verified by someone other than Mark?  You already know Mark is a liar-liar-pants-on-fire.  If he'll lie about currently having an affair with you, why wouldn't he lie about a sick child?  

;;;I would be very concerned that Mark is married with a newborn and spreading rumors about *himself* having an affair with *you.* That's the behavior of a madman who feels he has nothing to lose.

Do your best to have as little contact with him as possible. Be pleasant, but not inviting. In any other scenario, I would say you should also tell his wife because she deserves to make her own decisions about whether or not she wants to be with and raise a child with a cheater. However, this is your career. The drama of another family is not worth risking your job over. It would be in your best interest to lay low.

If Mark continues to make problems for you at work, document everything emails, texts, etc. and take it to HR. However, nepotism makes this a tricky situation. Bringing down the CEO's son will more than likely be an impossible battle for you to win. That said, if it gets to this point, you should also prepare to look for a new job.

Additionally, continue working on your transparency with Ryan. You don't need to protect and lie for assholes like Mark. Protect your relationship.;;;I understand the complications of telling your SO that you hooked up with one of his friends cut that being said, you shouldn’t have lied to him &amp; you should have been honest from the jump. 

That being said I think you’re both on the right path. Ignoring Mark seems like the best approach. I would suggest you threaten him with exposure if he doesn’t stop spreading rumors about you and personal videos of you. The combined threat of him loosing his family plus possible jail time should knock some sense into him (hopefully)?;;;OP, since this may possibly veer into legal issues, I would also try crossposting to /r/legaladvice and rephrasing certain parts of this post to include a more legal perspective (i.e. how can I defend myself legally if so-and-so happens, what legal steps should I take to prepare for this, what staff do I need to speak to if this happens, is it too late to do this). 

Please be careful and keep your head down. Mark is really really bad news. You may also have to consider leaving your job if it looks too dangerous (because Mark is the CEO's son). ;;;Snubbing him is the right thing to do. That he has time for such foolishness when his son is dying is unbelievable.

;;;Wow, I'm impressed your dude stayed.;;;I would demand he delete it. He has more to lose in this than you, not sure why he would push it? ;;;Man, I wish I could give Ryan a hug. Poor guy, doesn’t deserve any of this. 

Not only did his new gf hook up with the CEO’s son (a red flag in itself), but all his friends in that room know that his new gf has “been around” and have seen the videos. I can only imagine how embarrassed Ryan would feel if OP and him run into one of their colleagues again out in the streets. 

And to top it off, Ryan has to deal with a gf who lies and has hooked up with a married man (OP should’ve done her due diligence beforehand to know who she would be getting intimate with). I feel for him!

OP, please let Ryan go so he can find his true soulmate and someone who deserves him. For his sake. ;;;",1553899371.0,b73sg6,t3_b73sg6,14,8,/r/relationships/comments/b73sg6/a_former_fling_26m_is_spreading_lies_that_hes/,"Let's call the fling Mark, my current boyfriend Ryan (29M). I apologize if this is coming off as erratic- I'm quite upset and super angry :(

&amp;#x200B;

Mark's father is the CEO of a very big company. This company employs has about 20,000 employees. When I graduated with my masters, and got a job with this company, I felt everything I had worked so hard to achieve was finally coming together. I was SO proud that I had earned this job- I'm very attached to it, and I'm totally killing it. I've gotten promoted twice in the past year. The salary and benefits are amazing, and I love my coworkers with all my heart

&amp;#x200B;

October 2018: I met Mark when he and I ended up on the same team. Mark has a very common last name, so I had no idea he was the son of the CEO. We quickly hit it off, and began emailing flirtatiously. A few days later, he ended up being transferred to another team. However, he added me on SnapChat, the chemistry between us intensified, and we eventually agreed to hook up after work

&amp;#x200B;

He pulled up in a very expensive car, and we ended up hooking up in it. By hooking up, I mean we had oral sex multiple times that night. We continued to flirt whenever we ran into each other, and then had oral sex again a couple of weeks later in his car again. At the end of this second and last encounter, he mentioned how next time, we would go to a hotel. I didn't think much of this at the time; I assumed because it was after work, and we had work the next day, we were doing it in the car so we could go home at a reasonable time

&amp;#x200B;

November 2018: Now- I'm not big into social media at all, but I was a bit awestruck by Mark. I decided to look him up on social media finally, and was completely interested in pursuing him. And there it was: he was the son of the CEO. He was also married and had a newborn.

&amp;#x200B;

To say I was livid is a severe understatement. At the same time, he stopped reaching out to me, and I thought the whole thing was just a rare case of running into a total douchebag and womanizer. I thought it was over.

&amp;#x200B;

I met Ryan a couple of weeks later at a work mixer. Ryan is the sweetest, most gentle soul I've ever come across. He's intelligent, handsome, a great conversationalist. We began dating exclusively in January 2019, and have been together since. Our work has a very strict policy on coworkers dating, so I asked Ryan if we could just keep it secret for now. He's going to be moving to a different company literally next month, so we'll just move into the public eye then. Ryan had asked me if I had ever dated anyone in the company before, but I honestly didn't want to ruin Mark's life or rehash that unpleasant experience, so I stupidly said no...

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago, I went to one of Ryan's indoor soccer matches to cheer him on. It turns out Mark (!!) is on the same team, and they're also friends (!!!). It shocked me, although it shouldn't have considering Mark and Ryan and I all work together. I just hadn't heard Ryan ever mention Mark, but there they were cracking inside jokes and laughing. When Mark saw me and Ryan, he had shock written all over his face. After I drove off, apparently Mark cornered Ryan and asked him if we were together. Ryan said no, and Mark seemed relieved.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, Ryan noticed. When he got home, he interrogated me. I said I had no idea why Mark seemed relieved, and that we worked together in the past. Topic was over-- but not really.

&amp;#x200B;

This past Saturday, Ryan called me at 2 AM asking me to be truthful, and he was crying, and super upset. We decided to meet the following morning so we could speak. I felt like Mark had done something, but I wasn't sure what.

&amp;#x200B;

Short story: turns out they were an all dude party together, and Mark told everyone he and I were carrying out an affair since October. Of course, they're all men and no one's going to snitch on anyone. A few of the guys there are also legit having affairs with other women. Mark told everyone that apparently I've been sleeping with him for months and am in love with him. He had recorded some snaps I sent him during that initial time we had some chemistry between us, and showed everyone. Ryan got super emotional at this part, and told me that had he been in the room when he was showing the videos, he would have killed him. I told Ryan that OK, Mark and I had hooked up in his car, but that we had not slept together, and that we certainly were not having an affair. I explained that I had no idea that he was married and had a child. We were both in tears

&amp;#x200B;

Ryan nodded solemnly and told me he believed me. We're together practically every minute, and between Ryan and work, I literally have no time to carry out a full fledged affair. I told Ryan that I feel that my body and privacy have been violated, and I wanted to go to the police. Ryan told me he would have gone with me, and completely supports me except...Mark's child was just diagnosed with a terminal illness. Now Ryan and I are both too good of people to add on this extra stresser to his wife's life. Apparently, his whole family is completely blindsided by the son's illness and have been extremely invested in his plan of care

&amp;#x200B;

So, what we ended up doing is blocking Mark on everything. He noticed immediately and tried to confront us. Ryan and I are treating him as if he's air; not paying him any attention. And it's noticeably killing him

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what else to do. Should I bring this up to my work? Will it impact my job? Should I demand he delete every image/video he has of me? I'm just not really sure what to do here

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you and please let me know if I can clarify anything. I feel so sick to my stomach, I can't even think straight

You need to look after your own needs.  Move out.;;;How old are you and do you live with your parents as well?;;;Not sure how much you can do to help your parents out, but as far as you, you say she gambled away your money?? Don't give her a penny of your money, let her have all the fits she wants.;;;yes. I had a brother just like this-it went on until he stole $300,000 from my elderly mom and she was left in dire straits and I had to come in and rescue her. I told her many times over 20 years what was happening but she lacked the will to seat for herself or deal with it.

Your parents know what she is like. They lack the will to do anything about it. She is not going to change bc she is getting her way. The best thing you can does focus on being able to move out soon so you dont have to witness it-and keep all your stuff locked up.

Your parents could give her a set of house rules:

1) get a job and pay back the money you stole within 3 months or move out

2) the next time you seal you will have to leave

3) The next time there is a dirty nappy out you will have to move out

4) You must do chores 1, 2 , 3 and 4 on a daily basis or you will have to move out

5) you need to get a job and pay x amount a week for room and board

and so on.

But your parents either won't even take this first step or won't follow through.

BTDT;;;Move out and distance yourself;;;Your situation certainly makes the Victorian ability to get someone committed (usually women) on the say so of two people, not even doctors, seem like a great idea. 

And of course I don't mean it, it was a ghastly, misogynistic, criminal law.

Can you call child protective services (or the children's protective charity) and ask for advice? They might not be able to do much but they could point you in the direction of some helpful resources or offer some useful methods to deal with her. 

Personally, if I was your parents, I'd kick her out and take her to court for custody of the kid. She's not a fit parent and she's a pain to live with.

 Tonight she opened my mums gift and ate a large part of it.... When pulled up about it she managed to redirect the conversation into how dare someone found the rubbish and put it by her door, and try at make it out that I had somehow planned this to get her in trouble. Seems easy to argue right?  nope, not when you scream, burst into tears. My parents know its not true of course  but literally have no idea what to do but reiterate the point they were trying to make which leads to a feedback loop until one of them is too tired of the cycle and leaves or gives up. 

I mentioned money and gold before which In the grand scheme of things makes chocolate inconsequential but  the argument is exactly the same no matter what. Hell she gambled 565 dollars of my own money in app purchases, to which I have to push to a point of argument to get a small payment back after a year. Its shit, maybe 1-3 times a week, Food, dirty nappies being left around, money, asking to help with the dishes etc, literally becomes a point of contentment to the point of one-sided screaming, crying and frankly manipulation 

Like all people like this, when she is good she is good but its getting really painful around here. I need to move out but I just started graduate studies  (not really an excuse it needs to happen just  got get the money). 

The obvious answers…. kick her (or I leave but thats still leave my parents in a shitshow ) or get her therapy. BUT. HOW. what happens to her son. my parents don't know I am writing this, but they are literally at wits ends with her.

Edit: Sorry if this isn't entirely correct. What is and isn't true about your nationality isn't very clear! ;;;I wouldn't open with humour, but hopefully he'll see the humour in it. It's like a Seinfeld plot.

Tell him what you've said here (maybe leave out the part about not being interested in him at first!) and apologise for not 'fessing up sooner. You know this isn't normal behaviour and you're super embarrassed for letting it get to this point.

Unless he's super uptight, he'll get over it.

FWIW, I think quite a lot of people have experience with a dumb lie getting out of control. As long as you're not habitually untruthful or crazy, it's not the end of the world.;;;I think you should just be honest with him just like you were with us... Be apologetic &amp; a little bit vulnerable; you can explain it exactly as you did here. You've been together for five years, so I'm hoping he'll understand why you kept up the charade early on. ;;;Ummm yeah just try to make it funny but then don’t go too much into details. ;;;Come clean and hope for the best. It may not.

The obvious problem is that you've had five years to correct your error in judgment. Five years. The problem with a lie is that one has to maintain it, and you've kept building on that fiction, incorporating it into the identity he knows. Instead of correcting that understanding you stretched it out, and let's be realistic here, you'd continue to keep up the pretense if the wedding wasn't a thing. That's a problem.

There's a common saying out there, *being sorry for being caught isn't being sorry*, paraphrased but near enough. You're only worried about this because it's about to come out, not because you've been untruthful to your partner full stop. Unless you ditch that mindset and attempt to establish things on a surer foundation with him it's a questionable future ahead.


;;;I don't think it's that big of a deal since you were born one place but grew up in the other. Just tell him that to clarify you're from B but grew up in A. ;;;Does he even remember that you told him? I mean, I've dated people who couldn't remember something fairly significant after a few months, let alone 5 years.;;;Be honest, try to make him see the humour in it. He might not think it's funny right away, but I think most people can eventually come to see the humour in ""I didn't know what else to do, so I doubled down on my mistake for 5 years"". 

When you tell him, though, I wouldn't say that you lied because you didn't like him, unless he already knows that you weren't sold on him at the first date. Tell him you panicked, or you don't know why you said it. ;;;This has me cracking up! Thank you so much for posting. 

As a guy I would love if my fiancé told me this. I would be telling this story for years. THIS WHOLE TIME SHE LET ME THINK SHE WAS FROM A!!!

I would just tell him straight forwardly. I think the humor will work for itself. And record it please. ;;;Go with honest do t put any spin on it. ;;;Oh man. Best to come clean. It's pretty insignificant, if you ask me. Try to bring it up with some levity and hopefully it blows over with a few laughs you can share down the line. If he does react badly, I'd say he's probably a bit high strung, and overreacting. I wouldn't make a deal of it, at least. That's for sure.;;;For one thing, don't call it a white lie.

I am actually from country B.


I said I was born in country A, where my parents are supposedly from, but moved to country B when I was 8. I have visited country A but have never lived there and don’t share much common ancestry. I did not expect to see this man ever again.


Five years later, he still believes I am from country A and it’s weirdly become part of my identity. Both countries are relatively similar so it’s been easy to fake. In the beginning of our relationship, it wasn’t often discussed and I was still in a weird young needy phase so kept it up as I thought it was something he liked about me. I realise this was dumb but it then felt like it was too late to be like “I’m actually B-ish!” He’s never met my family and I don’t think he suspects anything.


My sisters wedding is in six weeks and we are both attending. Obviously the time has come to admit this lie but I’ve no idea how to do so. Do I go serious? Do I try and make him find it funny? I am a complete idiot but our relationship is very healthy other than my whole nationality being a fraud.


TLDR told a bad date I was a different nationality, we’ve been in a relationship for 5 years and he’s about to meet my entire family.

Edit :

-Both A &amp; B are very similar countries to an outsider, A is probably more famous. They share a language and it’s very common for someone to have dual nationality A/B however I do not.

-in country C where I currently live, I am regularly asked if I am from country A and I often used to reply yes to make people feel good about themselves. I suffered/suffer from  being a massive people pleaser.

-the lie isn’t a big lie supported by lots of little lies, it’s really just the big lie. The above points mean I’ve not had to really put in much effort to maintain the lie.

t2_3byjwko2,"Yeah I am in the exact same boat as you. Last year I threw my bf a party that took 3 months to plan, and put in hours for my friends birthdays (in my university town not my hometown) only to get nothing in return. For one girl she had me spend 2 weeks planning her celebration and didn't even thank me. Then my 22nd bday came around (aka my Taylor Swift Bday that I had been talking about for like 6 years) and.....nothing happened. My friends at uni each wrote ""Happy bday"" on my fb wall. My boyfriend cooked me a dinner and we watched Netflix. I cried for over a month about it. Granted, he feels really guilty and did a huge Valentines celebration and promised a big TS-themed party in my honour with my hometown friends this summer. We shall see though. Honestly, I cut out the friends who did nothing for me. It was my personal last straw of ""I always put in hours of effort for anything concerning them and they consistently do nothing for me"". If you are 18 then you are probs going to uni next year - focus on the fresh start coming up! 

   Remember - even if birthdays aren't important to them you made it clear they are important to you. Surround yourself with people who care about the things that you find important BECAUSE they are important to you. If they ask why you aren't doing anything simply say ""I am not putting in time, effort, and money for people who have no interest for doing the same for me"". Good luck and stay strong! &lt;3;;;Yeah I hate all these comments just saying to get over it. Our whole lives, we have been taught that we have one special day a year to celebrate ourselves. It doesn't matter if it's just a hallmark holiday or if other people don't care about it, if you care about it that's what matters. 

Also, people in the comments don't really seem to understand how much it hurts to see everyone else's birthdays get acknowledged and yours gets skimmed over. It sucks. It's just a giant slap in the face, reminding you that they are capable of celebrating a birthday and they do care, just not about yours. It fucking sucks and it's a shitty feeling. It's natural and normal to feel sad for being excluded and forgotten. This exact thing has happened to me my whole life and I know how sad it can make you.

Anyway, when you get older, birthdays will matter less, people will care about them less and planning your own birthday dinner will be no big deal. For now my only advice is to not set huge expectations for your friends on your birthday and just try not to take their forgetfulness personally. Or maybe just find better friends who are as excited about your birthday as you are.;;;I was literally born on 8/8/88.  Used it for almost every AIM / AOL thing, make jokes about it all the time.  Every year, like clock work, my friends/family will message me days after or weeks after my birthday apologize for missing it.;;;I dont like people telling you what should be important and what shouldnt. Reading the other comments almost made me upset. If you value this date and people close to you know about it they should respect it. And as far as i understand these people also value this date. So make sure to be honest about these feelings and confront them. Better then feeling upset when you see them.

Also youre also aware that you werent obvious about it. So next time make sure to announce that you want cake and celebration. ;;;I get where you are coming from.  I recently ended a friendship like this.  My friend would always expect a really great gift on her birthday, me buying the cake, chipping in for her daughter's party, a gift for her son's birthday ..... but when my birthday comes around all I get are the sound of crickets chirping. And a ""why didn't you tell me?""  I did. Three times, and do you not have a calendar because it's on the same date every year. 

It happened again last year and that was enough for me.  I'm not going all out for you and yours when you can't be bothered when it's my turn.;;;Next time, plan something. Even if it's just getting dinner together (or drinks when you're older). At your age, maybe just go out to a fun movie that weekend and then invite all your friends.

That way, you're reminding them that it's your birthday with a tangible event they're invited to, and even if they don't bring a cake you still get to celebrate. 

But don't let this simmer. It's senior year, if you end it with a grudge you might lose some of your important friends. Also, you can do something simple like a cupcake and a card for a birthday girl. Not much $$$ or time out of your pocket, but you still acknowledge it and come out the better person.;;;On my 18th birthday I stayed home doing my families laundry.  I believe my grandparents and one friend, not even a particularly close friend, called and that was it.  I know the pain of that and I am really sorry your friends neglected you.  I think now might be the time to start re-evaluating your friendships.  Forgetting a birthday can happen, that is potentially forgivable, but the behavior of some of your friends (forgetting your birthday, asking you to buy their cakes, getting huffy when you said they were only getting hugs) is... questionable.  I'd start looking really hard at what these people actually bring to your life.  This isn't about presents or a cake or anything like that, but whether or not you feel like they are important to them and whether you feel they value you as a person.;;;My birthday is super important to me too, I don't expect any gifts but I do expect my friends to text me to congratulate me. I don't exagerate when I say it means the world to me that my friends do that.

I don't know for how long you've known your friends, if I where you, after all you did for them I'd be preety pissed however that doesn't solve anything. I suggest that after a few weeks go by you let your friends kmow how important your birthday is to you, let some time pass so it doesn't seem lile you're scolding them (that would be weird).;;;I think its pretty normal for friends to forget birthdays. I think its kind of strange you are still bitter about it. Let it go. ;;;Did you know birthday was just a ruse by Hallmark in order to promote their greeting cards . Stop this chain. Things happen move on. Birthdays don't make sense. It's a fake pretend-sake celebration, people aren't true to themselves. What are we even celebrating, that we are born.

In a nutshell, my parents are 1st gen immigrants to the UK and it wasn't until a couple years ago that they really took to celebrating birthdays and other events outside Easter and Xmas. Because of this, I really try to celebrate the birthday's of others, getting a card together, buying a present, getting a cake to surprise them with etc. I did this for everyone of my friends' birthdays.

I had lots of ideas of what to do for my 18th birthday (which was last September) since that March. I often discussed with my friends about it. We had been friends for about 2 years (some longer, some shorter) I planned to have a party but I couldn't afford to host one. Nevertheless I was still excited about turning 18, since I'd been craving independence. I spoke about my birthday with them for weeks, even counting down the days.

The day of my birthday, they had all completely forgot. I was too shocked to say anything but I had hoped maybe they were planning to surprise me at lunch or something like that. It wasn't until my brother came to talk to me that they all started saying ""Omg why didn't you say anything?"" 

I was way too shocked (in the worst way possible). I literally said yesterday that I was 18 tomorrow?? I laughed it off, said I needed the toilet and went away to cry while they finished their lunch.

In hindsight, I know I should have been explicit about wanting a cake, some presents, maybe a balloon and all that jazz. I actually laughed writing that last paragraph, I actually can't believe I cried so much. I still feel quite guilty about still crying during the celebration with my family (""I'm just happy that I get to see my 18th birthday"" sob sob). One friend even got me a double Xmas present to make it up to me.

I thought I was okay and over the whole thing until recently.

Two of my friends have birthdays this April. My friends constantly talk about what presents, what things to plan for their birthdays, even talking about how much they had paid for them (lots, considering how cheap some of them are sometimes). A few days ago, one of my friends (had the nerve to have) asked me to buy their cakes. I was so pissed and told her that I wouldn't be buying anything for either birthday. One of the birthday girls overheard our not so private conversation and asked me if I getting anything for the other birthday girl (who I had known the longest). I told her that the other girl was only getting hugs and she seemed really annoyed, she went away huffing.

The birthday girl who I had known the longest confided in me today about her present for the other birthday girl (the one that went away in a huff). She is getting her some really nice jewellery, she gave me all the details. After she'd left, I was pretty upset, considering this girl who I consider my best friend has never in our 4 or so years of friendship brought me a gift (that she doesnt gift to everyone else also) and has always been adamant to me about not doing so. 

I'm just not okay when people outside my family bring up birthdays anymore and I have no heart to pretend to be ecstatic about celebrating my friends'.

The only thing that making me feel okay is knowing that I won't have to see them every day anymore after this summer.

t2_3i7i85y5,"To be honest, it's partly just a maturity thing.  You are still young and growing and learning.  The other issue is that many people feel insecure in an LDR.  You don't get the daily, in person interactions that you get in a non-LDR relationship.

Alright so, this is my second long term relationship and it’s a LDR. About 5hr drive. We’ve been together for about 7 months and we have a year until we plan to close the gap. 

I trust him, he hasn’t given me any indication of unfaithfulness. This is 100% a me problem. 

For the most part I try to keep it to myself - we do communicate about it and he’s very understanding. I’ll never control him or tell him he’s not allowed to go out, who he can speak to etc. I want to be a partner not a parent. 

I’m jealous that I’m not spending time with him, that he talks to his female friends. His past, when he mentions flings or how hot a girl he used to know was. But he talks about the attractiveness of guys too, that’s just how he describes people. Things of that nature. 

The thing is... god it makes me feel so shit. I’m never jealous in other aspects of my life so it’s such a strange and unsettling emotion. My mind just runs wild with all sorts of scenarios. 

Maybe this comes from an place of insecurity?

t2_8gt1e,"So here’s the thing. When people get sober, they often have to cut off their previous social circle in order to stay sober. Their previous social circle may not understand that. She certainly should apologize to you and make amends, but it sounds also like you were a person she drank a lot *with*, and in that case she has an association with you and alcohol, and maybe that’s why she is cutting ties. It’s shitty and you are definitely owed an apology, but that could be why. ;;;Has she apologized for all the shitty things she did? (To my knowledge, isn't that part of the recovery process for recovering addicts?)

You don't have to continue being friends with anyone. You don't owe it to her, and she has no right to it.

She did very shitty things. There are consequences to actions like that. Including the loss of friends you have hurt.

The fact that she is now sober does not make the hurt go away. Only a real apology, acknowledging all the pain caused can even begin to heal it. Even that may not be enough.

If you can't be her friend anymore, don't be.;;;It sounds like for the past 15 years, you may have used her drinking as an excuse for her shitty behavior. Now that she's sober, you think that she'd be a better person, but maybe you're realizing she's just a shitty person regardless. I don't know... I've had similar friendships where I thought if they'd better themselves or their lives, they'd treat me better, but that day never came. ;;;I just wanna say that it sounds like alcohol was not really the thing that made her a shitty person back then. ;;;I’m surprised you remained friends with her after the shit she has done. Alcohol is not an excuse.;;;Why don't you talk to her about this? It seems like a good opportunity to sit her down and say that you still hold a lot of resentment and anger about her past behavior but are proud of her for getting sober- however, it seems like now she's not being a good friend and doesn't ever seem to have time for you or ask you how you are. It may be that shes unaware of her behavior and wants to change. It may be that she realized she doesn't have a lot in common with her friends when she's not wasted, but you never know unless you talk to her about it. ;;;When I got sober, it was like being reborn.  I wanted everything about my life to be different than it was before.  I moved to a new city, started a new career, never spoke to anyone I new from before except my mom and 1 friend on occasion.  But anyone I ever used with was out - even if they didn't do anything wrong.  I just wanted to turn the page on my life, and seeing their faces was not only embarrassing, but a sad reminder. 

Maybe she's pulling away from you for these reasons, or something close to it.  ;;;Friendships don't have to have a hard line, they can eb and flow like a tide.  It's understandable to keep someone pushed away and to only catch up with them when absolutely convenient, and it's also expected that someone not living in the same city/state as another person will lose personal touch that makes friendships closer.  There doesn't need to be a line in the sand unless she is a bad friend, which she doesn't seem like a friend at all in my opinion.  She seems like a childhood friend you grew apart from, no guilt in that.  Her adult actions have shown that she is selfish and does not care about the personal details of someone who considered her a friend, I think you two can be friendly acquaintances moving forward.  Let her grow up and maybe she'll apologize for how she treated you, until then I'd keep them at arm's length.;;;&gt;I could go on and on about all the things she's done over the years that have hurt our relationship, but I'll try to keep it brief. Her drinking caused her to do a lot of things that I really felt uncomfortable with, such as having an affair with her former boss who was married with 3 children and sleeping with my boyfriend at the time's best friend who had a long term girlfriend.

Why is any of this your business?

&gt;She would continually put me and my friends in potentially dangerous situations trying to go home with guys that were shady and getting mad or even physical with us when we would try to stop her.

What made you think you needed to babysit your adult friend?

&gt;One of the big things that drastically hurt our relationship is initiating a threesome with me and the guy I was seeing.

This is admittedly shitty. Why did you continue being friends with her?

&gt;One of them brought along a guy I thought was cute and I wanted to try to talk to. I told my friends that and they all told me to go for it, but later that night my friend tried to get him to sleep with her, he refused and she flipped out to the point he left and then she accused him of stealing $400 out of her wallet and wanted me to get my roommate involved because he was her boyfriend's friend.

The dude did not belong to you. Although her drama over the situation was stupid, the idea that you ""held rights"" to hit on this guy is childish.

&gt;I feel resentful that I spent years being her friend when she was a giant mess and now that she seems to have it together, she doesn't have time for me. 

In all honesty, it sounds like you were all too happy to nail yourself to the cross for someone who couldn't have cared any less, and now you implicitly expect a debt to be paid back. Aside from the threesome thing, every situation above involved you putting yourself in the line of fire for someone who didn't ask you to.

Cut her out and learn from this experience.;;;Looking at you, she sees massive social debt. (Assuming she has anything like a functioning conscience.) Sometimes it's easier to cut people off than to make amends, or even to apologize.;;;Sounds like what’s happening is the opposite of the thread title.
If she doesn’t care then there is no need for confrontation or a big final speech. Just don’t bother trying to catch up.;;;Dude, tell her. You’re an adult. She cheated with your boyfriend. She risked your life and ruined relationships for her. And she’s not even trying to be a friend now. Tell her how upset you are and how betrayed you felt then and how that doesn’t even measure up to the betrayal now. Don’t accuse her or be nasty, but state I feel sentences and let her know the truth of your resentment. She’s not dumb, she probably know that’s how most of her sober friends feel ;;;You're way overdue for ending this relationship. I'd text her and just say I can't make it, then let her drift off to her better life without you.

She knows she was awful, I'm not sure there's much point rehashing it.

Just let it.;;;She doesn't deserve your friendship. You can explain that all the things she has done to hurt, damage and betray you over the years mean you can't be her friend any longer.

When I tried to call it off, they didn't stop and I ended up just leaving while they continued. That seriously broke my trust and hurt me a lot. She apologized profusely and I told her I forgave her and I get it was a drunken mistake but I know I am angry about it because I really liked the guy and that ruined my relationship with him (not that she was the only one responsible for the situation). Soon after that we went out to celebrate my college graduation with my roommates and some of my other friends. One of them brought along a guy I thought was cute and I wanted to try to talk to. I told my friends that and they all told me to go for it, but later that night my friend tried to get him to sleep with her, he refused and she flipped out to the point he left and then she accused him of stealing $400 out of her wallet and wanted me to get my roommate involved because he was her boyfriend's friend. I was pretty confident he didn't steal from her and when I brought it up to my roommate she refused to get involved knowing that my friend can be a little off the rails sometimes. This was all right before she got sober. 

I could describe many more instances where things like this have happened, but I'm sure you all get the picture. 

I have since moved to a different state and haven't done a great job keeping in touch, but I try to get together with her when I'm in town and ask her how she's doing occasionally. I bought her a Christmas gift and invited her to spend Christmas with my family since she is not close with hers, but she declined. Last time I saw her she didn't even ask about my new job (which was a big and exciting deal for me) and didn't even know what city I now live in. I know her sobriety takes a lot of effort and dedication on her part so she may not have time to worry about all the things going on in my life, but I feel like she has made no effort at all. I feel resentful that I spent years being her friend when she was a giant mess and now that she seems to have it together, she doesn't have time for me. 

I'm back in town visiting my family and I'm supposed to see her tonight, and honestly I feel like I don't even want to. I feel guilty because I should be happy and supportive of her new life that she seems to be doing great in, and we have mutual friends who I don't want to upset by not continuing a relationship with her. 

When is it okay to say you don't want to be someone's friend anymore? Especially after so many years of friendship. 

TLDR: My friend of 15 years is now sober and I feel like she doesn't care about my life anymore. I'm resentful because I spent so many years with her being a giant mess and now that she has it together she's gone. When is it time to let a friendship go?

t2_3i6elf5j,"The problem may be with central Texas. There are lots of parts of the US where being a foreigner is relatively easier.

My dad was a European who lived in Oklahoma for a year. It almost broke up the marriage until my parents moved to Chicago. Suddenly he fit right in.;;;Are you in an area where there’s not much diversity? If everyone else around her is similar &amp; your wife stands out as “different,” that is probably getting old really fast. Even if well-meaning, constantly pointing out your wife’s accent is a reminder that she’s “different” from everyone else, &amp; that’s not always desirable when you’re just trying to go about your daily life. And that’s giving the benefit of the doubt that no one is making the “accent = less intelligent/educated” stereotypes or making any political commentary about immigration or Russia (assuming she’s from a Slavic-sounding language). 

I don’t think there’s anything that you can do except to try to sympathize with your wife. Telling her that her accent sounds cool may not be as helpful to her as telling her that you understand that it’s difficult / frustrating / whatever she is expressing to you that people are commenting on her accent instead of listening to what she’s saying. Depending which country in Europe you were in previously &amp; how good you were at the native language &amp; how that country feels about Americans, you may have had a different experience yourself. 

The improbable solution is that you could move somewhere that has a more diverse population, but I understand that’s an extreme solution that’s not always possible. 

Edit: accent, not accident;;;You can’t do much to help her “change it”. It’s a natural process. With time her speech will change but traces of her native accent will remain for the rest of her life. That of course doesn’t mean she cannot speak English nicely and in some cases better than others. ;;;&gt;She does have a pretty heavy East European accent.

A heavy accent can make it difficult for others to understand her be isolating.   If it bothers her that much, find her a speech coach.   A good coach won't change her ""voice"", just moderate the accent.
;;;Im first geneation american from a household that spoke polish and german. I didnt start learning english until I was in grade school and had years of speach classes to ""correct"" my accent. 

Personally it isnt a big deal to have an accent to me and i can code switch my accent between the midwestern one i was taught and my natural one.

It will just be a skill she learns eventually to do. If she wants to accelerate it she may want to look into a speach therapist in your area. Or an online conversation partner. ;;;Help her. She's trying to fit in. The accent makes her 'different' and different isn't always good. With things like jobs and education, one doesn't get to pick what asshole one ignores. She can't pick her attitude in such a setting. It's different in social life, where you can dictate that. It sounds like for professional purposes it would benefit her to fade the accent a bit. ;;;Don't let her force a new accent. Her accent is probably very charming, and central texas is just the wrong audience for it. Even if she is living there forever, she should be proud of who she is and what she sounds like. My mother tried to get rid of her accent in her early 30s and it did work unfortuantely, and now as an older women she deeply regrets losing part of her identity for what she saw was the comfort of others. Her's was also prompted by icy or sarcastic texans, coincidentally. ;;;Just so you know, Your accent is not your voice. She will start speaking more and more 'American' without even noticing it.

Accents tend to be pretty thic when first using a language, but the more you surround yourself with another accent the more it will bleed into your own speech. 

Also! Singing! Country songs! Or just American singers to start more subtle. . So she can listen to them phonetically, sing along and feel how those sounds are produced.

Also a voice coach if she's serious and really wants to get rid of her accent. I understand. English isn't my first language and while my accent is pretty subtle and I can fake a few different ones when I focus on it, it bothers me that you still hear the 'bad' enunciation when I'm focusing more in the contents of the conversation. ;;;It's understandable that in a new place, your wife wants to fit in a little better. When I lived in a small town in Ireland, I got tired of getting asked about my 'accent', so I figured out how to do a light irish accent for things like going to the store and making small talk with strangers. It just makes you feel more normal. 

It is, however, unnecessary, because accents are little more than a curiosity for most people and nobody is going to judge her for it. Most people will find it exotic and interesting. I mean, hell, the first lady has an eastern european accent, and that's like the last thing people bring up about her.

If after your reassurance it's still really something she wants to do, offer to help her out, then why not? Maybe you guys could do some dialect classes together. Make it a fun game. 

;;;This strikes me as sad because i had a strong accent and changed it to sound more American when I went to a school in the Midwest. I regret it so much now. I feel like I’ve lost a bit of myself and whenever I visit home I get teased for it (gently) but my accent isn’t 100% American either. I wish I had the courage to just be unique and own it before it became a habit to speak this way. ;;;If having an accent keeps her from fitting in she’s trying to fit in with the wrong people. Accents are cool. I’m from north Texas and would never exclude someone due to their accent.;;;My partner lives in Australia but originally from Europe, he does neutralise his accent to make himself understandable, he was already doing this before we met. He felt the need to do this and still continues to do so. I still don't get why he feels he needs to do it, but it's his decision. 

However, him trying to understand me is a whole thing in itself. I am a native English speaker from NZ, and I speak fast with slang. Initially he didn't understand me often and he would say yes when he didn't understand me lol. It took him a while to tell me and still he can't understand me at times. Oh well. My point being is that you may need more discussions as to what the root cause of this is. Maybe she wants to be able to have conversations with people without having to ask them to repeat or them to ask her to repeat. It can get tiring.

Reminds me of when I went to San Diego zoo and an employee asked me where I said I was from and I said New Zealand and he said ohh Brazil that's nice. All I thought was facepalm. Although we speak English we all sound a little different, which is I think a lot more diverse than written English.

I work with quite a few non-native speakers from various countries and for me the easiest thing to do is to listen for the word and not the sound (if that makes sense), so I do not get hung up on the accent so much. Occasionally I get an accent that is strong but you usually get used to it after a while. But in most situations it's usually my accent and speed that's a problem lol. I never have a problem if someone asks me what I said or to slow down, and I make sure to express this because I know my accent/speed is difficult. Most people are fine with repeating for non-native speakers, if not then they are an arse.;;;She will always have some sort of accent. And that's perfectly OK, and people may find it cute, or charming, or whatever. If people where you live won't accept ANYONE with an accent, then maybe you need to find somewhere else to live. But assuming that they are just not used to picking up a different way of speaking, the key is to be easily understandable. Help her with that without worrying about her ""losing"" her accent - she will always have a cool accent to you, but she will be a lot happier if she is confident about her language.

If she is open to you helping her, maybe start re-saying some words as the locals do every time she says them differently My husband asked me to help him with his English, so I started correcting him. It feels awful and rude to start with, but we both kept working at it, and he is much more confident now. I started with words where he could say something that sounded like a swear word (in his case, shit/sheet/sheep/shirt, or bitch/beach), and then words where even I wasn't sure what he was saying (dog/duck/dough). And we just kept going. It does help.;;;It sucks she feels this way. I find that non-US natives often feel self-conscious about being “foreign” and are reluctant to say where they moved from, etc. 

But there is absolutely nothing wrong with having a non-US accent considering that she isn’t from the US. Instead of encouraging her to change it using a speech coach or something like that, I’d encourage her to embrace it. I am American and I personally don’t care that much for blending. I always find it sad when non-Americans feel they need to water down their background. ;;;I hope she can remember she has no reason to feel bad or potentially like a burden. She can speak 2 or more languages while most others can’t! ;;;If she wants to improve her accent, you can help her. One thing I have learned is Americans really judge people with a different accent. There are not that many accents in America, compared to other countries, and American accent unites many people. 

Encourage her to take accent reduction class. If she says something wrong, gently correctly her. ;;;",1553888423.0,b71p9c,t3_b71p9c,19,16,/r/relationships/comments/b71p9c/my_27m_wife_24f_has_become_very_selfconscious_of/,"I've been together with my wife for a little over three years, we got married about a year ago.

At the time I was an American living in Europe, she is East European. 

We moved to the US about six months ago. It was known well in advance, she was fully aware we would be going to America at the time we got married, and she was completely on board with it.

Since moving back to the United States (Central Texas), she has been working hard on fitting in. She has a part time job and intends to go back to school as soon as she can.

But I've noticed she seems to be getting really self-conscious of her accent.

She *does* have a pretty heavy East European accent. It's definitely need bothered me and I actually think it sounds pretty cool.

Maybe two months ago or so she randomly asked me if I thought her accent was really noticeable. I told her that, yeah, East European does kind of stick out in Central Texas, but I love her voice and it's nothing to be ashamed of.

Then a few weeks ago I was using YouTube on her computer for some reason or another, I saw she has been watching a ton of video tutorials on American accents.

That prompted me to sit down with her and ask if the accent thing is really bothering her. She said it was. She feels like people here think she sounds weird and it is hard for her to fit in sounding like a ""foreigner"". 

I felt really crappy that I didn't notice beforehand, and asked her what she wants to do about it. She didn't seem to really know, because she personally likes her voice, but she doesn't want to keep from fitting in.

I told her I didn't think anyone relaly thought less of her for it, and anyone who does is an asshole anyway, but it didn't seem to help. I guess they talk about it alot at her job and it makes her feel bad.

I'm not sure what to do. I'm worried it will seem that I want her to change if I encourage her to train away her accent (which I love anyway). But I don't want to keep her from it if she really feels it would be helpful and she really wants to change it.

t2_2xmpeqxs,"It is such a ridiculous and huge amount of pressure these days that everyone needs to have some grand passion.  People are all over the spectrum with hobbies and passions and the lack of them does not always indicate lack of depth, or character, or interests, or whatever.  

Some people are super even keeled and never get ""passionate"" about much in life (my mom being one) and it doesn't mean they won't love you deeply, care for you, and be fiercely loyal.  It doesn't mean they won't get interested in and excited about doing things with you.   My mom has always only ever had one or two friends she put effort into maintaining friendships with, and this suited her just fine.  Nothing is wrong with her at all.  My Dad is super outgoing, energetic, has loads of active hobbies and way more friends.  They have been getting along just great for over 35 years.

Other people jump around from hobby to hobby (this is me).  I get interested in something, do it for a few months, get bored and switch to something else.  This is not a flaw or lack of passion or lack of commitment.  It's just how  I'm wired.   There is an EXCELLENT TedTalk by Emily Wopnick about this topic.  I suggest you check it out!;;;Everyone has the same 168 hours a week, from billionaires to the homeless begging for money. Take out about 50 hours of sleep, and you're left with about 120 hours or so. Everyone does *something* with their time. You need to start asking her the right questions about what she does with her time. That being said, there's nothing wrong with being a procrastinator (just look at all the time I spend on Reddit). 

Just as a side note, especially a girl who will overlook a 10 year age gap with a man with ""many flaws,"" she may be looking to be a wife and mother asap. Maybe all her passions are devoted to future children she may have with *you*.;;;Maybe she isnt open about her true passions? Maybe she is a furry. ;;;She has no hobbies, you have many. Sounds like a great opportunity to introduce her to some :D I get that it might feel dull at first, but there is no harm in at least trying to share some hobbies with her. :);;;Be a little guarded and look out for signs she may be dismissive avoidant.  I just got out of a relationship with a woman who had similar situation with no hobbies or interests.  As soon as things got to a point of turning serious she pulled away and got very distant. You can google it, and maybe your girl will be different, but it sucks when you've fallen for them. ;;;You could try getting her involved in hobbies. If you like her and you want to hang out maybe join a weekly thing together?

Sounds like you guys have a genuine connection which is something you've been missing so I wouldn't call it quits immediately, see where it goes if you share your passions with her and encourage her to find her own.  If it goes nowhere at that point or she actively discourages you from your hobbies that's when I'd call it quits. ;;;[removed];;;Maybe she does but doesn't like to talk about them. ;;;So what does she do in her spare time?

Make her decide what you guys gonna do for today when you have free time or hanging out.;;;I'd say her lack of hobbies and friends are a yellow flag, proceed with caution as it might be a sign of mental illness/inability to maintain relationships or a core identity.

t2_3i3vzvir,"Just because she says she doesn't like something doesn't mean you can't do it. It sounds like you are trying way to hard to please her about things she probably doesn't even care about. Have some sense of self and do things because you want to do them. Not because you think that's what she wants. If she loves you, doing little things differently won't matter at all. As for the best friend thing, grow a spine and see your friend. Yes it will make her unhappy, but she needs to get over that. ;;;The issue isn't that she changes her mind...
The issue is that you keep changing YOURSELF to fit her ideal.

The issue is actually with you. Stop changing yourself. Do you. For example, why are you changing the way you open cans just because she said so? Why did you stop playing guitar just because she expressed a preference it wasn't her favorite? Don't you have an identity of your own?....Or are you just her puppet? 

A healthy relationship is one where you are both your own person, and you COMPROMISE. You are literally just trying to act like her puppet, or a robot...and of course that would become frustrating, because you're not a robot. 

A normal relationship would be one where your gf says ""hey I don't like this genre of music on the guitar"", and you say ""oh ok, maybe I will play in another room, or you can put on headphones.""

OR another example, your gf says ""I don't like the icons on your computer"", and you say, ""if you use my computer, I can create a separate profile just for you and you can do your own icons your own way. But this is my profile and log in, so I'm not changing my icons"".

If you had more of an identity on your own, and stood by what you felt strongly about, her changing moods wouldn't matter. You guys could work through big disagreements if necessary, and small ones become a non-issue as time passes.

She is 100% controlling but at the same time, it seems you have literally 0 identity. This is not a good relationship model. ;;;&gt; my guitar collects dust in the corner

Get rid of the GF and dust off the guitar.;;;She sounds really controlling and manipulative. This isn't healthy at all and you shouldn't be trying to change everything about yourself to accommodate her. The fact that she is asking you to isolate yourself and you have to hide things or walk on eggshells around her means this might be an abusive relationship. I think you need to really consider how she treats you and if that is how you want to be treated by someone who should be your partner. ;;;Your girlfriend isn't looking for an actual relationship *partner*, but something she can micromanage and control.

In a healthy relationship, 99% of people have infinitely more important and interesting things to worry about than:

* How their partner opens cans
* How icons appear on their partner's computer
* The ""proper way"" to wear socks (???)
* Etc., etc., etc...

She sounds exhausting and has managed to make you feel shitty about making and performing music - one of the most basic, simple pleasures in life. I'm with /u/javanator999:

&gt; my guitar collects dust in the corner

""Get rid of the GF and dust off the guitar."";;;Anytime someone tries to prevent you from seeing important people in your life, it’s a huge red flag. She’s never met or spoken to your best friend, but 1) doesn’t like him, and 2) thinks he’s in love with you??  And her argument is because you’re bi &amp; your best friend is gay? That’s more than a little bi/homophobic. Does she also prevent you from being close friends with women? 

And a lot of the things she wanted you to change about yourself are personal things/things that don’t have literally anything to do with her, so it’s weird that she asked you/bullied you into changing those things. Who cares how someone opens a can or wears their socks??? 

I feel like half of the advice I give on here is to break up shitty relationships, but honestly, she doesn’t seem like a good gf. She doesn’t have any right to limit who you are in contact with and she seems to be gaslighting you by pretending her bullying wasn’t meant to be taken seriously. No one in a relationship should feel like they need to change everything about themselves to keep their SO happy. That’s emotional abuse. ;;;This is definitely on purpose. She is getting off on controlling you, and even more on changing her mind and making you change again.

You need to stop changing to meet her requests.

TBH she sounds incredibly toxic and unreasonable. No-one should be telling you you cant speak to a friend they dont even know.

You yourself might want to see a therapist to work on your self-esteem and spine.

Being scared of how your partner might react is no way to live.;;;I think the bigger issue here is why are you changing all of these behaviors and why is she asking you to? ;;;Mate. There are 7 billion people on this earth. The chance that this random woman loves you for you, and isn't desperately clinging to you because she's lonely, is incredibly remote. You can do better than this. You used to play guitar. You have an awesome friend who you love who you don't speak to anymore because of what? Because of no reason.  

Love is true and real, but this isn't love. Go to therapy, but go on your own and work on yourself, because I guarantee that your girlfiend will get angry when you start to put your foot down and say ""no, actually I don't mind that my voice is high when I sing, and I actually like those socks, and Geoff was a good friend to me then, and I have treated him badly."" And she will threaten to leave you, but she won't because she is afraid of being lonely.;;;Eurgh. Stopped reading after the comment about your guitar and singing.

Now she is out of new things to criticize, so she has to recycle old things, just with a different spin. 

Leave her and find a kind GF. Kind people usually stay the same, just as mean people do. ;;;What a nightmare. I’m sorry but this sounds like such a shitty relationship. You’re allowing her to change you which makes me think she fell in love with a man that isn’t you but the image you’ve made her believe is you. ;;;Your girlfriend doesn’t like you.

Wow that sounds so incredibly controlling.  What does she care how you open up a can?  

Do it your way!  Does it hurt her?  Does it affect her in any way?  Why do you always cave in to her demands?  

Stop doing that!  Be yourself.  If she can't accept you for who you are then this person is not good for you..  especially if the dealbreaker ends up being: ""I don't like the way you put on your socks"";;;Find someone that gets wet as hell/rock hard when you play the guitar. This chick sucks.;;;Abusers use this kind of behavior to make their spouses feel like they can never do anything right, are to blame for it all, etc. It's a constant state of vigilance and anxiety, and it's done on purpose to maintain a sense of power over you. They also slowly but systematically separate their spouses from friends, family, and everybody else by forbidding contact like she did with you and your best friend.

I'm not saying she's abusive or an abuser at this point, but I just read a lot of warning signs in what you posted. Read up on the cycle of emotional abuse and see if it fits. At the very least, she's controlling and manipulative, and you should tell her to back the fuck off on all of it.;;;She's controlling and you're a pushover. She needs to go but you need to work on your hobbies, self esteem, friendships, etc. before you jump in the dating pool. You don't have to give up things you enjoy for someone unless you want to. And anyone who asks you to change something that isn't harmful or unhealthy is just straight up manipulative and you need to recognize that. ;;;She is playing you.She is manipulative and it will not be long until she becomes sneaky on you.End this and move on.Never look back.Different person ""my ass"".;;;Sounds closer to being your owner/ parole officer than being your girlfriend.

You need to stop caring exclusively about about what she thinks, a relationship should be where two people are equal and in harmony. It is not about one blindly obeying the other. 

She's not the authority on everything, she doesn't have access to a secret vault of wisdom you don't. If she has something to say about what you do or how you do it, it's literally her opinion. And your opinion counts as much as hers does. 

If she says ""I'm a different person now!"" That's not some statement of absolute fact. You're well within your rights to say ""yeah, that seems to be the one constant about you"" or whatever it is that you're thinking. 

You need to stop cowering around her and get a sense of who you are so that you can know what you're standing up for when you stand up for yourself. If that means you need to be single while you figure it out, I don't think that's a bad thing in this scenario. 
;;;you are being gaslight and emotional abused my brother.

you can just leave. you dont need a reason.;;;She's not lying or changing her mind really. She's impulsively getting you to stop doing something that annoys her in the moment and then forgetting about it because, well, you stop so it stops annoying her.

It's kind of manipulative, but it's more impulsively controlling I think. She isn't seriously thinking about these things. She's just making impulsive demands and you're accepting them because if you don't she gets worse. How she remembers or doesn't remember things is entirely through a self-centered lens and she doesn't seem to care how you're effected by her random requirements that she can't explain.

That random impulsive self-centered attitude sounds like a mess. She's not introspective about any of these things. She doesn't think them through. She doesn't remember them correctly. She doesn't care about how she effects you. She just gets annoyed and makes a demand and then forgets about it. That would drive me nuts after just a few times. The complete lack of introspection about her actions sounds exhausting, because you never know when they're going to change and she explains nothing.

That kind of casual self-centered behavior is making you miserable. You take her seriously and change, but she doesn't even take herself seriously or consider the consequences of what she does. Then when confronted she completely brushes off the consequences and basically blames you for taking her seriously in the first place! That sounds terrible. If she actually wanted to change she ***has*** to be more introspective about this problem. She has to actually demonstrate an understanding of what her demands are doing to you and why what she's doing is destructive. Without that introspection she isn't actually changing.;;;Obviously she is controlling.

With the sexually available best friend, I have a bit more sympathy for your GF, but she never even made an attempt to meet him and actually read the room with you two and made you block him on your phone.

I know breaking up with someone is hard, but it seems you have the green light from her to live your life the way you see fit, icons and all, so I say you do that. And tell her you're doing this. Tell her no more controlling demands, that you'll be doing things your way that makes you happy and content, all the while being respectful and a good BF to her. I think you'll see that she hasn't really changed, but stranger things have happened.;;;lol jesus christ dude, grow a spine;;;There are a looooot of red flags here. It’s not normal or reasonable in a healthy relationship for one partner to dictate how the other partner should behave to this degree. She seems incredibly controlling. Honestly, the fact that she changes her mind isn’t that weird to me, but the fact that she makes you abide by all of her preferences like this is alarming. Would she tolerate the same from you? ;;;There is right and wrong way to wear socks?

;;;Don't let anyone tell you who you can and cannot talk to. Don't let anyone tell you what you should or shouldn't do (like your guitar). This woman is controlling. almost abusive. She is trying to manipulate you  and isolate you. What does she care where the icons are on your computer? you need to get your best friend back.;;;A healthy relationship doesn't require you to change to this extent, make you leave your best friend, or *make you dread your SO coming home*. Leave and be you.;;;Either stop letting her control your behavior with her passive criticism or find someone who isn't so critical and controlling. ;;;Whoa. How did you get from ""she doesn't like these things"" to ""I must never do these things""? That's like... Dude. Whichever of you keeps taking things from ""I'm not a fan of that"" to ""you should NEVER DO THAT EVER"" needs to have one heck of a think about a lot of your life choices. 

Just for reference, the way this normally goes in healthy relationships is that knowing your partner's preferences informs what you ask them, and each preference is kind of an ongoing conversation so you learn how each others' tastes change over time. It's not like an open and shut, discuss it once and then NEVER EVER AGAIN, kind of thing for ""wants"". (""needs"" are different -- ""I need you to never cheat on me"", ""I need you to brush your teeth between eating peanut products and kissing me or else I might die"", etc).

For example, I usually can't stand jump scares. My partner knows this. So if we're hanging out together and playing a game or watching a movie, and it has jump scares, he'll mention it to me to warn me and offer to watch something else. Usually I'll be like ""yeah something-else please"" but occasionally I'll be in a mood to try something outside my comfort zone and I'll be like ""sure I'll watch a bit of this and see how it goes"". It's the ongoing nature of that conversation about preferences that lets us know where each of us is at on each one and how that changes over time. This process is how we've both learned about the details of my preferences -- it turns out that I'm fine with jump scares in unrealistic, cartoony stuff although they freak me out in more realistic media. 

Now if we'd gone ""no jump scares EVER and they shall never again be discussed"", we'd have a situation much like your own. Artificially ending a conversation about a preference by totally eliminating something from your life also removes the possibility of having that ongoing conversation where you learn about how your partner's preferences are changing over time. ;;;You sound less like a boyfriend, and more like a pet that changes its behavior based on what its master likes and doesn't like. That needs to change. ;;;the answer is to not date assholes. she's definitely an asshole, so I think you know what the solution here is.;;;I think you’re missing the bigger picture here, OP. She’s not a different person. She’s a control freak who will badger you and beat you over the head with her nonsense and then gaslight and act like it’s not her fault you stopped doing something. You need to learn how to say “no” to someone when you’re passionate about something or when there’s no real reason to change the way you do something. Time to dump the gf and grow a backbone, man. ;;;Lol my wife was impressed with me playing guitar when we first met.  Now after a few years she is sick of it cause she realizes you actually have to practice and it can be pretty tedious to sit and listen to. ;;;A lot of this sounds way too controlling for me to give any advice beyond:  be the person you want to be and do things the way you want to do them. If she doesn't like the way you are then that's her issue &amp; her problem to get used to. ;;;It does sound pretty rude that she told you she didn’t like you playing guitar, and she needs to be less insecure about your friend. Telling you to go no contact is way too controlling and you should have enough trust in a relationship that your significant other can have friends of various sexes or preferences without it being a threat. 

The flip-flopping about things though isn’t necessarily a big deal. Maybe she’s just opinionated and doesn’t really filter what she says, so she ends up sounding really critical in the moment but isn’t actually particularly passionate about every little thing. Maybe she focuses on one of those smaller topics and will dig her heels in on it when challenged but later when thinking about it from a different perspecive on her own, she doesn’t care so much. Early on, she could have nit picked things as a way to affectionately tease you, or because she thought ‘oh i’ll tell him how i do this thing just to share my opinion’ and then obviously forgot about it and got used to doing things another way. Her saying she changed as a person is just a way to say ‘yup time passed and i guess i do this thing differently now’ not really ‘i secretly underwent a metamorphosis and now you don’t know who i am.’

I don’t think people who do casual flip flopping in discussions like that mean anything by it, but I can see how difficult it would be for a person who tries to change their behavior to make someone like that happy. Just be confident in yourself and your opinions and the way you like to do things, don’t change yourself for someone else, especially for things as trivial as desktop icon organization. Or for anything as dumb as baseless jealousy towards a best friend. 

I suggest you talk to her about it if it’s bothering you so much, as well as your feeling that she filters what kind of stuff gets brought up in therapy. Good luck!;;;Ok the thing is she wants you to be more gay cause you are suppressing this part of your bi. And she right. Try to not have sex with her cause you have headache and talk more about boys and etc;;;You need to learn not to take women seriously when they say silly stuff like this. Just treat their requests as a joke. Laugh it off. Arguing will get you nowhere.

I change my ways. Years later she will randomly change her mind, say not to pay attention to what she said before since she's a different person now. I can't seem to get over what she said in the first place so I still do it my changed way. I also don't know what things she has changed her mind on and what she hasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I have been together for  4ish years and moved in together after 10 months. Over the first couple of years, she would tell me things that she liked and disliked – things you learn about someone when you’re living together or just around each other for a while. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of these can be small things such as: How to open a can (there’s apparently a wrong and right way?), a jumper or shirt that she doesn’t like on me, the way I have my computer icons set up, how I wore my socks… There are way more, but of course now that I’m writing this post I can’t remember them!

&amp;#x200B;

I changed my actions so that I did things the way she wanted me to do them (because honestly, the way she said it made me feel like an idiot for doing it my way in the first place). What annoys me is that now, a couple of years later, these things will come up again. She asks me why I did something ABC and I’ll respond with “Because 2 years ago you told me that you didn’t like it when I did XYZ”. And she will say “Oh, I was a different person back then! You can totally do it now haha don’t you know me??”. She never told me that she changed her mind! How was I supposed to know?? And the thing is, she doesn’t even remember telling me that she didn’t like it in the first place!

&amp;#x200B;

While this is annoying, it becomes more of an issue to me when it comes to some bigger examples.

I used to play the guitar and sing in my free time. Back in the first few months of our relationship, I’d still occasionally pick up a guitar and play while she was around (usually if she was in the shower or playing video games by herself). Every single time she’d make a comment about how my voice was too high, she didn’t like the genre I played, I could be doing something else instead of playing the guitar, etc. So now my finger callouses are gone, my guitar collects dust in the corner. Then, starting a few months ago she’d occasionally ask “Hey, why don’t you play guitar anymore?”. !#$#% How do I then explain that she pretty much told me that she didn’t want to play, I lost my drive, and that’s why I can now barely bust out a C chord! Is this one of those things that she randomly changed her mind about and didn’t tell me? I still don't play the guitar because I keep thinking about the times where she told me she didn't like me playing.

&amp;#x200B;

A really big issue we have is that right from the beginning my girlfriend has hated my best friend. He is back home in Canada so in the last 4 years I haven’t even seen him in person. My girlfriend has never met him, seen him, or talked to him. (the reason she hates him is because she thinks he’s in love with me. He’s gay, I’m bi so it’s possible but highly improbable). We used to Skype once a month or so, but my girlfriend put a shut down to that quickly. Eventually it got to the point that I was to cut all contact with him. So I went about a year of not talking to my best friend at all. Birthdays, Christmases, family deaths went by without my best friend and it sucked. He did get back in contact with me (through email, since he was blocked on my phone) and I… didn’t tell my girlfriend right away. She did eventually find out (because she periodically asks me if I’m in contact with Geoff and I didn’t want to lie) and a HUGE argument ensued. By the end of it though, she told me that she has no issue with me talking to him but I shouldn’t have lied. But she said it in a way that it was obvious that she had big issues with it and she even said that she still hates him. So based on her past actions, this could be one of those things that she said she didn’t like in the past, randomly changed her mind, and is now ok with me doing. But I’m still scared of talking to him in case my girlfriend sees and finds something to get upset over.

Try maybe keeping the junk out of the house, I know he’s an adult and can walk into a store to purchase whatever he likes but it might be worth a shot. Also, when I was on a weight loss journey some years ago, I meal prepped a few meals every couple of days. It really helped me not make poor eating choices when I had healthy food ready just to be heated and consumed. But best advice I can give you is having an open and honest conversation with your husband. ;;;",1553905518.0,b74v1e,t3_b74v1e,16,12,/r/relationships/comments/b74v1e/me_31f_with_my_husband_30m_of_three_years_how_to/,"...Well. Three years after marriage and six years after our relationship began, I've got a nagging suspicion that my husband has started to let himself go. 

It's an old, tired story. But one I admit I've never understood. Why stop caring just because you've been together for any particular amount of time? I don't see the logic.

Anyway, there's a stark difference to me between his lifestyle now and his lifestyle a few years ago. Or even a couple years ago. The change really kicked in after we got married. Not exactly sure what that says, but it can't be anything reassuring.

Quite frankly I've become increasingly frustrated these days over his eating habits. He has lapsed from someone who once ate a normal well-balanced diet, into someone who opts for unhealthy junk food whenever he can. Some days he doesn't eat a single real meal, he'll just graze on packaged snacks throughout the day. Other days it's fast food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Still other days, especially when he gets home from work late sometimes, it's a massive binge of garbage for his dinner in front of the tv because he doesn't feel like cooking. He'll come in, we'll talk a bit, then he carries however many bags of chips and cookies he can fit in his arms over to the couch where he plops himself down to gorge for several hours until we go to bed. I find this incredibly unattractive. Not to mention he sometimes gets horrible gas so then I'm kept up during the night from that.

We both work fulltime and split household duties like cooking between us. I still cook balanced meals with real ingredients like usual. He cooks high-fat foods or just throws something processed in the microwave. I don't want to eat fried chicken or frozen sausage pie or mac and cheese this often, so the effect has been that I've gradually begun doing more of the cooking. Now, I'd be happy to take that on if it meant my husband was therefore eating healthy food more than half the time, but this isn't the case. Even on nights when I've fully prepared a meal and he doesn't need to do anything but eat it, he'll still sometimes decide he doesn't feel like having whatever I made and will order Dominos or Chinese delivery instead. So I feel like I'm now doing extra work for no reason because he won't eat what I make and also won't cook decently healthy meals himself. It also just makes me feel unappreciated when he blows off my efforts to stuff himself with crap. Not to mention the waste of money.

We also have a two year old child who's now at the age where she can express food preferences and figure out what things are treats that we only permit her occasionally, like ice cream and candies. I'm getting concerned about her picking up on my husband's dietary habits. She's already started asking for whatever junk he has when she sees him eating it. 

Then there's our sex life: it's pretty much gone. Because of all the weight he's gained, he no longer wants to have sex much, and the physical logistics are very difficult anyway. In a way this is okay with me as I don't find his body attractive like this, but I still wish in a general sense that I had the kind of sex life we used to have before all this. 

A final problem is his appearance. He's so large now that his old clothes don't fit properly but he persists in wearing them. With pants he's out of luck and needed to buy new ones, but some shirts he'll still try to squeeze himself into and they'll ride halfway up his belly. It's very embarrassing to be in public with him like that. Plus there are very few flattering pant styles for men of his size, so a lot of the time he's just wearing sweatpants. Then on top of these things is the fact that his hygiene has slowly but steadily gone down the toilet. He showers maybe twice a week. Sometimes if I nag him enough he'll shower every other day, which I'm fine with. But I don't want to have to nag. If I don't remind him to shower he'd go a whole week without and by that point his hair is very unkempt and greasy, and his BO is horrible. I've tried to ask about why this has become such an issue, since he used to have no problem keeping up his hygiene. He just says washing himself is ""a hassle,"" ""annoying,"" and ""a waste of time."" He used to like the feeling of getting clean after a hot day and never complained about basic hygiene routines. When he does wash, he often will still smell faintly afterwards, so I don't know if he's even doing it thoroughly. The overall impression that he gives off here is a man who looks very sloppy and like he doesn't care. To me, that's a really unappealing attitude in a partner. Again, I don't know what it was about having a ceremony and a legal document that triggered this change but I don't like it.

Between the unnecessary extra spending, poor influence on our daughter, and how indifferent he is about his health and the way he looks, it's obvious I need to talk to him about the subject of his weight. On some level I wonder if he secretly regrets getting married and that's why he doesn't think he needs to care anymore. I can't think why this would be - he hasn't ever hinted at being unsatisfied with our relationship.

Those of you who've had to have a conversation like this, how did you do it? What are some ways to avoid defensiveness from your partner while still being clear it's a problem?

t2_3i36xilc,"Why would someone make an account to msg your sister, why not directly msg you?;;;A few years ago, I made an OKCupid account. This was before they made you use your name, it was just a generic screen name. I didn't put up pictures yet, and was just browsing. My coworker (who had JUST gotten engaged!!!) messaged the account, hitting on me. 

Like... dude was so thirsty and desperate to cheat he was hitting on accounts with no photos or details! At first I was like, oh well.... none of this is my business. Maybe they have an open relationship or something. Not my concern. 

But then at work one day, his fiancee actually came in to see him and he introduced me. Such a nice gal! I sort of chatted with him over the next few shifts and gathered, no, they were absolutely supposedly monogamous. 

I made a fake facebook and messaged her about it. She didn't believe me. I had deleted the account in shock after he messaged me, so I didn't have screen shots. I was also kinda young and naive. They're married now. This was a few years ago, I've  since moved away and don't see either person any more.

I'm not saying you need to take this message as gospel. People can be weirdos and lie and be vindictive. But there is absolutely a chance this is legit. In my case, it was. I still feel terrible for that girl. Maybe she/he couldn't message you due to privacy settings. Just...carefully assess this situation, do a little investigating, follow up for details. Trust your instincts. ;;;I’d tell him what happened when he’s back and in front of you and in this case I think it’s reasonable to just say “can I please look at your phone for 5 minutes?” Let him know it would be a one time thing and you just need proof in your hand ;;;I would take it serious unless there is someone you know that is actively against your relationship. Confront him;;;I had this happen to a friend, except it was her boyfriend getting the cryptic messages. It was saying she was cheating (she actually was... so the info wasn’t wrong).

And like some other user mentioned, by telling your sister, who like you said are very close to and anyone who knows you knows that, instead of you directly, you have your sisters support. 

When he gets back talk to him about it in person. Be as calm as possible. See how he reacts. And I agree with what another user said - ask to see his phone as a one time thing. I think that's a totally reasonable request given the situation you are in. Sorry you're going through this, I'm sure it's gonna make you feel uneasy all weekend. Just try to be calm and assume the best for now;;;How likely is it that someone knows your boyfriend so well that they'd know he uses prostitutes (something you'd want to keep from even your close friends, unless they do it too) also knows who your sister is? Do you still have the same surname? Is it obvious from your social media that you have a sister?;;;Maybe you have some kind private settings on your social media so unknown people can't message you. I, for instance, have a setting that only my friends and friends of friends can message me on specific social media. Fishy accounts like that can't if we dont have mutual friends. And maybe your sister has a more open social media and everyone can message her so the person sent it to her and assumed she would tell you.  ;;;What are the chances your sister wrote it and doesn't have the heart to tell you?;;;the fact that is was anonymous makes it a bit sketchy, and the prostitutes part of it makes it far fetched again, and also, why didn't anon message you? do you have social media? are your boyfriend's friend also in relationships? was you rough patch 6 months in cheating related?;;;Best thing to do is to ask your boyfriend. See how he reacts. If he raises  suspicious more than ask to see his phone there an then.

Saying that, I wouldn't really focus on the fact that the message was anonymous. If you have no reason to believe another person is trying to sabotage your relationship I think you have to take this seriously and address it with your boyfriend.;;;Have you/your sister messaged the account back? If not I would asking for proof. If they can provide proof it will give you more context. If they can’t then I’d chalk it up to being some weird hoax. ;;;Just a message and no other proof? Like a recent screen shot of him on a dating app or messages with an escort?

I ask because that leaves open the possibility that it's not true and from someone who is motivated to break you two up. Like, an ex of his or even your ex, or someone in either of your lives that wanted to be with one of you and was rejected or never made a move, and now you two got together.

Of course, it's also possible that it's true and they're doing you a favor.

You could have your sister message them back, thanking them and asking for more details/proof, and for the three of you to meet up. If they won't do that, then that increases the likelihood that it might be false.

And he's away with college friends, which compounds the issue (true or false). I suppose if it is false, that makes it more likely it's someone who wants to be with him if they knew he would be travelling.

I would wait until he gets home, sit down with him and tell him what was sent to your sister. His reaction will say a lot, and you go from there. I'm sorry there aren't any easy answers.;;;Definitely could be a prank. Very insensitive one if so.

&amp;#x200B;

But I think it is more likely true and the person who messaged your sister is likely a friend of the bloke. I used to be room mates with a guy who cheated on his partners. I could not use my real account to tell them or I'd be looking for a new room mate, but I did want to reach out and let them know (because no-one deserves to be cheated on). So I used fake accounts. Sometimes the relationships ended quite soon after my messages, other times I don't think the girls believed me. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, even though I think it's likely true, I wouldn't recommend asking for his phone to check for cheating. Instead it would be better if you could have a quick snoop while he is in the shower or something. As a very faithful partner I would be somewhat offended at such an accusation, and if he hasn't been doing anything wrong he will feel hurt that you could even assume he would. But I never hide my phone or laptop and my partner has access to it all, so if she ever had doubts all she'd need to do is have a secret snoop and I'd be none-the-wiser. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or if you need his password, just be sitting on the couch together or something and say ""Hey I left my phone in the other room, can I use yours?""

A very innocent man will just say ""Yeah sure""

A confused man might ask ""why?"" This doesn't prove guilt though. If you've never used his phone before he may just be curious what you plan to do with it. Just say you want to check your bank balance or email or something. Once explaining what you plan to do, there should be no reason for him to say no or to say ""Yeah one sec"" and then use his phone (likely deleting evidence). If he gets up, keeps his phone, and goes and gets yours from wherever you left it, pretty likely a red flag. Dead battery is another good excuse if ""left it in the other room"" isn't applicable. 

&amp;#x200B;

If he refuses, huge red flag. I honestly can't think of anything that could be on his phone that is so private his partner of 9 months can't see. So then you need to ask ""Why not?""

&amp;#x200B;

No evidence on the phone doesn't clear him though. He could cover his tracks. 

&amp;#x200B;

So perhaps the best plan of action is to message the fake account and ask if they can prove something. Even if they give a name, like ""Judy"" so you can ask your boyfriend about ""Judy"" and see how he reacts. Any kind of information can help solidify the idea that this is true and not someone playing a stupid prank.;;;I’d ask that anonymous person for proof. You just can’t go on and tell someone is cheating without proof. If they can’t... well I think that person is messing with you. If you know a geek/computer engineer you could probably track where it was sent from. ;;;Do you have any narcissistic exes that just wouldn't quit contacting you after you broke up with them, like ones who'd fit /r/NarcissisticAbuse?;;;Do you have a generic name? This kind of sounds like it could just be a phishing attempt. I would ask for more info but also be cautious about opening any attachments. Ask for more details that would make it clear this is a real person who actually knows your boyfriend.;;;Do you or he have know anyone who would try to mess with your heads? Maybe this is sabotage?;;;Is there any evidence? At all?;;;The fact that this person knows your name, knows your sister and your boyfriend is weird. They didn’t message you directly despite knowing your name. They were anon. Again it’s weird.

t2_3i775vbh,"The thing with a crush is that it feels so much like falling in love. I'm rapidly approaching middle age, and I've only ever been in love twice, but I've felt like I was in love countless times. Only on looking back on it do you realise it wasn't love. Don't act on it, let it fade. Spend less time around your friend's mum, and deal with the hurt (it may feel like a broken heart, but it will ease). I hope you are well, good luck.  ;;;Sometimes when people lose a parent or never had a relationship with them to begin it messes with their development. The things they yearn for the most as they become an adult (like to be love &amp; be loved by someone and to be loved by your parent) be come entangled in their subconscious and your brain has difficulty recognizing the difference between them. Its not an emergency but if you have the opportunity the best thing you can do is find a psychologist to talk about this with. They can help you navigate the feelings, understand where they come from and and detangle your desires. Just like you go to a dentist to get your teeth cleaned to prevent cavities and having to get a root canal, you can go to a psychologist and discuss things that are confusing before you get too caught up in them.;;;I think it’s pretty common for teenagers to have crushes on people who are older &amp; more mature then they are. I’ve especially noticed it with lesbian/bi/pan women such as myself. 

As much as this may feel like love, it really is just a crush. When I was your age I would fantasize about older women, too, because it felt good and I was exploring my sexuality. That’s totally normal and healthy. 

But you’re 15, and she’s an adult, old enough to be your mother. As strongly as your feelings are for her, she does not have those same feelings. As bad as it may feel, that’s actually a good thing. 

Unfortunately, there’s not really anything to be done other than to wait for the feelings to go away. And they will. You’ll find people your own age who you can crush on and fall in love with. ;;;You can't exactly switch off feelings, but you can decide to not feed them. When she's being nice and affectionate towards you, try to remind yourself that it's platonic and non-romantic from her part. That's the reality, which exists despite how you feel.

I used to fall in love with everyone nice when I was much younger. It's nice, but doesn't last forever. I don't mean to sound cynical. Just saying that it will happen again many times in your life, with different people. ;;;This is above my pay grade but for what it’s worth, my opinion is you aren’t falling in love with her. You’ve lost your mother, and in my opinion, in that age, you’re probably looking for something to replace the motherly love that you had and recognizing that you can’t have it, did the next best thing and started to ‘develop feelings’ for her. I think your best course of options is to recognize that you don’t really love her, she probably remind you of your own mom or something motherly and that’s what you fell in love with. I’m sorry for your loss, by the way. This isn’t exactly normal but it’s a perfectly fine coping method if this is what happened, you just need to recognize that you aren’t really in love with her and all.;;;Your 15, there's nothing you can do. ;;;You should spend less time around your Mom's friend and spend more time with people your age. ;;;Just don't.

Ill preface this by saying hes the most lovely supportive person and i dont regret marrying him for a second. We generally have a great relationship and are very close. That being said, i dont like this situation and im not sure how to fix it.

When we first met out sex life was fine, not incredible or anything (we didnt really experiment or do anything different. My husband was a virgin when we met so i expected there to be little experience which isnt a big deal) but we at least had it semi-regularily (2-3 times a week) and it was fine! 

Over time that quickly changed, and we went from 2-3 times a week to sometimes going a month or more without sex. This has been going on for the majority of our relationship. We still touch, kiss, hug a lot it just never leads to sex. He almost never initiates and doesnt get the hint even if i literally grope him. We talk about it and he says he does want sex and get ""horny"" but we just dont have it. I know he doesnt watch porn because i never leave the house since im from another country and have no car/dont work outside of home so thats not the issue. 


This was a problem for me and weve spoken about it many times but nothing really changes. There are several circumstances that i assume contribute to this.


One, we both work long hours and high stress jobs. We also got a pet that was high maintainance a few months ago which was draining even though we love him. Because of this were generally both really tired and dont have a lot of free time. Personally id rsther have sloppy sleepy sex than none at all though.


Two, him and i used to both be avid gym goers almost every day. When we met, circumstances and laziness plus eating out kicked in and we both gained a pretty significant amount of weight. We both insist that we are still very attracted to the other person (this is definitley true for me, and i trust him when he says it about me). My husband claims im not the problem, he is, and that he hates how he looks now and is extremely insecure about it which kills his sex drive. This obviously plays into each other, because if he has no drive he doesnt pursue me and it makes me more insecure.

Three, he doesnt typically last long. I know this embarasses him. I tell him its ok and have suggested that there are ways to ""improve stamina"" which he can research if he wants but i tell him its not a huge deal. I can only assume this makes him more insecure.


Now comes my problem with all of this. Im very much of an ""identify problems and solve them quickly type of person"". I see these things happening and affecting our relationship and we talk about it a lot, but the issue is it never goes anywhere for him. My husband on the other hand is an ""avoid things until they go away"" type person. I suggested he try therapy to address some of his insecurities (although i dont look my best, it doesnt destroy me inside like i think it does for him and i think he really needs to talk to someone about it). I suggested we go back to the gym or he go alone but it doesnt happen. Ive built a mini workout room in our house and he doesnt use it (i genuinely am not bothered by the extra weight he has put on, but it clearly really bothers him). I suggest we try something new in bed and try to tell him what would help me get in the mood but ultimatley hes always too tired or unmotivated to try anything. Im not sure if hes scared to approach me or just lacks the experience to know how as well.


Im sort of at a loss because i feel like ive communicated everything i can to try to help the situation and dont know what else to do. The lack of sex is hard, yes, but the lack of self confidence he has right now is a much bigger issue and i want to help him before it gets worse but i dont know how. It clearly spills over to other areas of his life because i can see it depressed him and so he has little ambition for other things as well. 


Maybe im doing the wrong things or maybe im not approaching it right, i dont know. Advice?

jfc

so in other words he does things to disrespect your personal space and comfort, and then when you get upset he attempts to emotionally manipulate you by acting like a victim. he doesn't want you to break up with him; he wants to break down your boundaries and control you. take him at face value and ditch him.;;;&gt;yelling, name-calling, grabbing me awkwardly and doing things like pinching, twisting, etc

A lot of that is veering into abuse territory. It does seem like he’s making an effort to control your behaviour but to what end I’m not sure. I think you should take him up on his suggestion. ;;;Wow, he has to grow the f up. He's 28? Geez.;;;Ugh just dump him. *I* hate him just having read this post. ;;;&gt;I don't know if he's trying to get me to leave him or what.

He's testing the waters to see what he can get away with. He wants a girlfriend he can yell at whenever he needs to blow off steam, and whose pain is entertaining. He feels powerful when he makes you uncomfortable and upset and you fail to leave him because 'love'.

Please stop bending yourself into pretzels trying to find a 'reason' for why he's doing this. He's doing this because he's a borderline abusive jerk. Dump him with alacrity.

&gt;Whenever I ask him to stop these things, however, his reaction is to get all mopey and say things like ""you don't love me anymore"" and ""you hate me""

I mean, he's literally asking ""will you still love me if I insult you and physically hurt you"". So far your answer has been 'yep!'. My answer would have been ""If you insult and hurt people, yes, they're going to hate you. I don't understand why this is a surprise."";;;It doesn't matter whether he is doing it on purpose or not. It looks like he's bad at communication and when you talk to him he just shuts you down. If someone shuts you down, it's from emotions and not logic, you can't try to reason with him. The effort and stress from this kind of relationship, especially from a 28 year old adult, isn't worth it.;;;oh please-is he 12? Bc he acts like he is 12.

Why would you put up with someone getting their jollies out of physically mauling you and calling you names?

DTMFA;;;He sounds like a lot of work. I say just move on. He may want to break up with you but he himself does not even know it. I say don't wait for him to figure it out. He sounds physically and emotionally draining, like a toddler. Except, unlike a toddler, he will probably never grow up.;;;Sounds like he might be testing his boundaries to see how far he can go, be careful, behaviour like this can turn seriously abusive in a moment once he thinks he knows how far he can go and still control you. Otherwise he could just be being an ass, time to get explosive, tell him to cut the shit and treat you with some damn respect or it will be over.;;;He needs reassurance of your love. Instead of doing something mature like, I don't know, asking for a hug or something, he does this stupid dance where he does something annoying, you get annoyed, he catastrophizes, you guys bicker, and then when you DON'T break up with him, he feels soothed by the attention and the fact that you're still there.  Like, he's getting off on annoying the shit out of you and then basking in the glow of the fact that you still love him.  

This is something that little kids do - act out and throw a tantrum to get attention they crave because they can't ask for it.  

You should break up with him - not necessarily because that's what he wants, but because he's no where near mature enough to be a good boyfriend.  ;;;If you want to break up with him go for it. Honestly, if you have tried talking to him about this in multiple occasions and he still doesn’t stop then I’d reconsider. Try again. Try to really talk it out and if he doesn’t put effort into it then he’s the problem not you. Him putting in effort to not annoy you isn’t a hard thing to ask of him and if he fails to do it better to leave the relationship now before he actually hurts you with this kind of behavior in a more serious manner. ;;;Dear god, he is a child.

I kind of laughed off the abuse thing and just thought those people think everything's abuse on reddit. Welp, maybe ~6 months or so after that, he DID start doing emotionally abusive things, including telling me my shorts were too short (he'd been fine with them before), saying how he thought random girls walking down the street were attractive (I honestly don't care if he finds other people attractive, and I'm bi, so I'd often be like ""yeah, she IS cute."" Then he'd get annoyed and try something else.), telling me that my butt was ""flat"" and being aggressive towards my cats. This all occurred over a few months, and I called him out every time, told him his behavior was immature and not appropriate, etc. After it became clear he wasn't going to stop, I left him. Then came the incessant messages and stalking behavior (e.g. leaving an unsigned birthday card for me that was clearly in his handwriting).

t2_15tdb7,"Please go to a therapist!! You are torturing yourself over an unbelievably minor infraction that occurred as a result of OVERWHELMING stress and pain. You were in (are in?) a relationship with a person who refused to provide even basic love and care after the death of your mother. I agree with another commenter who said this anxiety is communicating that something is very rotten in your dynamic with your boyfriend. I’ve been in a similar situation and I wonder if you are abusing yourself to distract from the fact that your boyfriend is actually the one emotionally abusing you? Remember that life is long and complicated and these reddit idiots who scream from the rooftop about “Cheating” as if it’s the end all be all of human depravity are wrong. You did NOTHING WRONG LITERALLY NOTHING. you need help, and, I suspect, a partner that doesn’t punish you for having needs and feelings and autonomy. Sending you love. ;;; Was it cool to hold this guy's hand while you were still in a relationship? No. But there's no reason to beat yourself up about it forever. You immediately broke up with your boyfriend, and you feel guilty about it. Those are good signs for not repeating the problem. I think the people that tend to get lumped into the ""once a cheater"" category are those that continue on in their relationship as if nothing was wrong, feeling no remorse for betraying their trust. I think that is a hard mentality to shake. I also think anybody is capable of making a bad decision, and it's how you handle it afterwards that determines how you will go forward in life. I personally don't think you'll cheat again, based on how strongly you reacted to this instance. I think you do need to be careful, to make sure you're not using feelings for other people as a catalyst to ending your own relationship. You need to be able to decide on your own that your relationship is over. ;;;Once a cheater always a cheater is an incredible oversimplification of human behavior. It’s for people who believe in fate and destiny- it’s witchcraft as far as I’m concerned. 

If you had come here with a long history of relationships where cheating was a pattern, I’d have a different opinion. You’re in control of your choices and behavior and you’re obviously critiquing your own behavior and attitudes. But one mistake doesn’t make you a cheater anymore than boiling water makes you a chef. It’s just reductive and soft-brained thinking. ;;;You two were broken up. You didn’t have any obligation towards him. The saying “once a cheater, always a cheater”, is only true if you make it true. I hope that makes sense and hope you have a good day. ;;;IDGAF if I'm downvoted, but ""Once a cheater always a cheater"" mentality is for children who don't understand life or people. I have yet to see someone make that comment who is over 30. ALL people make mistakes and do stupid hurtful things. Part of becoming a better person (and an adult) is learning from those mistakes and taking steps to ensure they don't happen again. 

Yes, you made what you see as mistake, although I think that is debatable based on the background you provided. But for every supposed 'next time' in your mind, you have a *choice*, every single time. You have a choice where you will be reminded of how you feel now, wracked with guilt. You have a choice of where and how you interact with other men while you're in a relationship. You have a choice of how long you will stay with someone you are no longer mentally committed to. 

It sounds like you have learned a harsh lesson about yourself, but that you did learn it. The only thing that you can do is move on and resolve that it won't happen again. There is no sense in continuing to punish yourself. ;;;Girl. You recognized the thing with your coworker could get into heavy territory and took the appropriate steps (ie breaking up with your boyfriend). Holding a coworker's hand is definitely a symptom of an unhealthy relationship, but you realized that already. You were broken up when you slept with this dude, and your boyfriend has already moved on about it. Holding hands is not the end of the world and it doesn't make you a bad person. You already dealt with this in the best way you could, now it's time to let it go.;;;Cheating is a choice. It’s not a tsunami wave that just overtakes you it’s something you choose. Don’t choose it. See how easy that was. Many times we choose to complicate things much more than they need be. ;;;I think the posters saying you didn't cheat are doing you a disservice:

&gt;And walking to my car at the end of the night, that same coworker that my boyfriend initially mistrusted took my hand, and I found myself holding his back.

To clarify for anyone who didn't read carefully, this was before they had broken up. One could argue that holding hands isn't very egregious, but the fact that she was receptive to this shows an openness to cheating.

**With that said:**

&gt;I will never forgive myself for that.

To go against the grain, I think the fact that you recognize this as a breach of your relationship's boundaries is indicative that you're not doomed to be a cheater forever. You didn't uphold the boundaries of your relationship in this moment (and likely before, given that your co-worker thought you'd be receptive), but that doesn't mean it can't be something you learn from. In the future, you now have the benefit of experience in recognizing when these boundaries are being crossed, and as long as you do what's right moving forward, there's no harm done.

Even better:

&gt;He essentially said “I told you so,” but moved on with an ease and forgiveness that shocked me. He still doesn’t know about the night I held that guy’s hand.

Your boyfriend has shown growth from the situation, which is awesome for everyone involved. I would recommend that you tell him about the hand holding incident, and go from there. It sounds like, if he's really gotten back on his feet, you guys could be on the path to something positive. Embrace that.;;;Were you or were you not broken up during the affair?  If so, you didn't cheat.  If not, you cheated.  

Are you always going to be a cheater (assuming you cheated)?  For some people, the answer is yes.  For others, no.  But you will always be a person who cheated, unfortunately.;;;So this isn't cheating at all. You tried to break up with a person who was making you miserable and he manipulated you into staying. You held a guy's hand. That's not cheating. I would go so far as to say most kisses wouldn't even be cheating, even though most would say it's a betrayal of trust. I think it amounts more to insecurity and fear that the potential exists for their SO to have a relationship that isn't their own. But I digress. 

Sex with a third party outside of your current and active relationship... That is cheating. He was in a relationship and had sex with you. He cheated. You ended things BEFORE you slept with him. Had you not chosen to go back to your BF you would potentially still be single. You did not cheat. Period. You are morally in the clear as far as I can tell.

I duo want to say though that your BF sounds like absolute poison though. Depression is one thing but he has been manipulative, implanting negative associations to isolate you, and trying to control you. At least that's what I gather from your story. It sounds like every case of mental and emotional abuse I have ever been in contact with. This includes the times I have been abused similarly. I feel that you are in an abusive relationship. I know you love him but someone has to say it. It was an internet meme but it's true: ""All the red flags, while you're looking through rose colored glasses, they just look like flags."" 

I know I am just some guy on the internet, so my opinion is minimal at best. However, you didn't do anything wrong. You did things in a morally and socially acceptable order. You didn't betray a trust or prove him right. You didn't fail anyone or act in a shameful manner. You were and are a good person based on this story. The only thing I worry about with you is your current relationship. People should be happy before initiating or reinstating a relationship or the happiness becomes a codependency and ultimately leads to resentment and abuse, which I feel is where you were with your BF at the start of this tale. 

I want to hammer this home though so let me say it again. You did not cheat. You acted as honorably as anyone could. You are enough, you are not a bad person, and you did not cheat. Those are truths. They are not dependant on any future actions and nobody overanalyzing or manipulating the perspective can change those truths. That is my opinion. 

Take care OP, you are in the right.;;;There are people who cheat constantly. There are people who cheat once and never again. Everyone is different, and circumstances are different, and people change and grow constantly. 'Once a cheater always a cheater' is a childish and black and white sentiment that just doesn't apply to most humans.

I've never cheated, but I've been cheated on a few times. One is a serial cheater. The other cheated once and met the love her life while cheating on me, and we're still friends. ;;;You are not a bad person. And while  you're worried about being a cheater, I'm feeling sad that while you were grieving the sudden death of your mother, you had to hand hold a boyfriend who sulked that his broken phone under warranty wouldn't magically repair itself without him bringing it to the repair shop.  And that he also berated you about a guy you worked with because he fixated on that instead of, well, being kind and supportive to his girlfriend who unexpectedly lost her mother. 

At a time when a loving caring partner would be trying to help you, he was trying his damnedest to get you to focus on him.  

Your anxiety now is your brain saying ""my bf is going to use this against me for the rest of my life, no matter how much of a hair shirt I wear, now matter how much penance I do for holding that guys hand, I will pay the rest of my life."" Listen to that anxiety. ;;;Don't let me bog you down. There is plenty of cheating that's completely justified. For example, if someone partner was threatening to kill them of they leave, and they confide in another, technically they're cheating. If a wife was being beaten by her husband daily, and she cried to a friend that can be considered emotional cheating. 

A lot of the times, a relationship is already dead before it's ""officially"" dead. And plenty of times, a shitty partner does not deserve the courtesy of an official ""breakup"". 

Cheating is wrong in most cases, but like many things in life, it's not exactly black and white, as seen from your situation.  ;;;You always have a choice. Just make the right ones for now on   Seems like you learned a valuable lesson. ;;;I agree if it was as you said in this, but you left a blank of between the hand holding incident and the two weeks later.  Did you clearly breakup with your boyfriend to him?  And If so did you breakup with him because you gave up on your relationship right then and wanted to sleep  with this other guy.  Breaking up with someone because an even primarily  feeling of, ""I felt ready inside I was just done."" If your epiphany or aha moment happened at that moment then you did exactly what this navy guy did, but you caused significant emotional stress and a. Wake-up call to your partner considering the breakup didn't last as long as breakups last for most long-term relationships in my opinion.   Judging yourself as morally superior to this other guy is where your wrong... He wanted to. BE sure  it was worth ending his relationship over, and obviously it wasn't cause you went back to your SO after you got your rocks off. At least your cheating on your  SO is broadcast now so he knows when ""your done "" and gonna sleep with his arch-nemesis.  Or it was a clear breakup but maybe your feeling like you broke up to be romanced by another and not for these interwoven reasons of my boyfriend's depressed but really is controlling or abusive but you really don't believe that's why, you broke up to be romanced by someone new at that moment of hand holding?  If you broke up to be romanced and  cheat guilt free mainly and the other stuff is bs, (only you know If it is), call it for what it is .;;;At best, you started moneybarring your way into another mans bedroom while in your relationship.


I think you cheated, but on the scale of cheating... you could have done a lot worse....stayed in the relationship and lied about it
;;;Yup, gotta be honest with you here! You did cheat.. So you're a cheater;;;Jeesus, your young, you didn't murder someone. Just let it die. Be single awhile, maybe? You're waaay too hard on yourself. ;;;Here’s the thing, maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but, if you cheated once obviously cheating is a valid option in your eyes and there’s a chance you’d do it again. Relationships will always have ups and downs, but you can’t just cheat every-time your partner gets on your nerves. If it’s really that bad you should just break up with your partner and then you can be free. But you made a commitment to be monogamous with someone and then turned it all into a lie. That’s weak moral character. you can blame it on whatever you want but you had all the agency here. Instead of trying to fix things in your relationship you decided to get emotional/physical validation elsewhere not caring who you hurt. You had a choice then and you have a choice now. Just be better. ;;;I actually do think the ""once a cheater, always a cheater"" thing is true. I think it might mean for you that if you're ever unsatisfied with a relationship but haven't ended it that you will have relatively low resistance to cheating if the opportunity arises. There solutions though. First, just end things if you're unsatisfied. Second, insist on non-monogamous relationships. Third, just resolve not to do it again and see how it goes.;;;So I had an abusive husband who always somehow manipulated me into staying every time I tried to leave him. I cheated on him. He forgave me pretty quickly but 8 years later I still haven’t forgiven myself. I’ve been in 2 relationships since then and when the last one got bad I had a few opportunities to cheat but it wasn’t even a thing I considered. We opened up our relationship and I still had a hard time with the idea of being with someone else. 

You’re not a cheater. I don’t even believe you cheated in this instance. You were in a toxic situation and you got out of it. Even if you had cheated, I believe for you it would have been a singular occurrence. Love is a verb and it’s about choosing your partner. You always have a choice and it doesn’t sound like you’d ever choose to cheat. ;;;You were single. 

People who are in relationships cheat when they cross a boundary with another person. ;;;Man, you almost convinced a lot of people that it was your boyfriend's and the other guy's fault you landed on someone else's dick in the relationship.

That's why it is plainly obvious you're gonna do it again (to this guy no less): You spent 80% of the post talking about how it's their fault and they're assholes.  Combine that with your desperate need for attention and place of employment... yeah, break up. This guy deserves better than you.;;;Well you did cheat, so yes you will always be a cheater simply for having cheated in the past, that's a reality you are best to come to terms with because no matter how anxious you get you cannot change the past. ;;;",1553871269.0,b6y95m,t3_b6y95m,72,24,/r/relationships/comments/b6y95m/i_f21_had_a_fling_with_a_coworker_f25_that/,"Sorry, this is going to be long.

First and only time anything like this has ever happened to me, but things like “once a cheater always a cheater” have me pretty much freaking out inside on a daily basis.

So my longtime boyfriend and I have been dating on and off since we were 16, and have been through a lot together. Definitely a situation where we are watching one another grow up, with all of the twists and turns and rises and falls that that process entails. In October, November, December of 2018, his depression that has been a large challenge for both of us intensified greatly, and he became extremely outwardly pessimistic and negative about everything. (Small example—he has a warranty on his iPhone. It started malfunctioning. He told me about the answers with an attitude that was essentially like, “Whoop-dee-doo, yet another reason my life is straight trash, add another L to the pile.” I suggested he bring his phone to the Apple Store to get the warranty honored, he brushed me off and said “Why bother, they won’t even honor it. All those people are scam artists anyway.”) He lost any motivation to get up and help himself, and instead was letting his work and social lives collapse while talking about how he was cursed and just not destined for success, and that his dreams would never come true.

It was a lot for me to bear. I had just lost my mother after a short battle with brain cancer in September, and was trying to break through the extremely traumatic anguish and and anxiety attacks I had experienced throughout her treatment. I threw myself into work and friendships, and things really did start getting better, except in my relationship, in which I was essentially a fixer and a caretaker. I was the one who took the phone to the Apple Store, and other small things like that really began to pile up on me. He refused to come out and meet my friends, and began belittling me for “spending all of my time at a bar” (I work at a bar. I have never struggled with alcoholism or any other addiction issue, it was just a familiar physical space full of people I know, who had really helped me through things while I was helping him). 

He also latched on to this strong hatred of a particular male coworker, who he said was “definitely into me” and “I bet you like him more than you like me” and “I just knew it, I’m so boring and unintelligent to you, you talk about your real interests and passions with that guy and I’m just a friend you fuck”—the dude was a former Navy officer and USNA employ, was interested in military history (my college major) and books, we would chat about those things throughout the shift. My boyfriend really would not let it go though, and was constantly hammering into me trying to get me to admit that I thought he was “too boring, uninteresting, unintelligent.” He had become really convinced of those specific things for some reason, and I disagree with all of them. I think he’s a thoughtful, bright, brilliant person with a science-oriented mind that mystifies and excites me. We don’t have the same interests, but learning new things is one of my biggest passions, and he always has something interesting and perspective-changing to offer in a conversation, as opposed to the same old shit about Thucydides I’ve heard a thousand times.

I tried to tell him this and more, but he wouldn’t listen to me. I started to feel resentful, put-off, I don’t want to say disgusted but just extremely frustrated and disappointed. I know that depression is an illness and he was not well, I still feel a lot of guilt about those emotions. At the end of November I attempted to seriously break up with him. I laid down all of my honest feelings as to why the relationship was not right for me, but he was so upset and... I folded. We stayed together, except that I had mentally checked out. Two weeks after that things continued to be really painful and negative, I continued to feel unheard. And walking to my car at the end of the night, that same coworker that my boyfriend initially mistrusted took my hand, and I found myself holding his back. I will never forgive myself for that. I did break up with BF promptly, and he had been sending me pretty manipulative texts all night, so I felt ready inside. I was just done.

Two weeks after that I slept with my coworker. It was the end of December. I found out he had a girlfriend/an LDR. Still, while he had just slept with me. I was shocked, and told him he needed to break up with her, and that it wasn’t fair that he had done that to her. After I had just held someone else’s hand while still in a relationship. I feel so mixed up and confused about this time. I wish I had reacted more strongly, and kicked him to the curb, but I didn’t. I felt like he genuinely cared about me, and fucked up as it is I think he actually did. But for me, I knew I could never feel romantic attraction towards him, especially knowing he had physically cheated like that, but
mostly because, he wasn’t my ex. (...) I ended up cutting all ties with him. This was such a messy and shameful episode in my life.

A month after that, my boyfriend reached out. He had quit the job that was making him miserable and found a new one that he liked. Had enrolled for the Spring semester and started taking classes again. He said he was sorry, and that he missed me and loved me, and was seeking help and didn’t know how things had ever gotten so bad. I love him more than anything, and we got back together. I immediately began having extreme anxiety daily about my fling with my coworker, which in my mind has become an affair and full blown cheating on my boyfriend, even though we were broken up. I told him about the sex right away. He essentially said “I told you so,” but moved on with an ease and forgiveness that shocked me. He still doesn’t know about the night I held that guy’s hand. And now I wonder if cheating is programmed into me, like I don’t react to things that clearly aren’t okay, like coworker holding my hand, the right way. Like what if I have wandering eyes forever, what if it happens again. I feel extreme worry towards the future because I don’t know what will happen, who I will meet, how I will feel or act. I feel extreme guilt about what happened and never, ever want to do anything like that again. But it’s like I don’t trust myself to act on my own morals anymore.

And you should definitely spend time with your friend, if that's what you're going to do.

My girlfriend was a functioning closet alcoholic. She would drink a water bottle worth of vodka a day. I found out when she stopped drinking for 2 days during a tough mudder we did a year ago. She had a seizure in my kitchen and I spend the next week visiting her in the hospital while she detoxed. It was only 2 month old relationship but I decided to stay with her (Cared about her and thought I could help her get her life on track).

 As soon as she was released she started drinking again. She didn't really think she had a problem just liked to drink because she got bored easily. After she had another seizure and with my objections she wanted to get sober but was to afraid to stop drinking again because she didnt want to have another seizure. We tried to slowly cut down her drinking to avoid the them but she ended up having more and I told her she needed to stop drinking (full medical detox) or I was gone.


 We checked her into the hospital near me in NJ to detox and for a week she detoxed and got sober with me visiting every day after I drove home from work in NYC (where she lives and we both work). I had a Europe trip I had planned more than a year in advance with friends shortly after she was scheduled to be released. When she got out, I was going to fly to Europe the next day and my parents agreed to let her stay with them and help keep her company and get to the bus to take into NYC for work while I was away. She got sober and has been sober since 6 months + and I am so proud and happy she did. 

I want to make it clear she is genuinely a kind and sweet person who is loving and I love her. My family including extended relatives, grandmother, and parents all love her. My mother and her text and my mom taught her to knit during those 10 days they lived together and they spend time together. A year may not seem like a long time to some but I started living with her 2 months into the relationship and it has matured much faster than any relationship I have ever had. I have been thinking marriage and children are in the next 5 years for us. 

In any case. When this final detox was going on I told my one of my best friend, who also abused alcohol in college about her alcoholism to vent and to ask her what I should do. I told my girlfriend that I did this but didn't go into detail about my college friend (lets call her J) and how J was an alcoholic. She didn't appreciate that I told my friends about this but I don't want to lie about what is going on in my life to friends especially when it was something this serious. Also J was a real support and helped me understand the difficulties of alcoholism. 

Fast forward 6 months. We have had arguments like any couple but she had kicked me out of her apartment once before over a fight. I live with my parents (typically 1 day a week) when I'm not with her in the apartment but I spend 6 days there. Basically I visit home so I can use the laundry machine and eat with my parents once a week. But I consider living together.

J texted me 3 days ago and told me she was in the ICU with liver failure and didn't know if she was going to live. She had cut back her drinking from college but lately had relapsed to heavy drinking causing her liver to fail. Anyway, the next day when I came back from my parents I told my girl friend about J. I am obviously upset and worried about J but it also reminds me my girlfriend did some serious harm to her body during the years she drank healthily before me. She was supportive and said how that sad but when I told her J was an alcoholic and that''s why her liver failed she got upset and started questioning why I never told her that J had abused alcohol. I thought I had told her but said I guess I didn't sorry but one of my best friends is dying and I'm worried/sad looking for support. She just kept asking me why I didn't tell her about that and how I should have told her bringing up the fact I told J about her alcoholism and got really mad. I asked her why she was suddenly making this about her and she LOST IT. She started yelling OH THIS IS ALL ABOUT ME?! and just got madder and madder. I honestly didn't know what to say and just tried to defuse this situation by saying idk what to say to you and, my friend is dying and you're yelling at me. This made her even madder and she told me to get the fuck out. (this is 9:30 pm and I was naked in bed ready for bed, as I wake up at 5 am for work). She was so mad and she said something to the effect about how I should go there and why the fuck am I here and Im a bad friend and just kept yelling to get out. I honestly was so shaken I had no idea what to say and was just upset she was yelling at me after I told her about J. Finally, as I was packing my laundry basket full of my cloths while she was just there yelling at me I screamed STOP YELLING AT ME. She just said again get out. 


This was on Thurday night and I just don't know if I should try and go back and talk to her about why she was so mad and try to make it work or if I should just take this as a sign she is just not stable enough to be with me. I didn't think of it at the time but when my father said to me if he was told get out of a place where he lived from a SO that he wouldn't come back. 

I love this woman but I don't know if this is a healthy relationship anymore.

Sorry for a LONG story, never thought I would type all this out but I just don't know what to do anymore. It seems like such a waste to end a year long loving relationship over this especially since I do love her and she is a good person. 


If you got this far you are a better person than me.

t2_3i4q55ks,"If you wish to pay your respects to your grandmother then you should go. As far as the rest of your family goes... you don't have to reconcile with them if you don't want to. Be polite if you see them (it's your grandmother's funeral after all and you don't want to make a scene) but keep your distance. Book your own place to stay and your own transportation. Don't rely on them. Pay your respects and then leave.

All of this advice changes, of course, if you do wish to interact with them more and reconcile. All I'm saying is that you can pay your respects to your grandma without going full reconciliation with the rest of them.;;;&gt; I think it is unfair not to go because my grandmother was not responsible for this and travelling a few hours to pay my respects is not much to ask. 

I'm sorry for your loss. I apologise if this is overly blunt, but your grandmother's dead. She no longer cares about ""fair"", and insofar as she wants or would want anything, I'm sure she'd want you to be happy and as unstressed as possible. I can't imagine she'd want her passing to be the cause of **more** difficulty in your life by ""forcing"" you to be around people you don't want to be around. If you feel you need to be there, and that outweighs your concerns about your father, of course go. But recognise it's for **you**, not your grandmother, who won't mind whether you're there to pay your respects or doing so elsewhere. Really think about what physically being at the funeral will achieve, and whether you need to do it.;;;Funerals are for the living. If you go, go because you want to for you, not becaus you think you have to. Because you don’t have to. You’ve been NC with that side of the family for this long, what do you care what they think. It’s not unfair to your GM, unfair would be expecting you to show up and play nice with people who treated you so badly. 

Is there someone that can go with you to help back you up if you feel cornered? Maybe a friend that already knows the situation? At the least if he’s sent you the time/place I’d show up on the dot so no one can corner you before hand. Park separate from others so you can make a hasty retreat if necessary. 

Another option is to go to her grave a few days later to pay your respects in private. There’s no reason to be around people you don’t want to be around. ;;;Your father mentioned your grandmother was talking about you a lot. Was she ill for a while?

This is NOT okay.;;;If there is no one at the funeral you want to see, honour your grandmother in another way.

;;;My condolences.

&gt; How do I handle this?

However the fuck you want!

Trust my, your grandmother no longer cares whether you go to the funeral or not.

So, your decision should be about what will be good for you. If you believe that seeing her and being in her presence on last time before she is put into the ground will help you, then by all means go. If you think seeing your dad will be too traumatic, then don't.

There are many ways you can honor your grandmother's memory. Many do no require going to her funeral.

---

My 2¢ do not let fear (or anger and resentment) of seeing your father control your decision. Fear should only ever serve as a warning. It is there to tell you of potential risk that you have to protect yourself against. In most cases, you can still make the hard choices, just having prepared yourself for possible bad outcomes.

You will like find more closure and be at peace with yourself, proving that you can be in your father's presence. You don't have to forgive him, trust him, or love him. Being able to be in his presence will diminish his impact on you.;;;You don't have to decide right now. And even if you go to the funeral your do not own your family a relationship with them. You can go to the burial, be polite, go home and THEN decide.


Don't let anyone push your boundaries. If your dad has changed he will be patient and give you space. ;;;I'm sorry for your loss. Funerals are for those still alive not the dead. If you dont want to go do something to honour her memory yourself. 
That being said the biggest issue here is your university giving out your cell phone to some random person. I'd be going after them for that. ;;;Sorry for your loss.  

If you want to go to the funeral.....  I have your back!

First, someone else mentioned this.....  book a hotel if you need to spend the night.  Don’t stay with family.   Tell them the wrong hotel.  

Second...  is there a wake?  Before you go in to the viewing, scope out the building for exit doors.  If you can, park near the back door rather than the front.   Go in the building without a coat or umbrella.  Just yourself

As soon as you get in, find the bathroom.  Just excuse yourself and say you had a long drive.  There is often a rear door by the bathroom.  If not, pretend you couldn’t find the bathroom and find the back door.


Most people behave at a funeral so you will probably get out unscathed.  But if they don’t and people are harassing or abusing you?  You found the door.  You brought no stuff.  Out the back door you go!;;;I think you should go. Apparently his side of the family is willing to respect your boundaries, since he’s been keeping track of you from afar but hasn’t contacted you. They’ll probably be able to keep things light at the service.;;;I have been in your shoes and in the end decided not to go to my grandmother's funeral.  It was about five months ago, and it has left me with a bit of difficulty processing my grief.  HOWEVER, I know that if I had gone, there would have been screaming and drama.  I have no idea which would be better.

But the best advice I got - if you do go, arrive at the funeral late and sit in the back.  Then leave right before the end.  Bring an uninvolved friend with you.  This way you interact with fewer people, and still get the opportunity to process.

Internet hugs, for what they are worth.;;;Déjà, désolé de ce qu'il t'arrive...

Pose toi et prends ton temps pour refléchir. Fais ce que tu te sens vraiment de faire, sans te forcer.

TL;DR: basically the title.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, my father called me at work to announce the death of my paternal grandmother. The discussion was short, he didn't ask for any input. He just announced it, said she was talking a lot about me, told me she was getting buried and that he hoped I would come.

&amp;#x200B;

The relationship between my parents exploded when I was 16 and highlighted all the years of emotional abuse and neglect I suffered from both of them. I chose to stay with my mother and to visit my father when I wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

I distanced myself from my father because of all the lies he would pathologically tell, but the final staw was discovering that the reason why my parents were getting a divorce was because he had emptied my mother, my sister and my bank account, which would make 10k€ (roughly 11k$). I cut him off my life and changed my phone number.

&amp;#x200B;

After getting my own flat for my studies, I was able to realize how deep the issue was with both my parents and tried to acknowledge my own feelings.

I ended my studies a year and a half ago, found a job and went VLC with my mother for my own sake.

&amp;#x200B;

I took my afternoon and the day after off because it brought up a lot of things I had buried inside (no pun intended).

&amp;#x200B;

Later, he messaged me the time and place of the funeral, said that my grandmother was at peace and that her passing could help us bonding back.

I asked him how he got my number, and he answered me that he followed my studies path in spite of our quarrels and asked my university my phone number months ago. He added that he only used it in painful cirumstances as I could see, and I could be assured that he would stay in the shadows as long as I wish.

&amp;#x200B;

I am at loss. I don't know what I truly feel and I don't know if I should go to the funeral. My family is very small, I don't think there will be a lot of people there and I don't want to discuss anything with my father.

I don't know what to call such a part. Any ideas? If I can't find such a part I guess I could CAD and 3D print such a part.

Thanks in advance.;;;I’m having trouble finding a particular kind (color, really) of wooden box/bin type thing to use as inserts in my ikea Kallax shelves.

The kallax shelves are about 13x13 on the front and 15” deep. ;;;I want to make a removable arm rest for my dining room table for game night. Its a rectangular table and I'll be using 2x4s and plywood. The plywood will be screwed into the 2x4s, where most of the plywood will rest the top edge of the table, and the 2x4s are around the outside edges of the table. Think of the (plywood+2x4) as an upside L shape that rests on the edges of the table. I will cover the plywood in padding.

Rather than have a large rectangular frame that I can place on top, I'd like to store it away as four separate pieces that I can attach together around the table when necessary. Whats the best way to secure the armrest when needed? I am thinking of using cam screws and locks. And if the table was 60""x36"", should I get two 60"" 2x4s, both with cam screws in them, and two 40"" 2x4s with cam locks? Or should it be an alternating thing where each 2x4 has cam locks on one end and one screws on the other - then this would be two 62"" 2x4s and two 38"" 2x4s

[https://imgur.com/a/oLdu5cA](https://imgur.com/a/oLdu5cA)

It's right in the middle of our home, visible from the front door. Split in half with a coat rack on one side and shelving on the other, covered by two sliding doors. There are four press-release cabinets above the sliding doors.

For the exterior, we are thinking about painting/staining the whole unit white, removing the sliding doors, and replacing them with a custom barn door. I'm unsure about the barn door due to the small space (4"") between the bottom of the cabinets and the top of the closet, as well as there being no stud to drill the hardware into.

For the interior, we plan to cover the sides with shiplap and remove the existing coat rack/shelving. We'll replace the coat rack side with white display shelving for a sound bar, photos, etc., then switch out (or paint/stain) the current shelving on the other side and use it for storage.

How do I go about disposing of this?  I'm assuming throwing it in the dumpster is a bad idea.  Thanks!;;;I'm going to be tiling my kitchen floor.

Joists are 2x12 with 10ft spans and spaced 16"" on center.

I have ripped up all previous floorings and plywood layers to get down to the planks fixed to the joists.

The planks are 1x6x0.75 tongue and groove but the tongues have mostly separated from the grooves and they are run on 45 degree angles across the joists and they actually span closer to 22"" rather than 16"" I have already added a couple screws beside each nail to keep the floor from squeeking when walking on it. However because the tongues have disengaged from the grooves there are still some boards that move a little bit.

I know the proper method to put down flooring would be to remove the planking, add blocking where necessary and put down 0.75"" plywood and then another 0.50"" plywood laid perpendicular to the previous layer. Then optionally tile to the plywood or put down backer board and tile to that.

I REALLY don't want to replace the planking as there is a long edge I would need to block that would basically require a new joist installed underneath my hardwood floor.

I'm HOPING I can get away with just screwing 0.50"" plywood over the planks and tiling over that. A couple different engineers and structural designers I've spoken to say they have done this or even just 0.25"" over the planking and they haven't had any issues in over 10 years.

;;;We're re-doing a bedroom, and we need a door stop behind a door. My girlfriend is terrified that she's going to trip over any options I've found, or perhaps jam/break a toe.

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked into those hinge-mounted ones, but they seem like they'd dent the trim, and also that they don't ""stop on a dime"" which means they nee to hold the door out further, so that it doesn't hit the wall when it bounces a bit...but that's awkward for this door because it's a narrow corridor.

&amp;#x200B;

What kind of door stop would you put here?

She sleeps on that same side of the bed, and is afraid she's going to turn the corner in the dark, and stub her toe on the a door stop here. And because this is an addition, the floor actually ramps down slightly as you pass through this doorway into the room, so whatever we put here needs to be about 1"" taller than a normal door stop...so whatever we use, won't be low-profile.

The thin lighter color tube looks like the pilot tube. This would be the tube that would supply the initial small gas flow for ignition. 

The thin copper color tube connected to the very end of the burner control valve is the thermocouple. It's job is to keep gas flowing as long as it is burning properly. The pilot flame would be directed at the other end of it (inside the little perforated black box adjacent to the burner)

The lighting procedure should as follows;

Push and turn the knob until it clicks. Keep the knob turned and depressed to keep gas flowing. The click sends a single spark to the pilot so it may take multiple tries to get ignition. I would use a long stem BBQ lighter instead and direct it's flame into the box. Be patient, it may take a while to purge air from the lines.

If you can get the pilot lit, keep the knob depressed for a few seconds to allow time for the thermocouple to heat up. Then you should be able to release the knob and turn to start and adjust main burner flame.

I have two pumps and a pretty high water table. They currently discharge by the side of my house and then the discharged water then runs down the driveway and pools at the driveway basin. No good. 

My first step will be installing a brand new check valve on both. One has a very old one and the other one didn't have one at all. So hopefully that will help a lot with the frequency of how much they currently run.

Second, I am going to extend them out, across the driveway and out about 20 feet into a dead and unused area of our yard where water has never pooled during rain. The asphalt driveway already had a channel cut across it from what I could best guess was a dish tv hoop up so that part was made a whole lot easier for me.

First big question is, would it be safe to run both lines into one when I start to pitch downhill? Or just run both lines side by side? They are both inch and a half. Could I run them into a 2inch and not lose flow?

Second, how should I end the run? I am in New Jersey so freezing temps are a concern in the winter. Someone told me just use a 90 degree pop up fitting at the end and leave the top right at ground level. Others have said to keep the end of the run underground. 

If I keep it underground what is the best way to set that up to avoid water pooling in the area or backing back up into the lines?

Someone had just kind of shoved the wires up there and then popcorned over it leaving a mess. After scraping the wires clean as best I could it seems that I have 6 wires up there - 3 black and 3 white. Two blacks and a white are marretted together, two whites are marretted together and then a solo black (see image). I'm installing a simple pendant light (Hampton Bay 674-742) that has one black, one white and a chassis ground. My plan is to connect the black fixture wire to the solo black ceiling box wire, the white fixture wire to the 2 white ceiling box wires, the fixture chassis ground to the screw on the fixture cross bar that goes across the outlet box and to leave the 2 black/1 white ceiling box wires alone.  If someone could confirm this that would greatly put my mind at ease. Thanks!

When you remove all of the laminate &amp; any underlayment, go through &amp; screw down all of your floorboards (every 10-12 inches or so) before putting anything back down.  This will help to have a stable surface &amp; hopefully alleviate most squeaking.  If only a few spots aren't level, you can add a self leveling product made for wood flooring &amp; then lay your product according to recommended install.


If your floorboards are completely unlevel, but you can shim (less than 3 consistently) &amp; use thinner plywood sheets across the whole area.


You will lay the sheets going in the opposite direction of the existing floor, make sure that no joints are over each other (if you have level surface, you might not need it at all).  Screw  (no nails!) &amp; glue it (use the correct expandable/stretchy glue... not a ton) down &amp; level it as needed with thin shims (more than 3 in any/multiple areas, you will need thicker plywood for strength) underneath the plywood.  Make sure to screw through the shim so they don't shift.  


If installing over concrete, you will need to make sure to level the floor.  The easiest way is to use a self leveling product made for that purpose.


Laying parquet (or any floor) is a bit of a challenge in older (aka no straight lines) homes.  Depending on the pattern, you want to start with a straight line &amp; lay out from there.  All of your cuts should be at the hidden areas (under the baseboards/trim molding at the bottom of the baseboard).  


In your case, if you are using it at the top of the stairs, don't lay it based on a doorway or top of the landing.  


Find the center of the room in both directions then measure back to your start area.  You are trying to start with a full section as much as possible, so if it's a 10""x2"" piece of wood, one end of the piece might be the full 2"" &amp; the other 1.9"".  The illusion of a straight line to start is created &amp; the rest of the space does have straight lines.  


This is a bit of a challenge with multiple doorways, but measure/layout/draw a grid multiple ways to get your best layout PRIOR to cutting.  


Depending on how much space you have, you can lay it out dry &amp; you want at least 20-30% more than whatever you think you need.


""This Old House"" is a TV program that's been on in the USA forever.  You may enjoy some of their episodes &amp; they are great about sharing tips &amp; tricks.


I know there are a ton of blogs &amp; videos out that talk about using recycled materials, so you can look for layouts for parquet to get a better idea of your install options &amp; where it's going to serve you the best.

Installation on any floor &amp; over different underlying surfaces gives you different moisture levels &amp; gives expansion &amp; contraction (which you need to allow for accordingly).

I hope the additional info helps!;;;One option would be to put a flooring transition piece (aka sill plate or door threshold) at every door/transition opening.  It would be the width of the door frame, you can customize angles &amp; fit.  It’s also removable when you decide to go back &amp; finish the rest of your floors.



I found this explanation with a quick google search for “sill plate transition between flooring” &amp; quite a few photos popped up too:

This most commonly occurs between rooms, so the ""door threshold"" is often tasked with the job. In most cases it simply adds a third level slightly above both - depending on the design it may overlap, or it may emerge vertically (overlap is better for lousy workmanship - emerging vertically requires that the flooring end or be cut precisely, or it looks sloppy.)

An honest and substantial threshold looks 9 times better than a chintzy narrow piece of aluminum or plastic trim where someone chose to run two types of flooring together and not consider the transition; but that's an opinion (mine.)

For your ""calibrated transition"" make it from wood as an overlap, and cut the rabbet on the high side deeper (think about it until that makes sense.)

The ""vertical"" type is most commonly seen as marble or granite thresholds anywhere from 2"" to 6"" or more wide. Cut out the appropriate section of floor precisely, plunk in some mortar, check the height, add or remove mortar, fine adjust with a rubber mallet, let the mortar set.;;;You want to add 1 1/2"" to a landing? Be aware that you don't want the last step coming up to the landing to be significantly taller than the rest of the stairs.

I've read around online a fair amount but have a couple of questions, if anyone can help. I've read that you need to lay parquet on a solid floor - either concrete or sturdy ply. I've got a few options of where I could lay it but the ideal spot would be the top floor landing which currently has the worst laminate. This is two floors up and while I could lay ply no problem, I'm wondering if there's a reason that I've really only seen parquet on ground floors before. Is the extra movement going to mean it ages poorly?

Secondly, 18mm ply is recommended, then the blocks themselves are maybe 20mm, giving a total thickness (not including glue) of around 4cm (an inch and a half). The current laminate is a few mm thick and laid on top of some thin foam, so the parquet will be a considerable amount deeper. I'm happy to trim round the edges as needed, but potentially there will be a height difference going into the bedrooms on either side. They currently have the same crappy laminate - in future we might get carpet, sand back the floorboards or lay more parquet. It's hard to imagine what a height difference on each threshold would look/feel like. It'd be a couple of centimetres at most but I don't want to realise after installing that it looks awful and means we stub our toes daily. Can anyone offer advice?

There are other areas in the house I could lay it but I'm keen to replace the worst laminate first and most other areas have some decent laminate that we can live with for a few more years.

t2_3m096,"So.... when do you hook it up to a RasPie and have it light in time with the actual phases of the moon?;;;Nice. This will make a great addition to my 2 year olds room. ;;;This is great!  Thanks for sharing, I'm going to start collecting the materials for one today.;;;Hmm. I wonder if it would be more even if there was a frame outside the moon, where you could put the led strip. Point of that is to mount the leds so they dont light the canvas directly. All light is just reflected off the back wall.  
  
Also, since moonlight is in the 4k region, fidning 4k white leds would probably be the closest match. (High cri if you can).

A general rule for using LED tape when creating a light box, run the tape in parallel lines behind the surface to be lit and space the LED lines the same distance the LEDs are from the front surface. So if you space the moon 4"" from the wall, the LED light strips need to be spaced 4"" apart. It will produce a nice evenly lit surface.

Well what if you put some strips of LEDs immediately adjacent to the strip running around the circumference, but facing towards the wall. The light would get a chance to reflect off the wall and bounce around some before difusing through the frosted layer. 


Now if you put them directly on the shower curtain there would be a shadow since the strip itself is opaque. However, if you could suspend them between the curtain and the wall, their proximity to the circumfrential LEDs might make it so there's no shadow.


I'm not sure how you'd suspend them without the rigging making shadows...maybe you could snake them so the LEDs are their own supports against the wall, think like a square-wave shape. I'll think on it and let you know, but if you run with this idea I totally want to hear how you do it!

https://youtu.be/I9MZNEXrElw;;;I have an easy suggestion that might improve the diffusion a little.

Expensive tho.;;;Nice! Good job;;;So, I’m totally going to do this.  The wife and I have a TV room that we’re decorating in a fantasy kind of feel, this will fit in perfectly there.  Someone else had a Death Star as an idea, I might do that, too.  My office is looking very sparse...

Two ideas that fit your approach to diffuse and improve the light.  First, use clear PEX and run the LED strip inside.  Second, before you put your front on and staple it, make a back out of two layers of Mylar.  Think emergency blankets that you can get for like $4 at Walmart.  Wrap the Mylar layer all the way to the front side of the pex, and wrap your front layer of moon shower curtain all the way to the back, pretty much like you did.

This way, you get complete surface illumination and better rear-to-front reflection, which will make the whole thing brighter.;;;A) This is awesome!!

B) That's about it.;;;really cool, wish I had this in my room;;;A staple gun?! No, ""fancy tools"" huh?

Jk, pretty sweet.;;;Can you create a full video from start to finish of how it was done? This is awesome! ;;;Could install and additional pex circle on the back with a 1 inch larger diameter.

I have made myself an LED lit (edgelit) picture frame with pillars of creation. It has a dimmer controller, so I can make it just subtly glow, or light up pretty well, stronger than regular night-lights.

I am trying to figure out two problems. First one is the light bleed around the edges, you can sort of see it in the picture, I am not sure how to evenly diffuse it, making it backlit vs. edge-lit is not an option unless I make the frame thicker, its 1.5"" already. Second issue is the washed out colors, which are not that bad on lower levels, but I get bothered when I crank up the brightness.

I have ordered another poster on thicker full gloss paper hoping it will reduce the washed out colors. I have also put a slight vignetting on it to reduce the edge bleed. We will see how that works in few days.

How its build: 20"" x 16"" x 1.5"" frame for IKEA. Clear acrylic sheet, poster, several filters and diffusers from TV panels, 1/8"" thick plastic sheet also from TV, LEDs around the edges and back plate with reflective white sheet at the end. One note, the LEDs are not shining directly on the edge of the 1/8"" sheet, they are above it. I had to cut it to size making 2 edges murky, they don't pass on too much light making light distribution uneven.

t2_j5yj0,"I built mine with 1 inch clearance at the bottom, then buried a 2 x 6 under that to prevent critters getting into my yard. While there are standards, you can adjust to what you like best ;-);;;The main reason to go 6 from the top, 6 from the bottom, and then split the difference is to avoid noticable warp of the pickets as the wood ages.  As far as I am aware, there really is no standard for your horizontal rail spacing.  I would keep the bottoms 4-8 inches off the ground (few lawns are perfectly level).  If you have to trim pickets to match contour of the lawn, my preference is to take cuts off the bottom of the pickets instead of the top so that you don't have to mess with matching dog ears.  I always use pressure treated, so it's important to brush on some copper green on cut ends.  Cedar can be treated on the end grain and it will last a little longer in my opinion.  A lot of fence building is personal preference.  If you are doing a lot of fencing, or doing it by yourself, I highly recommend building a guide jig so that every post ends up the same, and it helps to hold the boards in place when you start trying to attach them to the posts.  I would recommend a galvanized nail while you are getting everything tacked up and then come back through and put a couple of ceramic coated exterior screws in each board (leave the nails); nails are better for shear loading and screws are better for tensile loading.  I also like to run a third screw through the center of the horizontal at a 45 into the post.  If you don't have an impact driver, it would be a good justification to get one.  When it comes to putting pickets on, I do a similar thing except I tack everything up with 1"" stainless brad/trim nails and then come back through with 3 screws per picket, per horizontal.  (9 screws per picket on a 6 ft fence).  Again, if you're doing a lot of fencing make yourself a jig to space and align the tops of all your pickets post to post, for smaller projects a string line and a spacer block works fine.  A good rule of thumb I have found is 3 pounds per 50 feet of 1-5/8"" screws per horizontal (9 pounds per 50 feet for a 6 foot fence).  I only tack the top rail when I am hanging pickets and then start screws on the bottom rail for two reasons; I can adjust the plumb of the pickets as I go this way, and all the working on my knees is done early in the job.  The next set of screws is the top rail, which on a 6 foot fence is about ete level for me, and then at the end of the job I am left with all the work at waist height, which I find is least crappy when doing a thousand feet of fence in a day.  ;;;You should go take your tape measure and measure a neighbor's fence if you're really that particular.

If your post are close to 8 feet apart I would consider going with 2x6 rails;;;I personally ran a 2x4 pressure treated board along the bottom that my fence boards rested on top of. That way when I’m weed whacking or mowing I don’t need to worry about tearing the fence boards up. Also it helped with all of the fence boards lining up at the top. If your property has a slight grade you can also use this to break it down over a longer distance making it less noticeable.

&gt;Mikhail Lesin, the former Russian press minister who turned up dead in a Washington hotel room in 2015, sustained a fracture to a neck bone just below the jaw line ""at or near the time"" of his death, according to documents released by the city's medical examiner that provide new details about his final days.

&gt;The finding does not provide clear-cut evidence of foul play in Lesin's death; another statement in the documents suggests the bone could have been damaged ""after death"" -- possibly during the autopsy.

&gt;That detail, however, and others contained in the 149-page file released exclusively to RFE/RL offer the most precise scientific description to date about Lesin's death, which officials ruled accidental and said was caused by blunt-force injuries amid excessive alcohol consumption.

&gt;Once a powerful media adviser to President Vladimir Putin, Lesin fell out of favor with the Kremlin elite sometime around 2012 and had lowered his public profile before he was discovered dead in the Dupont Circle Hotel, located a few blocks from the White House, on November 5, 2015.

&gt;The files were released by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, filed nearly two years ago by RFE/RL.

The podcast is hosted by a lawyer and a layman and they go through Barrs summary of the Mueller report and show just how inaccurately the media has been reporting on it. They also breakdown piece by piece the tricky ways in which Barr used legalese to try to spin this in Trumps favor (using very specific language, quoting Muellers report, but starting in the middle of a sentence instead of at the beginning of the sentence)

""Good Afternoon.

""Today, the chairs of six committees in the House of Representatives, in their capacity as the people's oversight over the Executive, submitted our formal requests for the Mueller Report. This request was submitted in the form of a number of subpoenas issued for individuals and documents.

""It is imperative that Congress act without delay to defend our elective process in advance of the 2020 election season. The summary issued by Attorney General Barr confirms again what has been the the unanimous opinion the Intelligence community, that an unprecedented political espionage and disinformation warfare campaign was waged against the American people, that it was successful in achieving its goals, and that the opponents of Western Democracy will almost certainly attack us again, armed with experience and emboldened from our failure to defend the people.

""Congress also has a Constitutional obligation to provide oversight over the Executive branch, including the Department of Justice, the President, and Cabinet officials such as Attorney General Barr. We have respectfully submitted a number of additional subpoenas to allow us to conduct this oversight in light of any new information in the Mueller report and with the understanding that there is a compelling and legitimate public interest that the criminal behavior of the President's administration and campaign has been limited to those indictments and convictions already secured in view of the public.

""We ask that Attorney General Barr comply with the most important request, a release of the complete report to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, without any further delay. We understand the hesitance of the Attorney General to release any potentially sensitive information, but we must stress, it is our Constitutional obligation to provide exactly this form of oversight. Attorney General Barr does not have the authority to obstruct the process of justice any more than the President or any other citizen.""

.

Something like that, I dunno. 

Of course, what would happen next is that A.G. Barr says ""No"" and goes about his business. You can hold him in Contempt of Congress, like A.G. Eric Holder was during Obama's administration, but then you need to hope that the Department of Justice and President decide to prosecute him, which is... *not going to happen.*

Then the best you can get is an Inspector General assessment into things, but we have a gaping hole in our Government where it comes to misdeeds of the Chief Executive and any flunkies he appoints to his Cabinet.

No, apparently it comes from the european immigrants' who had trouble pronouncing Mēxihcah (""*mexica*"") with their accent. It being the name of a native tribe and local valley. Hence the later *Merica*.

What is your goal for healthcare?  Do you support single payer?  If not, why, and what is your proposal then?  In addition, can we discuss the local healthcare market?  See below.

I ask this because being from the area you must be well aware of the pissing match between Highmark and UPMC.  This is despicable and drastically destroying our healthcare.  I had my old college roommate become paralyzed in a horrific car accident in early January.  He is a Highmark customer and UPMC demanded up front payment for his care, and I am pretty sure they refused to recognize the out-of-market rates.  It took his brother making countless calls to get UPMC to keep him there.  He could have gone to Health South, but due to his back being broken in half he required extremely special care and would have needed ambulance rides all the way back to UPMC Presby if his condition had changed.

I'm not sure how often you make your way down here, but UPMC is essentially a monopoly anymore having bought up almost every small doctor's office, hospital, etc in the area.  Highmark is slowly rebuilding West Penn, but their fighting is simply despicable when one considers their nonprofit statuses combined with UPMC being one of the largest state employers and holds the most land in Allegheny County.

So I guess I should tell you a little about myself.

I'm a 28 year old Father who works as a crane operator for AK Steel inLyndora, PA, a little town that slowly grew into the surrounding city of Butler, which is located about 40 minutes north of Pittsburgh.

My mother, who was one of the first women to ever work at our plant, retired in 2013 after 36 years of service, and my dad will retire this spring with more than 20 years.

Each of them served as union representatives at certain points throughout their careers at the mill; though both strong conservatives, my parents engendered in me a respect for working people and an understanding of the importance of collective bargaining.  I have also served as a union representative.

I'm an avid sportsman, and I continue a tradition that has been passed down through the generations in my family; I raise beagles to hunt rabbits. We currently have a 2 year old Beagle named Tom and a pup named Dizzy.  We also have a german shepherd, but he stays home and plays guard dog. When I have time, I'm out in woods and fields two to five mornings a week during hunting season.

That isn’t really that uncommon where we live.

You may have heard people say that Pennsylvania is Pittsburgh and Philly with Alabama in between, or heard our state referred to as Pennsyltucky. I think a lot of people are surprised by just how conservative and traditional life can be in Pennsylvania outside its two major cities, and that is a decent way of describing our town. Blue collar values. Trump voters who might also have voted for Obama. It’s hard to understand unless you live here, I think.

I was not a very politically engaged person until 2016.

My daughter, Evelyn was born in October of 2016, just before the general election, basically. Even though she was born healthy and strong, through a twist of fate a blood vessel in her brain began to bleed, which developed into a stage three intracranial hemorrhage, resulting in hydrocephalus, which caused seizures and lead to a VP shunt being placed.

By the time we were able to bring her home, 40 days had passed. My wife stayed with her 24 hours a day; I was only able to stay with them for the first two and a half weeks before I had to return to work to keep us financially secure. I returned to the hospital after every shift to be by their side.

Today, she is a healthy and happy little girl, not without her own struggles, one of those being a diagnosis of autism, though it is uncertain whether or not that condition is a result of her brain injuries. In all other respects she has a full and healthy life, and we owe our sanity and her presence in our home to the medical professionals at CHP. Her struggles have given me a new insight into the incredible programs our state offers and how important protecting said programs are.

During the time we spent in the hospital, there wasn’t much to do besides research our kiddo’s medical condition, change her diaper, and wait for doctors to round and give us more information.

We also watched a lot of television. As you can probably remember, it was an incredibly tense and bitter situation leading up to the election that year. Our friends and neighbors were insulting each other on social media constantly. It was like the whole country had gone mad. Maybe it has always felt like that leading up to a presidential election, but for us, this was new. I have always had my opinions regarding politics but had not been active until this point. When we made it home from the hospital, we were both determined to make the world a better place for her.

I ran for office in 2018 as an independent candidate, and against a 14 year incumbent who had not faced an opponent in 10 years.  My dedication to civil discourse and respectful dialogue across party lines earned me allies on both sides of the aisle.  More Republicans than Democrats signed my nomination papers.  It was bipartisan support that earned our campaign to fight corruption in Harrisburg more than5000 votes last year.  We earned more votes with less money and less support on the ground than any other candidate in commonwealth, a fact that is owed to the simplicity of our platform and the integrity of our message.  I will work with ANYONE to destroy the culture of corruption in Harrisburg.  I will vote with ANYONE who will help to fix our broken system and to repair our people's trust in what should be their most intimate experience with representative government, their state government.

With that spirit of cooperation and willingness to listen I intend to faithfully represent all people in our district.  I want everyone to feel that they are heard, especially if they happen to disagree with me.

I'm running again for the same office, after my opponent from last year resigned following a rape allegation.

For those who I'm just now meeting out on the campaign trail or online, here's a list of legislation I have promised to introduce/support if elected.

In no particular order:

Strengthen collective bargaining in PA

Increased documentation requirements for per-diem pay

Gift ban

The Judiciary committees should receive the full report, except with redactions for sensitive methods and sources, with Rule 6e information highlighted on one color, and information derogatory to parties that weren't charged highlighted in another color.  Sensitive material redacted should be summarized as best possible.

All other House members should receive the full report with redactions for sensitive methods and sources, Rule 6e information, and the information derogatory to parties that weren't charged highlighted, so they know they aren't supposed to discuss it.  Again, sensitive material should be summarized as best possible.

When they see that the whole damn report is highlighted, it might make them think of how deep the corruption is.;;;Barr saying redactions will be made to people not charged with anything is one of the most bullshit things I have ever heard. 

;;;So an honorable republican was named to lead an investigation into a dishonorable President. The dishonorable president named a sycophant to be AG. That sycophant is the only one who has seen the report and is telling everyone what it concluded. Now the sycophant wants to change the report so he can dictate what others are allowed to see.

Hmmmm...no chance of mischief in that scenario...;;;YES. I would be satisfied if the intelligence/judiciary committees got full, unredacted copies. This is what we need to be demanding. I would love a full public report, but that's not gonna happen. Anything this DOJ puts out is going to be pure garbage. I'm sure it'll just be lots of details on stuff that we already know.

Edit- Schiff has repeated Nadler's demand.;;;He’s right. ;;;It HAS to be otherwise it is a fairytale written by the Trump administration. ;;;If trump’s partner in crime, Barr, gets to read it unredacted, it’s only fair that congress gets to;;;There is literally nothing more worthless than a report on Republican treachery edited by Republicans. Anyone who self-identifies as a Republican is inherently incapable of acting in good faith.;;;You can make an argument that the un-redacted version should not be released to the general public.  It contains classified materials and tactics that don't need to be disclosed.

But there is zero argument that Congress should not get an un-redacted version.  The report was literally written for them.;;;r/release_it;;;Fucking OF COURSE it should. It’s absolute bullshit that they haven’t received it yet!!! 

I feel like I’m taking crazy pills!;;;How can republicans even be against this? Shouldn't we want to prove he's guilty if he's guilty and prove he's innocent if he's innocent? Of there's just a bunch of ""well he did bad shit but it wasn't technically illegal"" then that's not going to change anyone's minds, everyone already knows how they feel about him.

Eat it, Barr.;;;Corruption in the campaign was visible in many ways and the corruption continues in hiding the Mueller report. USA is messed-up AF...unbelievable that one party dictates the rules to the other and meh.;;;It seems to me that the redactions for ""National Security"" reasons would only be EVIDENCE of the crimes.

I/e: Secret deals with Russia are probably a national security concern that would be redacted... also evidence.;;;Once more we hit the snag of the American Experiment: we relied on ""honorable men"" to uphold unwritten rules.  Now those unwritten rules are being disregarded to protect bad actors.  ;;;To Congress, yes. To the general public? Not a good idea.;;;No kidding.

The conclusion of Mueller’s investigation marks the end of an executive branch internal investigation. My guess is that Barr is not going to provide any information to the legislative branch that goes against DOJ policy. And since the president isn’t charged with a crime (and can’t be by DOJ definition) anything related to him will be redacted.  He will tell Congress that if they want this kind of information, they need to do their own investigation starting from scratch. It’s all a stall for time for 2020.  Trump has already started throwing out the chum that will drive his base into a frenzy. 2020 is on, right now, today. The only way to remove Trump is to vote him out. We need to do so in overwhelming fashion. I want the Mueller report seen by Congress, but with Barr in place, that battle is likely just a distraction. ;;;I think this makes perfect sense.

Saudi Arabia is Iran's # 1 foe both globally and regionally and there's no way in fuck that Iran lets them get nukes without trying to get some of their own as deterrence. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can see the situation happening where the US gives S.A nuclear tech and is conspicuously quiet when they develop their own Nuclear weapons, then when Iran starts making moves to make their own, the US uses that as a pretext to either crank up the pressure on Iran, or to straight up attack like the hawks have wanted to for decades.;;;Conservatives: “Dems are too afraid to criticize radical Muslims!”

At this point, it's 88% of Americans, and 75% of Republicans.

Every day that passes more and more Americans become keenly aware that this is a farcical cover-up. ;;;Reps: ""the Mueller report clears the President of all wrong doing.""

Everyone: ""Cool, let me read it.""

Reps: ""YOU CAN'T SEE IT!"";;;The House unanimously voted to release it, only for President McConnell to veto it.  Fuck, why does that one man/turtle hybrid have so much power?;;;They are afraid of the GOP members that are implicated on Mueller's report.  Nunes, McConnell, Ryan, and Rohrabacher have all been investigated by the FBI into their ties with Russia.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFAugsKExNI;;;Why are some Trump supporters so aggressive about their ignorance and/or stupidity?;;;Colluding to hide collusion. Seems about where our government is these days.;;;The Barr Report is a cover up;;;They know the report outlines actual crimes by trump and has multiple
Leads for investigations so they are obstructing as much as they can to
Cover themselves and stack the courts. Unamerican disgusting amoral pieces of shit ;;;We're going to need a leaker. A deeper throat than the original who can get we the people the goods.;;;trump (and republicans) - using the Nazi playbook:

**“Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it.”**—Adolf Hitler

**Reminder** - Hillary Clinton testified for 11 hours before Congress about Benghazi.;;;I don't even accept a 100 word summary about my Daughter's day at school, and Barr thinks we're going to accept 100ish words with fragmented quotes for a summary of one of the most significant investigations in our history?

Release it. In full. Anyone, on every side of every aisle, who assists in hiding it is guilty of Obstruction of Justice and should be tried for treason. If found guilty - the Constitution takes it from there.

Edit: for context, not including the edit, this comment is 76 words and took me 20 seconds to write, 5 seconds to spellcheck and it's one coherent thought with mostly proper grammar. Maybe I should be AG! I'm certainly doing more in my spare time than our current rat does during his workday. ;;;All I ever hear about is McConnel blocking shit. Why the fuck does one senator get the equivalent of a presidential veto??? WHY THE FUCK DOES HE HAVE THIS POWER? It doesn't make any sense.;;;Just tell them it's got dirt on Obama in it.;;;The most frustrating thing is how no one cares about all the people around trump being indicted or investigated or are just in general shitty people

This whole administration is a tree rotting at the roots. It’s irrelevant if the leaves are green, the tree is shit ;;;Why would that be, I wonder? Maybe it doesn’t “exonerate” the very stable Cheeto after all.;;;So you have these guys obstructing justice to push the narrative that trump did not obstruct justice. Weird flex but ok ;;;It seems like it would be a really good idea to widely distribute this report if it ""clears the President"". 

Awfully curious that people like McConnell and Paul are blocking the release...;;;They're stalling for time. They know full well how short people's attention span is, and know that the longer they obstruct, the longer media outlets will state that the report ""exonerated Trump"", even though Barr's four page summary did no such thing. When the full report is finally released, regardless of what Mueller found in the report, people will have already moved on by then. The GOP didn't control the narrative with the media during the Nixon years, and so they've learned their lesson since then.

The first 72 hours were crucial, and they executed to perfection. Every major news outlet kept publishing ""breaking news"" that either Trump had been exonerated, or that the Mueller report found nothing. Republicans knew that by holding out the full report from the public as well as other members of Congress, they could leave a lasting impression that Trump and his cronies had been falsely accused regardless of what was actually in that report.;;;The actions of an innocent party. ;;;Because they are all named in it. ;;;Of course, the longer the GOP stalls this, but also claims it exonerates donald, the longer they have to commit to the report and Mueller as THE truth to this entire affair.  This is a dangerous game for them, because they have now agreed to the truth of the report when the contents become public.

I just don’t know how well this was thought out.;;;Of course they are. This whole exercise has been about Trump and Republicans doing really weird things (like meeting with Putin privately without any other American officials) then expecting us to not suspect something weird is going on. ;;;This is what people with something to hide do.

We're all at least a 60 IQ, we know how that works.;;;And water is still wet, the earth is still roundish and entropy is still the second law of thermodynamics.;;;fucking terrorists.

the republicans are corrupt

they're all Neo-Confederates ;;;They voted for it to be released!!!! Trump said release it!!! And now they block it!!??? Wtf;;;If it’s such good news for the orange asshole, what are they hiding?;;;The Starr report, available day 1
The Benghazi report, available day 1
The Mueller report... redacted,  blocked, not available to Congress 

Note: William Barr is also an Iran-contra figure ;;;Just remember after all of this that we gave Republicans every chance to hold Trump accountable for his actions and they haven't chosen to not only let him off the hook but actively obstruct Justice in his favor. If you ask me, the obstruction of Justice charge can be applied to Republican party as a whole at this point. They have all chosen to be complicit on the chance that they may gain something from Trump in the process.. once we have access to the right information, we may be able to legally bring the whole Republican party to it's knees. ;;;How is it that you yanks manage to get such a high profile and excoriating investigation together, but then your g’ment just turns to you and says ‘nothing to see here’ and you guys can’t do anything. It’s pathetic. Your country is pathetic.;;;Seriously if the Mueller report exonerates Trump like Republicans say then I seriously don't care. Let's just see the goddamn report already, if he has nothing to hide then he shouldn't be scared;;;But this report totally exonerates all wrong doing! WHY ARE YOU AFRAID? ;;;Cockroaches don’t like it when the light gets turned on.;;;I'm willing to bet that if these senators voted to expel Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, and Lindsey Graham a lot of their problems would go away.;;;I really think the dems are missing a trolling opportunity by not asking for the “long form” Mueller report.;;;Wait!  Republicans obstructing?  Trying to obstruct a report on criminal obstruction and collusion with a foreign enemy? (Yes, Russia has been an enemy for years.  See Vietnam, Korea, etc)

Now explain the part where this is surprising.  This all that they have been doing for at least a decade.  They were proud of their obstruction efforts during President Obama's terms.;;;Gaslight. Obstruct. Project.;;;Just subpoena the report. Enough with the fuckin around ;;;Exonerated, my ass.;;;Why would they try to hide the report if he proves that Trump was not involved? ;;;And Congressional Dems are only going to ask for it 47 more times! Just you watch, Pelosi will be very sassy while doing absolutely nothing.;;;Who here is surprised the GOP is obstructing the process to get a report about obstruction?;;;;;;",1553882477.0,b70ikb,t3_b70ikb,1343,45,/r/politics/comments/b70ikb/republicans_are_obstructing_attempts_to_get_the/,,politics,Republicans are obstructing attempts to get the full Mueller report

1. Trump (him and his aides) openly encouraged Russian interference.   
2. Russian interfered.  
3. Trump had investments and interests in Russia he lied about  
4. Since election, Trump has taken outrageous positions directly supporting Putin and benefiting Russia;;;Ken Starr sent six van loads of raw Grand Jury documents congress which they made public two days later. 

Leon Jaworski made no recommendation and sent all of the Grand Jury documents to Congress. 

Memories are pretty short. The Grand Jury testimony in the Hilary Clinton investigation were released and that was just two years ago.

WHAT THE HECK!!?!?!?;;;&gt;‘**This will drive some of our viewers nuts**,’ the ‘Fox News Sunday’ host noted. ‘The Trump investigation did not start with the FISA warrant and Carter Page and the dossier.’

Facts and reality tend to have that effect on the Fox News demographic. ;;;I just can't understand this right-wing logic that you see over and over again--find one bad thing about something, and then you can ignore it entirely as if it never even existed.  

Same thing with Comey.  Oh we found some bad stuff with him so we can ignore everything he ever did as if he was never even born. 

Same with Cohen.  Oh he lied so we can ignore everything he ever said as if he never existed.  ;;;Wonder if Chris Wallace realizes he is a 'token'? ;;;Devin Nunes' own report said as much. Buried at the end it admits that the investigation did not start with the dossier. ;;;How is it that when someone repeat lies a million times, they suddenly become ""true,"" but when the truth is repeated over and over, it is simply ignored :(;;;But the fuhrer says otherwise.. 

What are we going to do, believe our lying eyes??!? ;;;My uncle was going on about this today at work and I shut that shit down hard. I work in a tool warehouse for an industrial construction company, so you can imagine I hear a lot of old, conservative dudes bitching about California all the time, but my uncle straight up peddles lies he saw on some random Facebook page. He's the epitome of the stereotype of know-nothing dipshits that believe everything on FB that confirms their world view. 

On the flip side I work with a younger guy that leans more conservative, mainly because he hates the sensationalism he sees from liberal people/media, and I don't blame him but he ignores a lot of it from conservatives so I'm working on getting him out of that mindset. The best part is that he engages me with the conversation because he WANTS to grow and learn from a liberal guy that leans more centrist on some topics. He likes my willingness to call a pig a pig even if I'd prefer it to be a sheep. While he is kinda hesitant to criticize conservative politicians/talking points out right, if I speak clearly and he picks up on my rationale there's a good chance he will agree with me.

This is what we need to see more of.

Fuck my uncle though, his old uneducated ass needs to lose a few more brain cells so we can institutionalize him.;;;Then the junior college dropout hannity will come on and say the exact opposite.  Fake news;;;Who care s if it did?

The Steele Dossier pretty much checks out;;;And the Carter Page FISA warrant was requested after Carter Page left the campaign.  That also drives Fox viewers nuts.;;;Chris, why don't you corner Hannity in the hallway there at Fox and tell him to stop lying about this (and just about everything else) every day?;;;As a non American, I have to laugh at the fact that these dudes are like ""hey forget about all the other guys that have been indicted and prosecuted because this awesome man here president trump, he was completely clean and did not know that these other guys were doing all this criminal shit to help him"". ;;;Meanwhile- last night during their **prime time slot**-- Rush Limbaugh had an hour to scream that the dems and media should be rounded up and arrested. With Bret Baier sanguinely smiling and not contesting the absurdity of what Rush was saying. None of their viewers watch the ""news"" division at Fox News.;;;No he didn't.  Not with Trump worshippers anyway.  They know that horse has been out of the barn for a long time, and nothing is going to bring it back in.  ""A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.""  This is the GOP in a motherfucking nutshell.  They know that if they get out in front of any fact/truth that is damaging, they can control the narrative by putting a lie out there that the base wants to believe, as soon as feasible, as they know no matter how hard you try to push back on it, the initial lie is what people will believe. Even if the truth is every once in a while stated clearly on Fox News.  Note that you'll never hear Fox and Friends state this truth. ;;;Also right wing chuds still pushing the idea that it was a 4chan hoax despite that being debunked virtually instantly 3 years ago.;;;Every right wing nut will tell u it started with the dossier—its funny how their own state tv network betrays them.;;;Tell that to your 9 o'clock block, your channel is making my family dumber than a bag of hammers with paranoid fake news propaganda:/ ;;;He reminds us of HOW LOW the bar has become.;;;Most people found that out literally months ago.

It all comes from the same train if thought, they are so far into the Foxhole that the reality that they see is that different. This is not a misunderstanding, this is a full belief that the situation is different and it has been preached on Fox.

He does this deliberately, you rile people up or get them to believe something. Wait just a little bit and get rid of it, the people who already took their marching orders are not looking back to check and see if he removed or altered his opinion.

This is textbook what Fox does all the time, say something divisive and emotionally charged - wait until people are charged, retract the article or remove it completely.

The damage is already done, and then if something later on happens to actually come out about the subject that is the opposite of what was said at the start - they don't care because ""they are doing it on the other side"" when in reality, the ""other side"" never said anything, ""news"" just said they did something and then removed it after everyone formed their opinions.

&gt; If you are a news TV channel, you have two options - stick to the standards of news reporting and call yourself news or at the start of every segment you need to inform the public that the show they are watching is not news - the same way that there are content warnings. If you do not do this, you do not get to hide behind any laws of you are just entertainment etc - you will be held to the standards of news.

I'm a 30-year-old tech worker still huge into online gaming and have found myself firmly in the minority when it comes to political or socioeconomic opinions among all my gaming peers.  It's fucking *crazy* to observe and I'm so enthralled with it I honestly feel it's worthy of a book.

To begin to understand these people, you need to revisit the Internet about 15 years ago.  Being an ""edgelord"" was still a thing back then, but it was for laughs.  Wild shit would still occur, as I'm sure every semi-professional Counter-Strike 1.6 player remembers the kid who found and stabbed a guy IRL who taunted him in-game, but such stories were not the norm.

The aspect of Internet culture that seems to have had the biggest impact on people's lives is the enormous disconnect these people feel with their parents and other older relatives.  The Internet was my cool little hangout, my private club with an immense amount of places that no adults ever visited or even knew about.  All of the hilarious videos, the Arnold soundboards, insane vids from Ogrish or FacesOfDeath, text-based sites like Maddox or NegativePositive with stories so funny you'd be laughing for hours, *everything.*  It was our treehouse.

This disconnect between generations has expanded well beyond the Internet and into real-life.  Many of us saw our parents get fucked by the '08 crash.  Many of us went on to school anyway and emerged with crippling amounts of debt.  Many of us were smothered by all of the aforementioned and remained in our hometowns, piecing together our lives with shitty retail jobs.  Many of us have a deeply personal connection to someone we know getting absolutely fucked by the status quo back then.

Today, those people are all my age.  We've either been working the whole time or graduated and tried to make the best of our situations.  Some of us joined the military and lost friends in Afghanistan or Iraq.  People like me, the lucky ones, found stable employment with a high standard of living, but I learned very quickly that I was the exception and not the norm.

We've been guided by adults firmly entrenched in the status quo for our entire lives and that has not worked out for a huge portion of our generation.  Those feelings we had about our parents not having a fucking **clue** about our world have not gone away, rather they have intensified.

And then, along came Trump.  He shits on everything, and I mean everything that has come before him.  It's a huge fucking game to him and those who cheer him on love that he's finally messing with systems that let them down.

It's revenge.  Sure, it's mixed with racism, xenophobia and a huge dose of willful ignorance, but my feeling is that Trump is a vessel of revenge.  Arguments like ""you don't read about the horrific lives of peasants during revolutions in textbooks"" mean absolutely nothing to them.  They don't give a fuck because they are too entertained by the spotlight shining on him day in and day out.

So how does this fit in with Internet culture?  It's simple: there's a lot of demographic crossover.  I was drawn to the Internet because I was a nerd.  Granted, I think I was a cut above the mouth-breathing incels, but I was still a nerd that felt out of place in society.  I still feel that way sometimes today, but I'm an adult now and my life is honestly pretty great, all things considered.  I don't have an inherent desire for revenge the way these people do.

They don't like being told what to do, don't have the capacity for nuance and want to fuck people harder than their families or they themselves have been fucked.

My two cents.;;;Every effort needs to be made into educating their children. The parents at this point are lost.

They're either super rich, low IQ, or racists/bigots. ;;;They're all walking, breathing YouTube comments.

Now you can. ;;;I heard a few, wearing full MAGA gear, interviewed while waiting for Trump to show up. These are remarkably simple, uneducated and functionally illiterate people. I was tempted to call them sad but decided to go with pathetic.;;;I agree, and I know many of them... family members, friends, and neighbors.  I have never heard anyone say anything that is fundamentally positive about him.  All of his supporters can tell you what they hate about other people (gays, minorities, the poor, etc).  All of them can tell you how they feel persecuted or misunderstood.  They defend Trump saying that he is persecuted and misunderstood.  The support for Trump seems to be entirely about him as a symbol, not him as person/leader.;;;Trump is a cult leader at this point. Trying to understand the people who cheer for him is like trying to understand the people who drank the suicide kool-aide because Jim Jones told them to. ;;;Not understanding them, means you are a normal person. They are nuts. People brought up by stupid, surrounded by stupid, and stupid themselves, so they wonder why the world looks down on them. Trump loves them though, they look like fluffy biscuits stuffed with campaign donations to him.;;;Unpatriotic fearful craven bigots, all of them. ;;;Yikes. This is why people need to be educated. ;;;They have hate in their hearts and he encourages that. ;;;They're dumb and poor, and latch on with fervor to any message that tells them they are better than someone else;;;I could be way off, but the same folks thing credit cards are ""free money"" then complain about ""the banks"" when they crazily ask to be paid back.

Literally anyone can ""juice"" an economy, particularly the largest in the world, temporarily by handing money out.  The trick is knowing when to blink.;;;It’s because their lives suck and they want everyone else to suffer too.;;;they're fascists or fascist supporters.

the mueller investigation didn't work because fascism is not a problem you can call the cops on.

it's a political problem with political solutions, which are primarily weakening the billionaires who support it and making the material conditions for everyone else better to build politics of the working class--this is the only way to combat fascism effectively without war.;;;Trump will continually lie to keep his presidency.
Vote him out and he’ll quickly be indicted on many counts of fraud. Americans shouldn’t endorse such corruption in a president and especially should not cheer on and endorse his disregard of sick peoples’ needs for healthcare by further dismantling healthcare. ;;;I think this sub nailed it. People that believe in this jackass are on a short list. Idiots, zealots, racists, and ideologues. That, and the ultra wealthy. ;;;Evangelicals love this rotten son of a bitch.

[ People Who Cheer for This Maniac ]( https://youtu.be/K1bobWPI-ew?t=25  );;;The only people who still cheer for him are racist, assholes, just like the  Cheetos Führer.;;;Trump is the political equivalent of professional “wrasslin”
;;;I think you have to understand a subset of society who failed to raise their kids properly.  Imagine a generation of people who flipped the game board, so to speak, all through their childhood and nobody told them otherwise.  There are people who are essentially raised by the Ricky Bobby method.  They are extreme, almost caricature like versions of humans.  Social media is only making this worse.;;;You know that rush you get when you’re failing at everything and suddenly you succeed?  That’s what being a Trump supporter is like...but instead of really succeeding you’re just tricked into believing you are.;;;I have been a member of AA for 15 + years and have had a very difficult time, since the rise of Trump, understanding (and even accepting) how so many people in the program that I have known for many years (some of them I considered close friends) could support this obvious madman and conman, especially when the whole basis of AA is to “ practice these principles in all our affairs “.  And what are these principles that this 12 step program are based upon?  Honesty, humility, brotherly love, integrity- principles like these.  I was stunned to see how many so-called “awakened” and “recovered” alcoholics I knew for all this time could abandon the principles they had based their lives on so easily for a charlatan who played with nostalgic visions of a reality that does not exist (and probably never did).  When I would try to reason with them, much to my chagrin, they would call me a leftist or democrat and act as if I was the one who needed to wake up.  

The fact is I have never been politically that active, having felt that politicians on all sides generally are only interested in power through their own propaganda.  But Trump is an entirely different situation. He wishes to impose authoritarian views upon the nation that are the antithesis of our nation’s principles, as well as the principles of any spirituality minded person. And he is very clear about this in the way he uses the politics of resentment, fear of the other, greed, dishonesty, and divisiveness to accomplish his goals.  Quite frankly, anyone taken in by this form of propaganda is not a healthy steward of their own mind and heart, and as I previously stated, the task of tasks over the last two years has been accepting that many people I hold dear to my heart have completely been taken in by his methods. 

Unfortunately, there is precedent of this kind of thing occurring previously, where spiritually centered groups became politically divisive, inimical organizations (the oxford group and washingtonians come to mind), so AA built into the traditions of the group an important disclaimer that AA, as an organization, does not support or oppose any clauses. This is prudent and wise, as they true intention of AA (helping other alcoholics recover) would be sabotaged if the group as a whole had any other agendas.  

However, as far as the individual members are concerned (and at the risk of being immodest and self-righteous), I have used their support of Trump as a sort of measuring stick of whether they are authentically motivated to become more evolved human beings or whether they are simply dry drunks who are there for social or ambitious reasons, like a Sunday church goer who feels their weekly attendance at mass absolves them of any other personal responsibility.  
;;;Just remember, 70%+ of Germany was ""Christian"" when Hitler came to power...;;;All trump supporters are selfish immoral people. If you can ignore trump's obvious shortcomings because he did something to benefit you than you just aren't a good person.



;;;Look up the Authoritarian Follower mindset. It explains it all.  They just want a strong leader who will fix everything for them, and Trump is the ultimate con man. ;;;They are willfully ignorant, stupid, hateful, nasty, selfish, greedy and spiteful.

Just like Trump. This is why they love him so much - he is them. Only with wealth and power. They think it will rub off on them.;;;""Asshole politics"" has become an explosive force because of the internet.;;;Pretty simple to understand really. Willfully ignorant people. ;;;Then try reading a few history books, it's called Fascism.

We will never win if we can't even accurately describe the threat.;;;He just sounds so effeminate... breathy and whiny with weak wispy motions.  I don't see how that marshmallow with sprinkles can elicit white supremacy rage out of anyone.;;;Birds of a feather cheer together.;;;This is the most depressing and disconcerting part of Trump’s rise. He showed us all that there are some seriously dumb people out there. And their numbers are big. Before Trump we knew they existed, but now we see them better. In this sense, Trump’s success could have an upside. He has laid bare the magnitude of the challenge before us.;;;It’s a great mystery of the world. The only good that can come out of him is making sure I’m not like those people. I’ve been trying to be hypercritical of my own political views. Challenging my own assumptions and the basis for my values. None of us our perfect. Also the human element of chaos for chaos’s sake- that is- taking sick joy in watching order burn for the sake of order burning will always be a deep part of our human psyche. Sometime’s the worst bubbles to the surface like this it’s age old.;;;They’re lost little followers that can’t discern leadership from a bloviating windbag.

;;;Oh, I ""understand"". That's been the problem, once I understood I didn't have enough respect for fascists to remain in contact with them.;;;Democrats fall in love. Republicans fall in line.  If Jeb Bush won the nomination his crowds would be just as big/deranged.  ;;;It's easy to understand. He's the guy telling people that their shitty lives aren't their fault and that everything would be great if it wasn't for foreigners, immigrants and the democrats.;;;Oh, I understand them pretty well I think. I'm a pretty empathetic person, and I think we *need* to understand them in order to defeat them. This weird assumption that ""understanding"" is synonymous with ""accepting"" drives me batshit.

That empathy makes me see that their values are utterly incompatible with mine, and that they are forcing those incompatible values into my life...the single-word description of this characteristic is ""evil."";;;We are some weird animals, Ladies and Gentlemen ;;;Cult of personality.;;;The thing is - and I have always struggled with this - is why Donald Trump of all people?  Why is he a successful demagogue?

Trump is not an effective orator, he has zero charisma.  He literally sounds like a drunk guy at the bar spewing off about politics.  But thousands of people wait in line, starting at 3 am, to hang on his every word? 

I can see how people found Hitler charismatic, even enthralling.  Listening to one of Hitler’s speeches, even in a language you don’t understand, it is clear how effective he was.  The same is true of L. Ron Hubbard, David Miscaviage, and various other cult leaders.  Trump has none of the talent, but he somehow has the following.

Who the hell are these people who think Trump is a genius?  Are they they the same people who click on ads on websites or fall for Nigerian scammers?;;;1. Not very educated

2. Prone to hate and xenophobia

This a bad combination that makes them extremely easy targets for brainwashing.

I think I've come to terms with the fact that some people are just rotten. I don't think all Trump supporters are, but a good percentage must be.;;;It's a pattern of human behavior that transcends Trump, transcends the GOP, transcends the current populist swell around the world.  Focusing on Trump and Fox as the mastermind behind it all is to miss the bigger picture.  They are symptoms, not the problem.  


People want to feel important.  They want to feel special.  They want to feel part of a community.  A tribe.  We are wired at a very fundamental level to need these things to survive.  Within those groups, we want status and a sense of accomplishment.  A way to succeed.  Most of us don't need to be The Best within that group, but we do need to know we have a chance, a role to play, and a path if we want it.  


If you're the type of person that doesn't have very much going for you personally, or romantically, or professionally (whatever's most important to you) then humans tend to redefine their identity vs. the world to carve out a new tribal identity that they can belong to to get those things.  They change their world view to provide that need.  The lowest form of this is falling back to defining the world as what you *are,* rather than what you *do*.  Define the world as your race/sex/culture/whatever -- something you were born with -- as an inherently unique and special tribe that's in urgent, direct competition with other tribe, and that you are now the champion of.  Then declare war on everyone else.  Congrats, you're now a self-defined hero.  


The more anxious and afraid people are of failing at life in general, the more tribal and polarized and radicalized they get.  The more they define themselves by what they're against because they're failing at anything to actually be for.  And now their entire sense of self-worth and accomplishment and justice is wrapped in how much damage they think they're doing to the other side, by any means necessary, because life has become zero-sum to them.  That's why these people cheer.;;;Some folks cannot differentiate between jerry springer and reality or comprehend the long term impact donnie the douche will have on them and thier kids and grand kids . When you neglect education for 50 years you arrive here today with silly tits hanging on the words of a used car salesman while he robs them blind and steals thier future.;;;What you aren’t grasping is that those who cheer the Cheeto are in fact dumber than the Cheeto. The worst part is that an actual 50% of America is dumber than Donald Trump. ;;;Trumps calls people names (he is more than 70 years old) .  
.  
This tells you about people who support him .  
..  
He is using all of the dictatorship methods -  
dividing our country and corroding democracy .  
  ;;;[It’s easy to understand.](https://youtu.be/ZZvT2r828QY);;;Ignorant people want leaders who blame their failures in life on people who don't look like them or believe in the same mythological religious fairy tales.  Demagogues understand this and manipulate the uneducated to the detriment of their pathetic lives and the benefit of the wealthy elite.

The Republican elite laugh at their gullibility.;;;I don't agree with it, but I think I understand at least a little of what's going on.

There is a big population that has been left behind by the ""traditional elites."" They feel that the system is rigged and that nobody is paying attention to their concerns. If you look books or stories about money in politics and the way that elites rig the system to get their own kids into elite schools, then you'll have a sense of what I'm talking about.

Year after year, both Republicans and Democrats (more often democrats) have been paying lip service to these concerns, but nothing ever changes.

I think this is why people went crazy for both Trump as well as Bernie. Both of them spoke out against the system itself and about how radical changes would be required.

To be clear!! I'm not saying that Trump is at all the solution. But if we ignore the problem, the underlying issues that Trump tapped into that got him elected, then we are doomed to keep being surprised by the people who support him.;;;Trump supporters vocabulary and intelligence is right on with the president. 


Usually that would be a compliment.

It would have been the chance for Muller to exonerate him, entirely and completely while simultaneously attesting to his great mind (good genes!), outstanding health (with big hands!) and incredible pleasant smell (not like sulfur!). 

I wonder who instructed them to do that, since Donald has absolutely nothing to hide, especially not his tax returns or grades in school, and definitely nothing shady about his 40 year working relationship with Russian mobsters! ;;;So it seems he had some competent attorneys. So sad he still retained Rudy Guliani ;;;And it worked...;;;Pretty ridiculous Mueller just gave up on an actual interview with Trump or Jr. I'm waiting on the report to pass final judgment on the probe but it seems like Mueller not surprisingly put too much faith in the system and this contemporaries at the DOJ. ;;;HRC did it for 11 hours...  wonder what the POS traitor trump is hiding;;;This is a very Trumpian move. It's same as how he always talks about how smart he is and he has the highest IQ and went to an Ivy League school. But then his lawyers contact every school he ever attended and threaten them if they release his grades or his scores.

&amp;#x200B;

He talks about how he'd love to sit down with Mueller and he has nothing to hide. And then....;;;Ok, so I know we should wait until we actually see the report, but it sure seems like Mueller dropped the ball in a big, big way by not interviewing The Don himself. ;;;For all the heaps of praise laid upon Mueller as the *prosecutor exemplar*, he was cockblocked from deposing the man literally at the center of his investigation. That doesn't reflect well on him or the investigation.;;;Trump is the Anti-Washington. He CANNOT tell a Truth.;;;I really don’t care. Why did Mueller allow it. That’s unacceptable. ;;;I want Mueller under oath and to be asked, ""Why did you not interview Trump directly?"";;;If he’s so innocent then why are they doing everything they can to block it’s releas?;;;Claims to be rich but wont release his tax returns! Claims to be smart but wont release his grades! Claims to be brave but wont release his bone spur x-rays! CLAIMS TO BE INNOCENT BUT DID NOT HAVE THE BALLS TO SIT DOWN WITH MUELLER TO BE FULLY EXONERATED! Biggest p*ssy in American history!;;;&gt; The suspect is surrounded with convicted guilty parties.  

&gt; The suspect repeatedly fires staff who won't meddle with the investigation.  

&gt; The suspect refuses to be interviewed and fights the investigation tooth and nail before eventually submitting written responses.  

&gt; The suspect hires an AG with a history of wrongdoing who writes a summary saying to ignore all of the publicly available evidence because there's nothing to see here.

&gt; The suspect, AG, and party repeatedly assure us the report exonerates the suspect while simultaneously asserting that nobody needs to read it and we should all take their word for it.

&gt; The AG states if he ever does release the full report he will allow the suspect to make his own redactions.

How stupid do they think we are? Why are we not in the streets? 
;;;Trump is a congenital liar.  Not surprising.;;;Of course they did because they knew he can't tell the truth to save his life.;;;trump (and republicans) - using the Nazi playbook:

**“Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it.”**—Adolf Hitler

**Reminder** - Hillary Clinton testified for 11 hours before Congress about Benghazi.;;;Trump can't even confirm his name without lying, they used to have to meet him in pairs (his own lawyers) otherwise he would lie and deny he said it at the next meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

The man's not right.;;;The fact that key members of the campaign were never thoroughly investigated or interviewed tells me this investigation was ended before it was actually finished.

I know that assumption is operating on little solid knowledge, but come on. How acutely limited was this investigation?;;;Meanwhile, Clinton did 11 hours of Benghazi testimony. Guess who has the iron balls between these two;;;Mueller's report isn't worth the paper its printed on if he didn't even do basic interviews with the prime suspects. Imagine if a Democrat were under investigation and hadn't been interviewed?

The right is successfully destroying the institutions of this country.;;;Lol i bet Mueller’s team made those fucking clowns dance.

We’ll see if anyone gets disbarred when the dust settles.;;;Barr is truly not a servant to our DOJ, only to this stain we call Trump;;;So goes to ‘extraordinary lengths’ to release the report, or maybe the tax returns.;;;We knew this.

r/release_it;;;Why hasn’t Mueller or his team commented either: yes the summary is accurate or no it isn’t and here’s why?;;;We deserve answers as to why Mueller didn’t subpoena Trump, Jr, and Kushner. Would’ve been well within his rights. From the outside, it looks like he let Trump and co get away with a simple “no.”;;;Of course they would, knowing Trump, he would just get himself into more trouble.;;;For a guy who has nothing to hide and is so innocent, he sure doesn’t act like it.;;;Totally nothing to see here....\*eyeroll\*;;;I won't be surprised after this shit-show is over that it gets revealed that Mueller knew that the harm to the country would be greater if he forced this to happen. 

The world knowing exactly how incompetent and incapable of truth Trump is is a huge threat, and would cause even more damage then is being done now. ;;;I think there is an obvious issue that perhaps most folks miss.  It boils down to the fact that Trump simply can't tell the truth.   An investigator interviews people to get more information or confirm what they already know.  It is ridiculous to think that Trump would provide any usable information,  hence they could only bring him in knowing fully they he would perjure himself.  And Mueller could have charged him with it,  but the cry of perjury trap would have made more people question the validity of the investigation.

Without knowing more from Mueller,  I can't positively say that not interviewing Trump was an improper choice.;;;All of this is conjecture. We barely know what is in the report and we don't know what other investigations are ongoing.  We need to consider the very real possibility that what Barr told us is incredibly misleading but technically accurate, things like ""no ties with the Russian government"" come to mind.  That means that there could be lots of ties with Russian businesses and other nation's governments.  The whole Rosneft deal with Qatar comes to mind.

Mueller is known far and wide as a thorough, dedicated investigator and lawyer.  When all of the facts come out, then we can all analyze the events.  Until that time, we are all guessing and using info from highly partisan sources.  ;;;all those years of smug thinkpieces about how terrible his lawyers were and yet... it worked. ;;;be nice if there was more of an uproar demanding the mueller report be released?  where are the protests?  planned marches?

&amp;#x200B;

the only way the public ever sees this report is by us demanding it.  scream at mitch mcconnell and rand paul all you want but as long as we are just observing this fight from our couches nothing will happen.;;;I often amuse myself by imagining his various advisers falling all over themselves, Veep-style, to keep him from opening his mouth or tweeting. ;;;I find this comforting. Those lawyers were not stupid, and realized the risk he faces. He cannot claim to have incompetent counsel now, just an incompetent defendant.;;;Yes, they knew he'd lie Mueller since he lies to them. Thats why his lawyers made it policy to never meet with him alone since he would like about the meeting.;;;Yea they would have been terrible lawyers if they didnt. Trump cant help himself but lie he would for sure have been n more trouble. ;;;Post the names of the lawyers.  ;;;why? scared?;;;we had this information, and we laughed about how the President* was too dumb to get himself into a perjury trap-- without even Mueller trying to pull a fast one;;;Of fucking course he did ;;;this has to be the only reason mueller decided not to make a decision on obstruction. the fact that he didn't subpoena trump is just bizarre, and assuming barr didn't secretly shut down his probe, he dropped the ball big time.;;;https://old.reddit.com/r/DrumpfPerjureTime/

I think he trolled us, on a big scale. And no, it wasn’t to save Trump, no, but the fact that more than 50% of GOP is guilty by association would not make a life-long Republican throw them behind bars. I don’t understand why Dems put so much faith in him. He took FOREVER to finish this investigation, and the fact that he didn’t even interview any of Trump’s kids tells me there’s something dodgy there.

By 2022, the GOP wont speak of him (cough Bush2.0 cough), they'll have swapped out a lot of their actors (new shiny candidates that supported the party, but not the imperfect vessel!), and a handful of boomerangs that jumped out the spotlight before the fallout landed (Paul Ryan, I know you're going to run for something by 2024!).

Unless they can steal another election, and  then it'd be back to ""Dear Leader vs The Dirty Dems"".;;;How brave of him to say that now that he's not running again;;;Flake then added ""But i'll absolutely vote for Trump despite having said this."";;;$100 says he’ll pout and feign disgust but vote for Trump anyway;;;""I'm so mad that I keep getting bullied into voting for everything Trump does that I'd rather see a Democrat win so I can return to being an obstructionist asshole"" - Jeff Flake;;;well flake is a RINO, so it makes sense. Love how the result is now both sides hate him. ;;;Him or Kasich could try to primary donald.  They could run as independents on a strict right basis.  Run as a dignified conservative.

But instead they're thinking about another office or a run for president after donald is gone.

Thinking about all the football spiking due to the Barr memo, and how they're saying that dems are so salt...it's really the rational conservatives that needed Mueller to take down donald the most.  

It's people like Flake that had their party highjacked by a no-principles demagogue.  It's Flake's GOP that was exposed as not a ""family values, gracious christian"" party, but one of grievance and racism.

Dems aren't going to restore that veneer of dignity for them.  Mueller isn't going to restore that for them.

I'm reminded of this quote about John Brown by Frederick Douglass

&gt;His zeal in the cause of freedom was infinitely superior to mine. Mine was as the taper light, his was as the burning sun. Mine was bounded by time. His stretched away to the silent shores of eternity. I could speak for the slave. John Brown could fight for the slave. I could live for the slave. John Brown could die for the slave.

I'm not saying Flake has to storm a military base.  I'm not saying he should literally put his life in danger, but he needs to be willing to sacifice his political (and financial) life for a greater good.;;;I doubt that, personally. ;;;Votes with trump over 90% of time;;;Democrats and Republicans agree, Flake can get fucked.

I want them to eat each other alive. ;;;Jeff Flake should fall into an open manhole and just stay there. ;;;""When asked if he would follow through and vote for a Democratic candidate, Flake, brow wrinkled to the eighth setting to denote how worried he was about being put on the spot, fumbled out a reassurance that he would still support the GOP regardless. Flake, clearly disturbed at the notion of actually making a decision, fell to the floor and began folding himself twelve times."";;;Fuck flake. ;;;“If” lol. Not a single republican has enough spine to try and primary him. They’ll him and haw and tease it, maybe, but no one’s gonna pull the trigger on it. They’ll flake in like like they have for past two years now. ;;;The time to say that was 12 moths ago. ;;;Jeff Flake: always saying the right thing, while doing the wrong thing.;;;Says the guy who voted for Brett, he can say whatever he wants, we know he's a liar.;;;Why doesn’t some reporter grill him on why he voted almost all the time for Trumps policies and appointments then;;;Well he is a Democrat, so yeah.;;;But he will still vote for Trump because he's a lying coward. ;;;*2020 election rolls around, Flake votes for Teump*

;;;Flake back in headlines to play his wankers like a fiddle. ;;;Flake, I could care less about your opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;;;;But only because he perceives Trump as hurting the Republican brand, and knows that the centrist neolibs serve the same moneyed interests that Republicans do.

;;;I'm a volunteer EMT and was at one point on the medicine path. At any rate, Schiff reminds me of this physician I use to work with who always kept a cool head and was able to handle pressure very well, especially in unusual or absurd conditions.

I remember once we had a patient with a diaphragmatic rupture (basically your tummy guts are now in the upper chest), evidence of damage to the spinal cord, and me burying the lede with this story, was also brought in cardiac arrest. Basically, it was all gloom and doom.

The young man recovered ultimately. Somehow. But I remember how everyone just didn't know what to think or what to do or how to do it. But this one dude just took charge, analyzed the situation, made sure that basic life support was being given and given well, called in the trauma and neuroteam, etc. 

We were at a point some days ago where many of us just didn't know what to think and the media made it much worse.

Finally, they've caught up now and in no uncertain terms this is due to Adam Schiff. He withstood the nonsense and propaganda and just broke right through it.

I always think of representatives as people who are supposed to represent our interests. Crazy idea, I know.

But Schiff is actually fucking doing it.

As an aside, I honestly think in the future Schiff's opening at the hearing (Yesterday? Can't really tell time anymore) will become a matter of general knowledge. If you haven't seen it do yourself a favor and see it. It's patriotism and sincerity at its finest.;;;That's a real American hero!!! Love it;;;When I hear Schiff speak I feel hope for our republic.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*;;;I don’t know what it is but I cringe at the usage of slang like “smack down” and “clap back” in these titles. It really takes away from the seriousness of this situation and makes it seem like some Real Housewives or Love and Hip Hop drama;;;This was one of the most stirring speeches I've heard in a long while. It perfectly laid out the case against Trump and blew away Republicans' petty attempts to argue technicalities over realities.

The crux of Republicans' continued support for Trump is intentional cognitive dissonance. They take each Trump lie, each criminal or unethical act, devoid of context and ignore the whole picture of a decadent, dishonest man recklessly swerving through event after incriminating event for decades of his life. I'm not surprised. It's the only way one could possibly defend Trump.

We need more people like Schiff calling out Trump in no uncertain terms.;;;Here's why Schiff's words are so important: despite Trump's and Barr's best efforts to convince his base to the contrary, everything Barr said did really happen. We can reliably conclude that they happened because of one or more of the following:

a) Trump and/or his people acknowledged that they happened (the Trump Tower meeting for example)

b) We've seen evidence that the administration hasn't denied (Trump Jr's email response)

c) We've seen it in Mueller's ""speaking"" indictments, meaning the prosecution has evidence to back it up

For those critical of Schiff, think about the line of bullshit you're buying: an AG Trump appointed who has previously run interference for Republicans in hot water has used legal-speak to identify one specific crime Mueller has chosen not to prosecute, while handing multiple investigations off to other jurisdictions. Trump is guilty of the same crime for which Clinton was impeached and for one of the offenses listed in Nixon's articles of impeachment. You can crow about how you think you're winning all you want, but there are some chickens coming home to roost and yelling WITCH HUNT won't make them go away. 

Historically, we're at the equivalent point in the Nixon timeline where everyone knew there were tapes and the administration didn't want them released. Of course observers with even a shred of logic kinda figured that if the tapes/Mueller Report weren't so damning then the administration would have no problem releasing them, so we can pretty much figure that it's gonna be ugly when they see the light of day. 

That's not an enviable position to be in.;;;God damn, Schiff! 

&gt;My colleagues might think it’s okay that the Russians offered dirt on the Democratic candidate for president as part of what’s described as the Russian government’s effort to help the Trump campaign. You might think that’s okay. My colleagues might think it’s okay that when that was offered to the son of the president, who had a pivotal role in the campaign, that the president’s son did not call the FBI, he did not adamantly refuse that foreign help — no, instead that son said he would ‘love’ the help with the Russians.

&gt;You might think it was okay that he took that meeting. You might think it’s okay that Paul Manafort, the campaign chair, someone with great experience running campaigns, also took that meeting. You might think it’s okay that the president’s son-in-law also took that meeting. You might think it’s okay that they concealed it from the public. You might think it’s okay that their only disappointment after that meeting was that the dirt they received on Hillary Clinton wasn’t better. You might think it’s okay. I don’t.

&gt;You might think it’s okay that, when it was discovered a year later that they had lied about that meeting and said it was about adoptions, you might think it’s okay that the president is reported to have helped dictate that lie. You might think it’s okay. I don’t.

&gt;You might think it’s okay that the campaign chairman of a presidential campaign would offer information about that campaign to a Russian oligarch in exchange for money or debt forgiveness. You might think that’s okay. I don’t. You might think it’s okay that that campaign chairman offered polling data, campaign polling data, to someone linked to Russian intelligence. I don’t think that’s okay.

&gt;You might think it’s okay if that the president himself called on Russia to hack his opponent’s emails, if they were listening. You might think it’s okay that, later that day, the Russians in fact attempted to hack a server affiliated with that campaign. I don’t think that’s okay.

&gt;You might think that it’s okay that the president’s son-in-law sought to establish a secret back-channel of communication with Russians through a Russian diplomatic facility. I don’t think that’s okay.

&gt;You might think it’s okay that an associate of the president made direct contact with the GRU through Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks, that is considered a hostile intelligence agency. You might think it’s okay that a senior campaign official was instructed to reach that associate and find out what that hostile intelligence agency had to say, in terms of dirt on his opponent.

&gt;You might think it’s okay that the national security adviser-designate secretly conferred with a Russian ambassador about undermining U.S. sanctions, and you might think it’s okay he lied about it to the FBI.

&gt;You might say that’s all okay. You might say that’s just what you need to do to win. But I don’t think it’s okay. I think it’s immoral, I think it’s unethical, I think it’s unpatriotic and, yes, I think it’s corrupt, and evidence of collusion.

&gt;Now, I have always said that whether this amounts to proof of conspiracy was another matter. Whether the special counsel could prove beyond a reasonable doubt the proof of that crime was up to the special counsel and that I would accept his decision, and I do. He is a good an honorable man and he is a good prosecutor.

&gt;But I do not think that conduct, criminal or not, is okay. And the day we do think that’s okay is the day we will look back and say, that is the day America lost its way.

&gt;And I’ll tell you one more thing that is a propos of the hearing today. I don’t think it’s okay that during a presidential campaign Mr. Trump sought the Kremin’s help to consummate a real estate deal in Moscow that would make him a fortune. According to the special counsel, hundreds of millions of dollars. I don’t think it’s okay that he concealed it from the public.  don't think it's okay he advocated a new and more favorable policy towards the Russians, even as he was seeking the Russian's help, the Kremlin’s help, to make money.

&gt;I don't think it's okay that his attorney lied to our committee. There is a different word for that than collusion and it's called compromise. And that's the subject of our hearing today.

https://dailykos.com/stories/2019/3/28/1845989/-Adam-Schiff-s-hard-hitting-indictment-of-GOP-collusion;;;The following facts are not disputed by either side:

**Immoral** - Cheated on his wife with a porn star when his newborn son was only 3 months old. His personal lawyer Rudy Guiliani doesn't dispute this fact, only that the payment made to Stormy Daniels to keep quiet wasn't campaign-related, so it wasn't a campaign finance law violation.

**Unpatriotic**- Publicly attacked a Gold Star family who was critical of him. Didn't attend Arlington National Cemetery on Veteran's Day even though it was on his schedule. When confronted about Vladimir Putin's various muders he said ""There are a lot of killers. You think our country's so innocent?"". Shared privileged intelligence produced by one our allies with a foreign adversary. Told a military widow during a condolence phone call her husband ""knew what he was getting into"" only moments after getting his name wrong.

**Corrupt**- In a plainly simple violation of the Emoluments clause of the Constitution, he operates a hotel adjacent to the White House where foreign dignitaries can stay when they come to visit him, opening up a convenient financial channel by which he and his family can enrich themselves due to their position in the Federal government. There are enough examples of Donald Trump's corruption to fill a book, but some of those issues are still being investigated and litigated, so both sides won't agree on every single case. But Emoluments are clearly a huge problem unless you're being intentionally obtuse.

EDIT: 3 months old, not 3 years old;;;This is the kind of person that I want representing me.  This is the kind of person I expect of every member in congress.;;;So ballsy...

You know what would be a real smackdown

Schiff issuing subpoenas for the complete unredacted report and jailing anyone who doesn’t comply...LIKE HE HAS THE POWER TO DO!;;;We said we wanted to run our country like a business.  We forgot that corporate CEO are sociopathic totalitarian despots that run command economies. ;;;Schiff makes an important note that Trump may not have violated the law by refusing to denounce Russian interference but still acted extremely immoral and unpatriotic.;;;I would make a campaign ad out of that speech and just play it on repeat in Nunes’s district next year.;;;See, the problem is, everyone already knows that.  What you have to do is is figure out how to beat an immoral, unpatriotic and corrupt guy in an election. ;;;Lindsey Graham used this following statement, “While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.” 

To try to impeach Clinton...;;;It was a thing of beauty to watch.  ;;;Unpatriotic? I've seen the man hug the Flag. Twice!  He may have even groped it a bit.;;;Seriously, if Obama called Eric Kanter a ""pencil neck"" or Joyn BONNER, (""like Little Adam Shit"")'.  Not one Republican or Dem would be against impeachment...Schiff rant was awesome, better than what Schumer and Pelosi are dishing out!;;;Stop, you had me at immoral.;;;From my other comment:

&amp;#x200B;

All the issues Schiff laid out need to be repeated again. And again. And again.

They completely 100% justify why there was a probe in the first place.

They 100% call in to question a number of things, including the fuckton of LIES, that came from Trump and his campaign during the entire thing.

They 100% reveal again and again how corrupt and immoral this POTUS and his friends/family are and why he should be removed from office for being so goddamn unfit.

The number of questions that arise from all this are staggering. I hope the thorough, unredacted, report has answers to all of mine:

1. The AG's opinion that Trump didn't obstruct justice. Why? Because there wasn't a conspiracy? Is that all? Or does he think the president CAN'T obstruct justice. Very different things. Before he was hired by Trump he wrote an memo to the justice department saying the president CAN'T obstruct justice. Major conflict there.
2. Either way, NOTHING Trump has done constitutes obstruction of justice? Not asking Comey to ""let flynn go""? Not threatening Comey to shut up publicly, insinuating Trump has tapes? Or threatening other witnesses and 'rats'? It's possible that Trump wasn't obstructing justice because he wanted to cover up the ""collusion"". Especially if there wasn't any in the end. But he could be just trying to keep the feds off him, his family and his business. Was this considered at all?
3. Or how about a big one? HE TRIED TO FIRE THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. As well as pressured senators to close their investigation as well.Was reporting on this accurate? How is this not attempted obstruction?
4. Did the White House or the president have any involvement in Barr's decision on obstruction, or his summary, or any part of the process?
5. Towards the end even I started realizing that Trump people are just too stupid to have been involved in some huge conspiracy in these SPECIFIC crimes. BUT isn't there a lot of events and people that we know of publicly that we definitely need more information on? And how these things were resolved? Such as...
6. The Trump tower meeting. And other contacts of Trump related people with Russians. If there is nothing there, we need to see what WAS found and if these things were thoroughly looked at (I'm sure they were as I trust Mueller in general). I think there's probably a bigger concern as to what wasn't look at at all.  So... nothing came of the meeting with the Russians? No one in that meeting is in trouble for doing that? It's ok for presidential campaigns to meet with foreign nationals about ""help"" in the election? Are we forgetting that the original story Trump camp told about that meeting was that it didn't happen at all? Then it did happen, but it was about adoptions. Then it wasn't about adoptions... it was indeed about help in the election.
7. Which relates to the next big one... If there was nothing shady going on, WHY IN THE FUCK ARE PEOPLE GOING TO PRISON FOR LYING ABOUT EVERYTHING? Why lie? Why lie about Russian contacts. Why lie about Trump/Russia business like Trump tower Moscow? Why lie about the above mentioned meeting(s)?
8. Is it reasonable to assume that a lot of things were found, but didn't fall under the direct scope of Mueller's mandate? If so what are those things? Were they handed off to other departments/jurisdictions or ignored entirely? We need more answers to fully understand.
9. Why didn't Mueller interview Trump directly? Written answers are good enough? What were the answers to the questions he was asked anyway? We need to see those. If Trump hasn't been honest about a lot of things regarding god knows how many issues, to the point of PERJURING HIMSELF on paper, it's extremely important. Again, why lie?  For reference: Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath (as he should have been because presidents should be held to higher, not lower, standards of the law)... about a blowjob.
10. Now on just straight up pro-Russia stuff (I'm not even sure Mueller looked into this...). Why has Trump almost ALWAYS disagreed with the special counsel, FBI, and CIA's assessment of the Russian interference in the election? He publicly disagreed with our intel agencies that Russian messed with the election, saying Putin said he didn't do it ""very strongly and very powerfully"". Why was Trump campaigns only change to the Republican platform a pro-Russia stance on Ukrainian defense aid? Were these things looked into?  Is this part of a different investigation or did Mueller not really care about this kind of stuff?  Which leads me to next question:
11. Is Trump being compromised or under the influence of the Russian government something that was investigated? Being compromised is not the same as being in a conspiracy to commit a pretty specific crime. Like deals or 'quid pro quo' as it's referred to.   
 A ""relationship"" and back scratching is not necessarily an official agreement. For example, you can have a side piece for 5 years and she's not technically your real girlfriend, let alone wife.  But there's definitely a relationship there so don't be surprised if she starts getting pushy about being official.  I'm not even sure being compromised is a crime. But isn't it important to know?
12. On the point above... Trump was on the campaign trail, then over and over and OVER during his presidency saying there were NO contacts. There were NO meetings. There were NO business deals between anyone he knew and the Russians. This was NOT TRUE.  Whether you're a Republican or Democrat, whether you like Trump or hate him, these were lies.  He and everyone on his campaign were LYING TO YOU.  So doesn't this mean that he opened himself up to Russian's having kompromat on him? They KNEW he and his associates/family were lying about these things. To the public and possibly to federal investigators. Isn't this a BONKERS security issue?  We need to understand whether it was resolved or not.  What in the fuck. 
13. Lastly, I hope Mueller has very thorough, detailed evidence as to why. Why why why did the Russians want Trump to win.  Like, in detail. What was their justification for their vast efforts and money? What did they think they could/WOULD get out of it? What conversations did they have about electing him? I think it would be very enlightening to a lot of people.  
14. More questions to come I'm sure... A lot of this is very mind-boggling.;;;Obama caught major flak from GOP for wearing a tan suit (Reagan did too) or 

Obama saluting military personnel improperly (with a cup of coffee) (Trump insulted a Gold star family and John McCain) or 

Obama saying in a debate that he'd consider meeting with North Korea (Trump not only met with Kim Jung Un, he said he liked him and called him a friend) and takes him at his word just like he does Putin.

So Adam Schiff is correct. Particularly about Trump being unpatriotic. He should've taken it a step further and called out the hypocrisy of the GOP. ;;;It's not really a smackdown as much as cold hard facts. ;;;First off...love it!  I find it super interesting that Schiff seemed to be referencing if not actually reading from notes. Ya think he saw this coming from that far off? He has the pleasure of cutting off their response to his response because they used/abused their time, and it was time to address the actual business of the day. I really hope, and really believe this should go down in history right along side of "" have you no sense of decency, sir?"" ;;;I already knew the words Schiff was going to say even before I heard them.  He was succint.  It was presented in a way anyone could understand. Well done.

What gets me again and again though is Representative Nunes just being disrespectful and turning and not listening and not being able to take criticism.  Don't get me wrong, it's not surprising.  But just seeing his spinelessness in action as he's getting called out for his spinelessness.;;;Schiff is the last of the dying breed. A true Patroit. ;;;""delivers massive smackdown"" is exactly how the president in Idiocracy would talk about these matters. We're getting there.

Note: This is not an attack on Schiff or his points, but rather shitty headlines that seem like they're written so middle-schoolers can understand them.;;;While I dislike clickbait exaggerations - ""Schiff DESTROYS Trump!"" - I'm glad to see someone with some authority standing up to Trump. The best the left had for a while was Franken, and he had to go.

It took McCain too long to find his inner Maverick again, having spent the first year and a half of Trump's presidency doing the Winnie the Pooh ""oh, bother"" sigh at every new scandal. Graham got his hypnotoad surgically implanted, and the few guys like Ryan and Flake had a conscience, but no spine.

Now there are some Democrats in power, and it's nice that they can speak out against Trump **and** *do* something - even if it's exposing him and the GOP for every ounce of evil they are. 

So rant on, Schiff. Roll up your sleeves and get this done. But, so help me Beyonce, you better not turn out to have the *tiniest* runt-of-the-mouse-litter skeleton in your closet. I don't want to hear that you didn't tip 15% that one time, or forgot to cancel an appointment, or kept a library book past its due date.;;;Adam Schiff has been on the side of good for a long long time.  He has been personally involved in prosecuting Russian spies.

Shaming those assholes in such an eloquent way was just ... great.

Then Trump gets his idiots laughing by saying “yea but he’s a pencil neck!”.

Idiots don't realize that almost half the vegetables and fruit in the grocery store right now come through Mexico. I point this out, and they tell me ""we can grow our own!"" - Yeah, good luck growing an Avocado or Tomato in the upper Midwest in February. 

&amp;#x200B;;;;It's just a distraction attempt to get the media off the Barr/Mueller/Schiff story.;;;&gt;Given that it is impossible for Mexico to “immediately” end  undocumented immigration to the U.S., one could read this threat as more  like a *promise* to close at least “sections of” the border next  week, which would seem to be something that would trigger an immediate  economic crisis in both countries, given the immediate manufacturing and  consumer shortages it would create. Washington Post reporter Josh  Dawsey, for what it’s worth, [thinks](https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/1111669436640051200) that Trump is referring not to a full closure but to a plan that’s been under consideration for [several months](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pentagon-plans-to-dispatch-800-more-troops-to-us-mexico-border-in-response-to-migrant-caravan/2018/10/25/6a121944-d868-11e8-83a2-d1c3da28d6b6_story.html?utm_term=.fba9c04cb681)  which would bar the entry of Central American asylum-seekers on  national security grounds. But the White House does not seem to have  issued any clarification about whether this is in fact, what the  president means by “closing,” and it doesn’t appear that anyone else in  the Trump administration, including Homeland Security chief Kirstjen  Nielsen, had any involvement in Trump’s [sudden escalation](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/28/trump-mexico-border-migrant-surge-1241307) of the issue.           
&gt;  
&gt;In any case, Media Matters’ invaluable Fox News/Fox Business  tracker Matthew Gertz has likely figured out why this is all happening:  Because Trump saw several people demand border closures on last night’s  Fox programming.

Maybe we should let him implement some of his dumbest policy ideas and edicts and allow the population to feel the results...sure we would all suffer and it would be horrific, but maybe it would shock the fools into voting against this buffoon in 2020. If we keep stopping him and trying to explain things to the general population, they never have to actually feel any consequences so they don't face the mistake they made. It will hurt in the short term, but maybe in the long run it is the only answer to this conundrum. I don't think we know how to deal with cults effectively. And when things get out of hand, many people get desperate enough to try tough love.

But it's not legal to have Russian money in your campaign finances.;;;Money laundering is legal now?;;;&gt;Collusion or not, President Trump and the Russians are thick as thieves.  
&gt;  
&gt;What  I mean is that for more than three decades, at least 13 people with  known or alleged links to the Russian Mafia held the deeds to, lived in  or ran criminal operations out of Trump Tower in New York or other Trump  properties. I mean that many of them used Trump-branded real estate to  launder vast amounts of money by buying multimillion-dollar condos  through anonymous shell companies. I mean that the [Bayrock Group](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/we-will-be-in-moscow-the-story-of-trumps-30-year-quest-to-expand-his-brand-to-russia/2018/11/29/91f9f100-f3f4-11e8-aeea-b85fd44449f5_story.html?utm_term=.59b05088beea),  a real estate development company that was based in Trump Tower and had  ties to the Kremlin, came up with a new business model to franchise  Trump condos after he lost billions of dollars in his Atlantic City  casino developments, and helped make him rich again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yet  Trump’s relationship with the Russian underworld, a de facto state  actor, has barely surfaced in the uproar surrounding Russia’s  interference in the 2016 campaign. That oversight may be explained in  part by journalist Michael Kinsley’s long-held maxim: The real scandal  isn’t what’s illegal; it’s what *is* legal.

* Donald Trump has knowingly and intentionally defrauded Trump University students, fleecing them out of thousands of dollars
* He may have illegally coordinated with his SuperPac
* He illegally used corporate resources to pay an employee to write a political speech
* He violated federal law by claiming proceeds from various Trump products would go to charity, although there is no evidence that Trump ever donated the money to charity
* He violated IRS rules by using $12,000 from his charity organization to purchase a Tim Tebow helmet
* He violated election laws by emailing foreign officials to solicit political contributions
* He violated federal laws by offering Ben Carson a job in exchange for his endorsement
* His employees violated a U.S. trade embargo by pursuing commercial activities in Cuba when it was illegal to do so
* He’s run afoul of election laws by using campaign contributions to pay $6 million to his own businesses
* He violated Wisconsin election laws by talking with voters as they stood in line to vote
* He violated New York state education laws for operating a for-profit investment school without the required license
* His foreign policy proposals would violate NATO
* He’s violated copyright law for using copyrighted images without permission
* Many of the proposals he has vowed to pursue as President violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments of the Constitution
* Trump broke New York state law by lobbying to prevent an Indian casino from opening in the Catskills
* His vow to use torture on suspected terrorists would violate the Geneva conventions. He would be committing war crimes.
* He broke anti-discrimination laws to keep a mob boss gambling at one of his casinos

I would recommend the ""This American Life"" [podcast](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/670/beware-the-jabberwock/act-two-3) that does a good job of describing what a foul pig this guy is ;;;So I was listening to the This American Life podcast today, where they looked at Alex Jones and the Sandy Hook conspiracy.

Claims by Alex Jones, from his own mouth:

Obama and Hillary are/were possessed. People can smell the sulphur on them.

He got in a fight at school, in the lunch room, where he took on the entire Football team. 20 guys. Took them all down. He was like Hercules.

Sandy Hook was a false flag. Sandy Hook involved actors. Sandy Hook parents were liars. Jones has also given personal information, including the addresses of several victims parents, to his fans on public radio, while claiming no responsibility for the harassment and death threats they have faced.

He saw police officers selling hardcore drugs at parties. Later when they came to his school for a D.A.R.E assembly, he heroically stood and proclaimed them drug dealers themselves, whereupon they took him to a back room and beat him. Jones claims this is the pivotal moment that turned him against the Deep State, and has claimed it multiple times. None of the rest of his school remembers this.

He is a big cuddly teddy bear.

Claims from others about Jones:

He used to pretend to be the antichrist at school.

He claimed to be Satan at school.

He jumped a guy and fractured his head in 11 places. Alex claims this guy pulled him from class to fight him. Jones' father visited the boy in the hospital and paid his medical bills. Jones does not deny this part, but also does not explain why his father would pay for the medical bills (to the tune of 10s of thousands of dollars) for a bully who attacked Jones without provocation.

He described in great detail to a girl in his class how he would rape her.

He would make his mouth and teeth black, the coach thinks he would bite into a pen to make this happen.

The guy he beat at school (using a piledriver), his friends jumped Jones at a party, beating him bad enough his parents took him to Austin.

This was all from a single, 60 minute episode. ;;;You'd have to be a complete POS scumbag to listen to this turd.    ;;;Knowledge Fight is a GREAT podcast that picks his show apart ;;;[Knowledge Fight](https://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/) really helps to explain how at least Alex Jones helped lead us where we are today.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*;;;&gt;\[If\]  the lawsuits then pending against the gun industry at the time had  actually asserted that the use of a gun by a criminal is itself a  sufficient basis to impose liability on the gun manufacturer, no  generally accepted legal principle would have supported liability. But,  in that event, there would be no reason for Congress to intervene with  legislation because the lawsuits would be destined to fail long before  they could reach trial. **If, however, the legislation was designed to  block suits, even though they were based on generally accepted legal  principles, then PLCAA amounts to an effort by Congress to exempt the  gun industry from the legal rules that apply to all other industries as  well as to make it more difficult for gun violence victims to pursue  their legal remedies than it would be for other victims of dangerous  products. In that event, PLCAA would be nothing but a particularly  egregious example of special interest legislation. This is what it was.**           
&gt;  
&gt;Congress, doing the NRA’s bidding, enacted PLCAA precisely  because it feared that under generally accepted legal principles, the  threat of industry liability was real. This is not to say that, absent  PLCAA, the municipal lawsuits, or similar suits by gun violence victims,  would all have succeeded. The application of general liability  principles is generally a matter of state law, and courts often reach  differing results in different cases. But **prior to PLCAA, appeals courts  in Ohio, New Jersey, and Indiana, applying general principles of state  liability law, had found that gun companies may be held responsible for  distributing their products through irresponsible dealers while showing  willful blindness toward the dealers’ bad conduct.**         

;;;republicans don't care about dead children ;;;Of course they did!

The bill protecting Bushmaster from being sued no longer being a barrier to this suit means that after these families lose this lawsuit, then they're probably going to get sued by Bushmaster and lose that lawsuit next.

Ultimately the only people who are going to win in this are the lawyers who convinced these families to fuck themselves by losing a few high-profile lawsuits, and the gun lobby that will grow even stronger as a result of it.;;;A bill that Bernie Sanders voted for.

This doesn't matter. Just vote. ;;;&gt; Biden and Sanders both lead Trump by 10-point margins at this point, 55 percent to 45 percent.

&gt;That’s not a great place to be for the President in one of the three states that put him over the top in the Electoral College four years ago. Trump won Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan by a combined 80,000 vote margin, and strategists in both parties say those states are the ones that will most likely determine the 2020 presidency.


Trump's going to need help.   We're going to see a bombardment of internet propaganda like we've never seen.  And we thought it was bad before.

;;;The PA Democratic governor Tom Wolf won by 17 points in 2018. If that many people support the Dem candidate in 2020, there's no way Trump can win PA. ;;;Trump has 63 million votes.

However, whoever is at the top of ticket come next year, we gotta come together and support.;;;Build the Blue Wall;;;Someone I know (who is not a Trump supporter) is convinced that Trump will win reelection. I disagree. Trump lied, cheated and stole his way to a statistical blip of a win centered on four states and has done **absolutely nothing** to expand that base since. As a matter of fact, his actions and behavior have turned off a growing number of independent voters as he hardens his stance to cater to his inner-core White Nationalist base. More and more people are ""wising up"" to the con man that Trump is. At this point, and this is my unscientific opinion only, it is mathematically impossible for Trump to win reelection.;;;Plenty of time tho for people to get complacent and let him get re-elected . ;;;Was Trump leading in PA polls at this time prior to the last election?;;;Fuck the polls. Get out and vote. Don’t even read this shit just vote!!!;;;Over-confidence and complacency is the danger.

Get up off your ass and VOTE!!!;;;This doesn't really mean anything. The election isn't for another year and a half

In 2016 polls had John Kasich leading in a bunch of states also;;;So can we finally dispense with the notion that only a centrist can win the rust belt states? They want jobs and healthcare - it's that simple.;;;After 2016 , I don't pay attention to any poll. Just focus on voting and getting at least one more person to vote.;;;Here's what annoys me. Republicans have won one popular vote since 1992, their party just lost 40 seats in the House, and the Democrats outvoted Republicans the last two elections by 12 million votes.

Yet all I hear is Trump is a sure thing by so many. No incumbent has ever been so unpopular and so vulnerable. And he's not done one thing to ever appease the majority of Americans.

If we vote like we did in the midterms Trump is done.;;;Hillary also lead in the polls.... 
Dont start this overconfidence crap, Democrats.  People need to actually go vote this time;;;He doesn’t even have to campaign for 2020. Russia will just elect him President again lol. ;;;The fact he has any meaningful support still is fucking mortifying as an American.;;;""Trump's gonna lose again""

&amp;#x200B;

\--polls;;;Lots of buyer's remorse in this state considering the very people that put him there are now paying for the tax refunds of 1% of the other residents.  🙄🙄🙄;;;Please, oh please, do not trust any polls.

Its ok to release polls. No one is claiming that the polls forsee the future. What exactly are you arguing? That all polling cease? Calm down.;;;&gt;Biden and Sanders both lead Trump by 10-point margins at this point, 55 percent to 45 percent.

&gt;Trump fares significantly better against the other Democrats the poll tested — all those matchups are within the poll’s margin of error — but he doesn’t lead in a single one. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) leads him by four points, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) leads him by three and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) leads him by two in the survey.


It looks like Bernie is by far the best candidate to defeat Trump.  The others are just barely beating him.  Biden isn't even running.;;;Oh he has no chance in PA. None. Trust me.;;;This is good news indeed. Keep opening your mouth drumph please keep saying and doing what you do, i love watching him dig that grave. metaphorically of course, he wouldnt know how to actually use any tools, manly because he is a tool, a fat bigoted loud mouthed tool that many use to hide thier insecurity and racism backed fear of the world changing around them.;;;I see a lot of commenters saying that Trump is going down easily.

No way. The winner in 2020 will squeak by. 

A Biden might do well with the fickle Trump/Obama switch voters, but less so with minorities, thus putting Florida at risk put keeping safe the rust belt.

Conversely, a super progressive Harris for example, might keep PA and MI in Trump's orbit.

Lastly, it is far too soon.

This Mueller report that was supposed to have killed Trump will now be his hammer in 2020. There is a 0% chance of impeachment.

Trumps opponent, whoever he or she may be, must be tough enough to withstand his bullying and focused enough on the issues without sounding like a Hillary-esque robot. Also, no area can be taken for granted. The Blue Wall must be reinforced, the Midwest courted.

It is eminently doable, but failure is certain if people become complement and ignore certain groups of voters.;;;Fucking good.

He spent $13.5million on 4 trips to Mar a Lago.

GOP budgeting isn’t about spreading scarce resources to do the most good for the taxpayers. Their budgets always aim to cut taxes paid by corporations and their wealthy owners/investors, while making the taxes paid by the poor and middle class cover infrastructure and basic services. 

What they can’t cut from services, they cover with the largest debt ceiling and deficit in history.

After his big supposed ""vindication"" from Barr's interpretation of Mueller's work, the first thing he does is go after ACA, an issue that cost the GOP so dearly in the midterms.  

He has the political acumen of a brick to reach out beyond the MAGA crowd. A swing voter *might* be willing to listen to him after perhaps willing to put the Russia cloud past him, but he goes and fucks it up within days of Barr's ""exoneration"".;;;Republican politicians exist to create and support vehicles of wealth transfer to the wealthy. And it's becoming apparent that in recent years they've also taken up the mantle of supporting a soft coup with the aid of Putin and his network of oligarchs. 

They can't craft popular policy, because most of the population stands to lose under their leadership. Instead, they seize power through voter suppression, propaganda, and lately - blatant acts of obstruction of justice. 

They hold sham hearings on matters of concern to the people in an effort to pacify a public that is subject to and in full support of the rule of law. They use their power for one goal only: to seize more power.

In the midst of this awfulness with Trump and the GOP being fully psychotic, people are losing sight of just how far the window has moved on accepting their bullshit.  


Only 15 years ago the Dixie Chicks were essentially destroyed for lightly criticizing Bush on the Iraq War.  If Republicans mentioned 'socialism', it shut down all debate on the topic.  Universal Healthcare was considered  a harbinger of Soviet style breadlines.  


None of that would happen today.  We have members of congress openly embracing social democracy.  Here we have the Jacobin on the front page of a  pretty mainstream site and people are hardly batting an eye.  An entire generation is coming of age that was so thoroughly curb-stomped by Boomer greed that the idea of the American Dream is just an amusing anachronism.  


Massive change is on its way to America, and the next few years are really all about the race for the GOP (the instrument of the oligarchy) and its dwindling base of angry, older, more male and mostly white voters to embed their corruption in the courts and laws before the wave comes crashing down on them.;;;Nope. They're going after it because it's bait. It's dominating headlines and taking attention away from the Mueller report. ;;;Party politics 101.

Political parties are fund raising organizations, nothing more.

They seek donors, and provide the money raised to candidates who will pass / repeal legislation that benefits their donors. Sometimes they also have to adopt additional positions to add enough voters to get their candidates elected.

The modern DNC seeks small donations from large numbers of people, particularly from identifiable groups disadvantaged from current gov’t policy (I.e., ‘identity politics’).  This strategy has provided a very reliable voter base among a wide spectrum of citizens. So politicians run on, and implement after elected, social justice-related policy.

Weakened after Nixon’s resignation, very wealthy people and large corporations began donating heavily to the GOP to rebuild it and “capture” it to their interests. I have seen political contribution reports that more than half of GOP funding comes from 12 billionaires. And much of the rest of it comes from corporate donations. So it’s no surprise that elected GOP lawmakers act in the interest of their donors: the very wealthy + corporations.

The problem the GOP has, however, is that their donors’ votes don’t add up to a majority of votes in an election. So they seek groups who have an issue not being addressed by the GOP, i.e., abortion, or groups who feel threatened by the diversity in the DNC, i.e., xenophobic white people in small states. Then they add in some strategic tactics, i.e., gerrymandering congressional districts, laws that suppress voting rights for groups of people likely to vote democratic, etc. And they keep their ‘identity politics’ groups interested via a steady stream of fear propaganda from media outlets, I.e., foxnews, Sinclair, conservative radio.;;;The only thing that the GOP truly and firmly stands for are tax cuts for themselves and their wealthy donors, no other “principles” they’ve espoused for the past 30 years actually mean shit (keeping the debt/deficit low, being about law and order, protecting family values, the government not interfering with businesses and industries, spreading “democracy,” etc.). They’ll all put up with a man that cant speak or read, is emotionally volatile, and has no substantive knowledge about anything because they know they’ll end up getting their tax cuts. ;;;It goes to show that the Republicans have learned nothing from the midterms. Democrats won the House and had a decent result in the Senate because of the popularity of Obamacare!;;;It’s two things:

First, more money means more power. The more power they have, the more protected they are.

Second, retribution and punishment for Occupy Wall Street and the greater problem arising from it. The lower classes have started to question and rise up against the inequity and have the gaul to question the superiority of the ruling elite. By putting the lower classes on a survive or die footing, it will be incredibly difficult for them to overthrow anything. Especially since they will be happy for the table scraps they are occasionally thrown to keep the masses happy.

The rich don’t have bolt holes to protect themselves from nuclear war or a zombie apocalypse. They fear an uprising and purging of the aristocracy, ala France or Russia by the masses.;;;Betsy DeVos is already trying to defund the special Olympics as well.

Like repeal and replace was catchy. You could run with that. Arguably Obamacare is flawed, for some doing more harm than good, so ""here's what we are going to replace it with...""

&amp;#x200B;

But nope. My guess is because a large part of the freedom caucus believes that the government should have no role in healthcare. I'm skeptical of government intervention in the marketplace, but healthcare should not be a for profit industry. And for that exact reason is why it's one of the few areas government should be involved.

&amp;#x200B;

Just dumb, dumb dumb all around. ;;;Don't discount racism in this move. Trump is going after Obamacare because black man.

That's literally the endgame.;;;When Republicans controlled both houses and the White House they could have done whatever they wanted with Obamacare. Anything Republicans did not do during those two years, they don't actually want to do. Now that it is once again a safe empty gesture without the risk of it actually happening, they can call for its repeal again. The problem is that Obamacare has a lot of popular provisions, and if they actually repealed it voters would blame the Republicans. But a strictly theoretical  'Repeal Obamacare' plays to the base, many of whom probably rely on provisions of the ACA.

This is not a for-sale ad/post. Just looking for opinions/guidance about what I should do with it. My post got long. If you end up reading it all, thanks in advance.

I have a Delta Homecraft 8"" TS plus 4"" jointer combo I'm looking to part with. I'm looking for a reality check on how much the machine combo is worth. I never see them come up on Craigslist so I have no clue. If you think they are garbage/worthless --please tell me. I'm simply looking for info so I can figure out what to do with it.

Why am I selling: I have a 10"" Craftsman King-Seeley, 10"" DeWalt RAS and I recently found this same exact Delta combo in a 10"" tilting TS + 6"" jointer size. For me it's a no-brainer to have same size everything on all my stuff. My space is limited but if you guys come back to me and say it's worth very little I'd rather give it away to a good home than see someone part or scrap it.

The saw is 34-160 made in March of 1951 and the jointer is 37-290, made in April (or Delta said maybe very late March) of 1951. This is best picture I could find of similar saw/machine.

When I Googled I found a bunch of reddit comments from /r/woodworking with people saying everything from ""great little machine"" to ""I wouldn't pay $1 for a 4"" jointer"".

The bad about it: Nothing really other than it is 8 and 4 inch (6"" dado).
The good: I went through a few free/parts machines restoring it. It's completely restored, all new bearings, tons of spares, looks like new and it is a perfect, very reliable, dialed in machine. Best part: the trunnions are the weak link in these saws. I fabricated and machined new (steel) trunnions for it. I also have two cast iron table extensions making the table 15"" wide by 32"" long (infeed/outfeed) with wooden extensions 6"" to operator's left of blade and 12"" to operator's right of blade. As currently configured it is a 33x32 8"" tilting table saw, with 4"" jointer. It's a very small footprint and an excellent way to fit a TS+jointer in a shop.

I have several fences for the saw. I welded two Delta fences together to make a fence for the 32"" table. I also have the stock/original 18"" and 25"" long fences as well as a 25"" fence with blade relief cutout (came on the really old models). I have a spare motor, both motors have good start caps (single phase 120/240 1/2hp motors), one has new motor bearings, saw comes with link belts (the good ones not HF).

Have several good 8"" &amp; 8-1/4"" blades and a bunch of OK blades that range from 7-1/4"" to 8-1/4"". Have three VERY NEW Forest blades, couple big-box red blades and a variety of other blades &amp; accessories: thin/standard kerf, couple old finish/cabinet blades with stiffener plates, etc. All of my good blades have never been sent out to be resharpened so still have life in them. Couple featherboards, have a bunch of different sleds and jigs specific to the 8"" saw and that Delta fence. Forest 6"" dado stack, have original blade guard, saw came to me with an aftermarket riving knife. (I took it off but that'll go with the saw too.) I think that's about it. Don't have the original Delta push/pull rod for on/off, original switch is down at the motor and at some point it was converted over to a light switch for on/off. Two pulley motor so both jointer and TS spin at same time.

Jointer is perfect. Flat, straight, accurate, etc. Has new bearings. Knives in it are sharp (perfectly even and no nail marks/gouges). I've got a bunch of NOS replacement knives as well as a pile of old that could be re-sharpened. TS and Jointer have original chip/dust chutes and I made 4"" DC attachments for them in a wye with blast gates at each machine (so when using jointer the TS is closed). Have push blocks for jointer too.

I am the third owner of the saw/jointer: Original owner, his son and then me. Several years ago it was given to me (in rough shape) so I have even less of a clue what it might or might not be worth.

After typing all that I feel like I'm screwed. The dado stack alone was $400 and I'm realizing that this is a small, entry level ts/jointer. I realize no one is going to pay $1,000 for it but at same time I built my house with it (cabinets, furnature, etc.). It's a really solid saw &amp; jointer. (also a really small jointer which is half the reason why I wanted the bigger TS/jointer machine)

Am I screwed? In my head I think $400 is probably a reasonable ask --a steal for the buyer and a fair price for me to part with it. At same time I'm thinking no one is ever going to pay $400 for it --which is insane because the dado stack alone cost me $400. The Dado stack plus Forest blades were over $800.

I've noticed most people connect to the tool with plastic flex hose, and the Clearvue CV 1800 connects to the pipe via a plastic body. Does the metal just not build up a static charge like PVC does, do people ground it on one end with wire, or am I missing something else here?

Ideally, I'd like to be able to use the plunge base to drop the bit down through the wood, and then immediately be able to lock the depth and move everything sideways to cut a channel in cases 2 and 3. But it looks like a lot of bits are only designed for the sideways movement - is there a type I should be looking for that I can use for all of these cases? Or do I need separate bits for plunging versus cutting a channel?;;;How much to restore a 14"" Unisaw (1ph 220)? 


Saw is free. I'm told it runs and comes with ""box of accessories"". From the pictures I can see it has a fence. That's all I know. Table doesn't look terrible. ;;;Hi, I'm trying to restore a couple of 60 year old hardwood chairs. By restore i mean mostly sanding the old oil finish down to the bare wood (the chairs have seen absolutely no maintenance in 60 years so applying oil over the old layer is out of the question. They're absolutely ugly, the oil turned completely black in some spots, it wiped off on others from daily use, but the wood underneath is intact.) It seems to me like they're hard maple, but I might be completely wrong. Anyhow, after some brief testing, starting with 80 grit sandpaper to knock down the surface layer and then switching to a 180 grit and then 240 to smoothen the pieces works best for me, but the old oil turned black in some areas and impregnated into the fibers, leaving a very dirty/dusty look. It's not very deep, so sanding it works fine, but even with 80 grit, sanding them out takes a very long time. (I'm sanding by hand.) Any advice to get them out a bit faster ? Should I go for a lower grit?;;;Quick dust collector question. I’m working with a budget. For cleanliness and longevity of equipment, would I be better off with the harbor freight DC, or a smaller WEN DC ran through cyclones? The WEN DC is still 4”, so I was thinking of dual 2” cyclones (it’s not in my budget for a 4” cyclone unfortunately).  Being just myself, I probably wouldn’t need more than 650 cfm ;;;I went to a woodcraft supply store where they had a bin of cutoffs, I dont know what kind any of them are.

I'm finding that the dado walls are slightly deeper then the middle (i.e. not perfectly square and flat). What am I doing wrong? The stack is from Grizzly and the description says flat and square. Thanks. ;;;I'm doing some craft stuff and need to find a screw that will:

- Pointy tipped (maybe not necessary? maybe I could drill pilot holes and use a flat-tipped screw)
- Fit through a 5 mm hole
- Will go 1 cm deep
- Has a pan head (round top, flat on the side that meets the surface)

The material will be some kind of hardwood, probably walnut.

Have I done goofed and put myself in a situation where it's super hard or impossible to get the part I need?;;;[Looking for my first table saw and found this](https://imgur.com/a/ZGnDz3Y) seller wants $250 for it. He said it was 10"" and about 6-8 years old, but he didn't know the model number, what sort of motor it had or really anything else. It looks like it might be a model 22114 which seemed to get generally positive reviews.

 I don't really know what I'm doing though so I guess I'm just looking for other people's thoughts. Does $250 sound like a reasonable price? Anything in particular I should look out for?;;;Man i hate being such a pain in the ass.

Do I need to use a bandsaw (all I have is a jigsaw that I don't love) or can I do this on the table saw? ;;;Hello, I live in an apartment and have been wanting to start woodworking as a hobby so I have decided to go the handtools route as much as possible. I have about $100 I can put towards tools (handsaw, chisels, etc) but have no idea what to get. I won't be strictly handtools as I already have a circular saw and power drill, but would like to spend this $100 on non-electric tools. I also already have clamps, triangle, dowell jig. Can anyone recommend good handsaws, chisels, plane to get me started? I was looking online but kinda overwhelmed especially in the variety of handsaws.;;;Hello am new to the hobby, I  was browsing a local online market place and found a Miter Saw for 100 USD  the picture with the part number mentioned N.G tools  4500 RPM    2100 W  also the same guy is selling a Hitachi Circular Saw   C7  18.5 mm (no price)  

What you guys think about the tools and the price;;;Building some oak picture frames, but don't have the ability to make a spline jig. What else cane I do to reinforce the corner joints?;;;Sharpening question!

So I splurged on a Tormek T-4 since I dread sharpening my chisels and handplanes, and I grabbed the square tool (with the micro-adjustment).  I stupidly went in head first with a nice chisel and did a number on the squareness.  Don't get me wrong, incredibly sharp, but way out of square.  Even after a bunch of tweaks I couldn't get it perfectly 90 degrees.  I swapped to a cheaper chisel, and I think due to my adjustments, I was able to get a straight 90 degree edge.

Here's my question, what's the best way to get my nicer chisel back to 90 degrees?  I was trying to do it on my Tormek but I can't seem to get it right.  I think I need to get it back to 90 degrees before returning to the Tormek to sharpen it.  Would straight 60/80 grit sandpaper and a flat surface be my best bet?;;;I'm new to wood working and built a dice tray which I want to line with some fabric backed vinyl. Problem is, I already put Try and True wood finish without thinking about how to adhere it to the wood. I started to try E600 glue but it seemed to slip right off the finish. Any suggestions for a glue I can use to adhere this to the finished wood? Or do I need to try and sand it down back to the wood to be able to glue it?;;;Sawstop Promo processing time?

I'm pursuing a new  bunch of handsaws and I'm unsure if the quality of one lie Nielsen trumps the diversity of the 3piece veritas set.

The veritas is dovetail saw, fine dovetail saw and the crosscut saw vs the Nielsen dovetail saw.

Any input anyone could give here would be nice. Thanks.;;;Looking for an identity on this wood: 

Here is the end grain:
https://i.imgur.com/KHL7eBp.jpg

Side grain: https://i.imgur.com/MjIWHi2.jpg

It was being used to rack drilling pipe, and likely came from somewhere other than western Canada. Seems to wet easily, though it is likely quite rot resistant. 

It cuts nicely and has crisp edges, though it warps quickly after cutting. It is heavy, dense, and has a floury, slightly yellowish sawdust. Some sort of subpar hardwood I'd guess, useful for shipping but not really woodworking? 

Nevertheless, I like it, and I'm going to try make a tiny box with the stuff. I'll sneak up on my dimensions, letting it rest for a few days, and that will hopefully deal with the warpage.

t2_ivzyj,"Nice! I built the [same one](https://imgur.com/dbzGYqG) last year. I stained it with minwax and then did three coats of spar urethane and the spar urethane is all peeling off from only one Michigan summer... I would recommend just hitting it with a clear coat of some sort of outdoor sealant or if you’re set on staining use an outdoor deck stain. 

I wish I would’ve kept the look of the wood on mine, I regret staining it :( [Here it is with the stain](https://imgur.com/a/SPPuf01);;;My son and daughter helped me start this last year.

I think it would be cool to try extending the top three pieces of each backrest across the gap where the center table is. It wouldn’t be a functional addition, but I feel like that would link the two chairs in cool bench kind of way.

Be proud of yourself for doing it!;;;If that was first year in competition, look out next year.  ;;;It's understandable that he's bummed. When you put your heart and soul into something knowing full well it's going to be judged it's hard when you don't go as far in the competition as you wanted.

That being said, it's a great thing just to compete. To bring your A game and be passionate about your work. Tell him that most people will never even know that passion and he should never give up on that.

And tell him to absolutely DESTROY it next year.
Congrats in advance!!;;;That looked amazing. Tell him he should be proud of his product and to keep on woodworking.  The important thing to point out is that just because he didn't win doesn't mean what he made isn't 
worthwhile, but maybe it wasn't EXACTLY what the judges were looking for.

Hell, I'm proud for him.;;;Very impressive! Was the wood burned by hand or is that a feature of the grain that was exemplified;;;Alright man, I'm gonna need some details here (I'm probably triple your son's age).

Can you ask him, or better yet have him reply.

- are those the natural grains in the wood and did get them darker by applying some heat / fire to them? Or did he design them himself?

- how did he get the stars so neat and perfect?

- what wood did he use as it looks beautiful.

Brilliant job!

PS, he rocks the f*** out of those glasses.

PPS, you're a great dad my man.

It's nice. ;;;Tell your boy that this sub can be sometimes be intimidating for younger dudes just trying to get a feel for it. I’m 21 and often feel like I’ll have to be 35 before I can make a coffee table. Seeing younger dudes making good liking shit gives me more confidence to go out and try my best. 

Also tell him he’s lucky to have a parent that supports him in his interests and is this invested. ;;;48 here. Been a woodworker for 15 years. That’s a great job. Make sure he knows to keep going, and if he likes the end result, then that’s all that matters. ;;;Can’t see how something Hank Hill would be proud of didn’t place.  I would be proud to hang that in my home.  Make a decent offer and good shipping and I’ll commission one ASAP.  Tell him good on him.;;;Damn, what the hell was he up against?! Haha I think he did great!! ;;;He who seeks the approval of others will always be disappointed in themselves. ;;;It's really good work and does look good. Not knowing what else was there I'd say maybe it was to simplistic or not original enough. Either way just keep encouraging him to keep at it. If he's that good now he'll be placing sometime in the future. ;;;Good for him! Perhaps it's been overdone recently.;;;It looks nice, but it would help if you could tell us what we're looking at.  If possible I’d prefer to offer constructive criticism rather than sympathies.  Obviously your son has a good feel for the torch and the project looks great.

Criticism below:

It looks like he glued up 2x4s for the stripes and glued in a plywood square for the star field.  The red paint goes astray in several places (did he tape?), and in such a way that it looks like he left the corner radii on the 2x4s (maybe that’s why taping didn’t work?).  He could have squared, burned and painted/stained the 2x4 prior to glue up to ensure that the surfaces were flat, he was happy with the burns and that the paint seams would be super tight (as long as he didn’t use too much glue and cleaned up the squeeze-out well).

The seam on the right edge of the starfield looks good.

The left edge of the starfield is all torn out.  Sharper blades, masking tape, or scoring the top with a utility knife and a straight edge can eliminate this.

On closer inspection I have to say some of the stars look a bit wonky.  Cutting the edges with a chisel prior to using the Dremel would’ve sharpened them up a lot, I think.

My personal opinion is that the competition likely displayed more joinery, surface treatment (planning/shaping) and carving.  I think this project would look better with stain (as opposed to paint, which this looks like) especially in the context of a woodworking contest.

End of the day though, people would happily buy that and mount it on the wall.;;;[removed];;;[removed];;;Life is full of disappointments.  Get used to it.  Get over it.  Get better.

This is an excellent life lesson for the young man.  ;;;Looks  great to me. ;;;Great Job - wood buy from him.  Keep up the great work.

Looking forward to seeing more of his work on here.  Good stuff 👍;;;That’s amazing. He is very skilled and should be proud. Hopefully he continues to perfect his craft and he can win next year. ;;;I would buy it lol would make a bad ass end table for my man cave ;;;That's awesome.

That’s something to be proud of. Please let him know that folks in LA are admiring his craftsmanship!;;;He did a damn good job, honestly I believe the judges (at least in our area) are really picking on the torch distress for some reason and that could be the only reason he was docked. It looks fantastic, especially for his age.;;;It it beautiful! ;;;How did he not place? It looks awesome!;;;Wow!! Just wow!! He’s found his talent so early and I’ve been building custom pieces for 15 years and that is so cool. Great Job bud, keep it up!!;;;Please tell him I'd proudly clear a wall to display his work and to always take pride in the results of his efforts.;;;Doesn't matter that he didn't place.  He made a cool flag.  I am in my twenties and I've never made anything.  I WISH I could do something cool like this.  If I made something that looked that nice I would be showing all of my friends like ""DO YOU SEE WHAT I MADE!"";;;Looks awesome ;;;Incredible!!!! You keep up the hard work and keep your chin up.

Because you obviously have some serious skills!;;;That’s amazing work, he should definitely keep his head held high. I’m not even subbed to woodworking but based on the comments some of the work involved is very hard to do. Crazy that he could achieve this his first year. Keep it up big man, who knows what you could end up doing with your talent!;;;I zoomed in, and I could tell that the stars were all done by hand, no easy feat.  Its definitlwy somethjg to be proud of.;;;I failed at making a box yesterday. Your son rocks. ;;;Must be a tough competition!;;;The enjoyment comes from creation not adulation. A job well done is its own satisfaction.;;;The most important thing is not that he competes and places,  it that he continues to nurture his passions and his skill set over time. Life isn’t about winning any single event , it’s about the journey, and it’s a long one if you’re lucky. His work is beautiful. ;;;He should be very proud of what he had done! That is amazing!;;;There is few better motivators them disappointment! Project looks fine, imo flag has been overdone and part of woodworking is to make unique creations. It can be very simple if executed flawlessly. ;;;I just got my next project idea :) looks great!;;;Man, that is absolutely gorgeous!! The grain of that wood makes it look like the flag is blowing in the wind! 10/10, dude. ;;;Would be more than happy to hang this in my house.;;;Awesome piece 

It’ll fetch $150+ 

I would go down to the local feed store and ask them if they would hang it up and sell it.  People love handmade in The USA 🇺🇸 ;;;I'd say most people twice his age couldn't make that but id say most people period couldn't make that.  He should be very proud and go at it again next year.;;;He didn't place because it was a kids competition and that's the work of someone who's been doing it for 10+ years. Fantastic work right there.;;;My dear friend, please, please, please don’t view the fact that you didn’t place as in any way that your hand-made work of art isn’t beautiful and valuable.  It is, because *YOU* made it and you are beautiful and valuable.  Trust me, I’m old. I know. ;;;Looks really good!! 

Though I supposed I'd have to say - If something THIS good didn't place, must've been some SERIOUS competition, eh?;;;[removed];;;I can't imagine, as a parent, seeing my kid make something as incredible as this piece of artwork, only to have his confidence take a blow just because of a silly competition. Plus he even got all dressed up!!! This is an incredible masterpiece, and I can only hope he has the next one planned out. Please post his future projects! He has a real talent!!!

Is that a bald eagle’s face burned into the blue stars part or am I just seeing things?;;;I love it!!  He should be proud. ;;;i wouldn't call that a very original, or complicated/challenging, piece of work

and it tries to cater to a low common denominator

just my thoughts;;;The scorching is amazing, the stain/dye tints are amazing, the star inlays that look like they were difficult and tedious are amazing, and the whole piece is amazing because it recreates something so iconic but still let’s you know it’s a natural material. 

There are many freedom loving Americans out there that would pay GOOD money to have that on their wall.  Please encourage him to keep creating and please keep sharing his work. ;;;That is a beautiful piece of 1st place woodwork. Follow your passion &amp; keep up the great work.;;;Judges Don always understand the work that goes into a flag. Dremeling out stars??? There is no way that I would ever attempt something like that.

t2_5at1eli,"Just asking because I really don't know, but will you run into problems with the wood expanding/contracting with it being so tight? When happens when the wood swells in the summer?;;;Great question.

I’ll try to keep it simple, I wrote a longer explanation/response previously but I lost it somehow..

The box is not as tight fitting as it appears.  It’s mostly the air escaping that is slowing it’s descent to the bottom.

Also the species matters, this is 100+year old (after milling) redwood that is very stable and well seasoned.  I find that bald cypress or western red cedar are also similar in their stability even in humid environments.  I wouldn’t make one of these from oak for example..

Lastly, I live in south Florida.  We don’t have the same wild contrast in seasons like there is up north.  No freeze/thaw or big temperature differentials.  Although it is humid almost all year round, the central A/C keeps the house in the same range from month to month.  This works to my advantage, but I would bet this might be a problem if I lived in Massachusetts for example.

When I make things like this I also try to be as precise as possible and take the error of a less than perfect corner or inconsistent thicknesses out of the equation.  For example, I put all the pieces through my drum sander before assembly to make them the same exact thickness across the length and consistent with each other, this really helps.  Back before I had a drum sander I would make my planks on the table saw and then hand plane/sand.  As nice as my work looked I would often still have binding because of inconsistencies in thickness.  All of that stuff really adds up.

I hope this was helpful, thanks for asking the important questions.;;;What's this going to be for OP?
