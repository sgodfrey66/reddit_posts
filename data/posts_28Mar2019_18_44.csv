My husband loves to play PC games with his mates all the time. He works a 9-5 comes home plays games until he comes to bed in the early hours of the morning when I’ve already fallen asleep. On the weekends he plays all day. He doesn’t do many duties around the house and I try to give him one job to do (e.g. a round of washing) before getting on games but he usually doesn’t do it saying that he has to get on now because everyone else is on.
I can understand wanting to play games for enjoyment and to relax but I’m starting to feel really lonely. I feel like I hardly see him even though he’s in the house and he also never wants to talk about anything. Honestly the last proper conversation we had that I can recall was on Saturday and it’s now Thursday. I spend my weeknights and weekends alone watching Netflix, reading and cleaning.
I don’t know how to broach the subject of his gaming or if people think it’s not a serious problem? Every time I try he just has the argument “well your lucky I don’t spend my time out drinking”. I don’t know what to do please give me some advice.

TL;DR! My husband plays videos games non stop, I’m starting to feel lonely in the relationship. How do I broach the subject?",relationships,My [28/F] husband [28/M] plays video games non stop and I’m starting to feel lonely in the relationship
t2_2ywjm7if,1553794298.0,b6lpu6,t3_b6lpu6,193,"We have been married for a year, together for 2. Just 2 days ago when he was signing into his phone I noticed him quickly exit an app he just using. That app was tinder.   

I had just worked a 15 hour day, and saw this within the first half hour of arriving at home. I had an immediate melt down. He wouldn't stop insisting he did nothing wrong because he had no intentions of meeting these people. That he found it as an entertaining pass time.   

I still can't believe he doesn't see anything wrong with this. I asked him to show me his tinder. He has been using this app since November. Which had me melt down even further.   

I've told him if he doesn't see an issue with this when I clearly do. I cannot continue this relationship with him. I am unhappy.   

For some extra context. We haven't been intimate for over a month. He will use my weight as the reason why he hasn't been as sexually attracted to me. So seeing him on tinder was another blow to my self esteem. Not only am I with a jealous man who would accuse me of being the cheater, he would also put me down because of my weight, in addition to ending sexy times because I've refused to give him anal. So finding him on tinder messaging young and thin women is really fucking with my head.   

Today. Still. He is defending himself. Not giving me clear answers on why he sees the need to use this app. Why he's been on it since November. He won't even tell me if he's either deactivated or deleted the account he has now. Making it clear he has intentions of continuing to use it. I feel so fucking heart broken. I cannot even look at him the same.   

Last night he was laughing at me because I was ""overreacting"" and still isn't taking me seriously when I say I don't want him anymore. I feel so broken down. I hate to say that I do still want him. It's become one of those cliche, my heart wants him but my brain is saying no.   

I feel so lost. How do you people actually stick by your word when you say it's over? It already feels so difficult. I know if I just forgive him. This is just going to happen all over again. But I already feel so burnt out. I just want to give up.   

TLDR; husband sees no issue with using tinder as a pass time. He's saying I'm overreacting as he hasn't done anything with anyone off the app.",relationships,My (25F) husband (30M) says there's nothing wrong with using tinder to pass time.
t2_3hwpjjxa,1553785077.0,b6jsvh,t3_b6jsvh,244,"A little background - I'm 32, have 3 kids with my ex-wife (married 7 years). My girlfriend and I have been dating a hair over 3 years.

Legally my ex and I have 50/50 custody, however I have the kids a bit more than she does. She's not the most responsible person, and by her own admission, she isn't the most maternal person either. She enjoys going out and drinking, partying, etc. We have a good relationship, even though it often times feels like she's another child as opposed to the mother of my kids. Regardless, we have a custody agreement that we both agree on. I make about 3x as much as she does so I'm legally obligated to pay her child support even though we officially have 50/50 custody. I'm totally and 100% ok with that. 

Enter my girlfriend. Everything is going good, we have a great relationship, and the kids love her. She's not a huge fan of my ex, simply because of her lack of parenting skills, but keeps it to herself (and me). 

My biggest irritation in the entire world is how, anytime I do anything for my kids, she has to make some snarky comment(s) about my ex.

Got my daughter a phone for her 10th birthday. 
""Is their mom going to help pay for that?""

Get a call from school, leave work to pick up a sick kid. 
""It just pisses me off how much you do for your kids and how little she does for them""

My son calls me when he's at his mom's to get help with his homework. 
""Can his mom not even handle helping him? Is she that dumb?""

I love helping him with his homework - it's one of our things!

She constantly makes snide comments about how I have them more than she does yet I have to pay child support.

I do the things I do for my kids because I'm their dad, it's my job to take care of them. Why does everything I do always have to be compared to what she *doesn't* do for them? What am I gonna do, tell the school ""sorry, their mom needs to take more responsibility so I will not be picking my son up from school"" like wtf? 

I've brought this up before, about how I don't appreciate her turning everything I do for my kids into an attack on their mom, and if she feels the need to comment on it, maybe shift her thinking to a more positive mindset and tell me how cool it is that I do what I do for my kids. It doesn't seem to sink in.


TL;DR 
My girlfriend compares everything I do for my kids to how little their mom does and I don't see why it matters. They're my kids FFS.

How should I approach this and let her know it's starting to chip away at our relationship? Am I overreacting? Do I need to look at things through her point of view? Any and all advice is welcome and greatly appreciated.

Edit 1: I don't necessarily think it's unfair that I have to pay child support. It's not much, and it's meant to supplement the income difference between our households. A part of me thinks it's dumb that I have to pay, but considering I'm a divorced dad in the Midwest I think I have it pretty good. It's 2019 but the courts are still mainly (around here at least) anti-father. In my case my divorce lawyer even warned me that the judge handling our case was notoriously against fathers, for whatever reason. With that, my ex and I came to an agreed upon custody schedule. If we couldn't have done to an agreement, it would've been up to the court to decide, and that could have potentially ended very badly for me. 

Edit 2: Thank you all so much for your advice. I am taking everything into consideration and am trying to come up with an un-objective (that's a word, right?) way to approach the situation in order to have a mature and honest discussion with my GF this weekend. Here's hoping that we are able to listen to one-another's concerns and come out stronger than before.",relationships,My (32M) girlfriend (29F) keeps using things I do for my kids as ammo to attack my ex-wife
t2_8kmws,1553753245.0,b6f75y,t3_b6f75y,128,"I have a twin brother, which I can honestly say it has been good and bad as I've grown up. When we got out of college, I went to get a master's degree and my brother went into a post Bach program for a medical field, but he moved away from the state we grew up in. Since he has moved away, it's always felt rough to me because even though I get to spend more time with my parents since we are in the same area, they always talk about him when I'm around and it makes me feel less than adequate. To the point where when I see them once a month or so, they always bring up ""we should FaceTime your brother"", even though I don't see them a lot.

So my brother met his now wife in school, then moved to her state once they both finished their medical programs. The wedding was a bit tense, as my Mom didn't really get along great with my brother's wife or her Mom. But after the wedding, they established themselves in his wife's home state and recently bought a house. We all visit them once in a while when we can, but it's not easy because of the distance.

I haven't always had a great relationship with my parents, especially after my brother left. But recently I thought it was okay and I was trying to spend more time with them and help them out when I could, and I was looking forward to spending my birthday with them as it's coming up and I'm turning the big 3-0. I was talking to my brother today, and he told me that they had bought tickets to visit him over our birthday weekend, and it caught me off guard. On the one hand, I want them to be able to see him and spend his birthday with them, but at the same time they didn't say anything to me and it hurts a lot. I haven't spelled out the whole background with my parents here, but I've had multiple conversations with them about how I sometimes feel valued less than my brother because of their actions, and they mostly have responded negativey and told me I'm being too sensitive.

Writing this out I feel like I'm just whining a lot, ""my parents don't love me as much as my twin brother,"" but I really have felt like I have put so much effort into my relationship with my parents and trying to be there for them and help them when they ask for help, where as my brother has always done his own thing and they seem to cater to him. It's been seriously hurting my self esteem, and making me want to step back slightly from my relationship with my parents. I don't think I can talk to them about this, because of how they've responded before. I'm not sure if I'm asking for advice, or more just writing this down to see how it feels when I read this back, but I any advice would be appreciated. Thanks. 

tl;dr:

Recently they booked a trip to see him during our 30th birthday without telling me, and it feels like it's the last straw.

t2_3akkhafg,1553815140.0,b6pw4l,t3_b6pw4l,51,"So I noticed my cousin was affectionate and flirting with this boy during a neighborhood party last weekend. I don't think there's any good reason for a 14 year old to be flirting with a 20 year old. I don't even think there's a good reason for them to talk to each other like that, so I interfered. I just went there and told my cousin that her mom was looking for her, took her to my aunt and uncle, told them what happened and they asked me to take her home.

I took her some advice, told her that it's not appropriate or safe for her to be talking to boys that are that much older than her. She said she likes talking to boys and I told her that she should just hang out with boys who are her own age, that's fine. She seemed to understand it, I'm sure my uncle and aunt will give her the same advice.

Once I was back to the party, I told my girlfriend what happened. Earlier today, she came to me and accused me of overstepping my bounds and being controlling towards my cousin, saying I'm ""baby""ing her and she should make her own decisions. I don't agree with this mindset, I think I was just looking out for her and it was for her own good. She's 14 and can be stupid (like I was at that age). Girlfriend believes I have no rights to make that judgement.

She has demanded that I apologize to my cousin and promise her that this will not happen again, and I really can't make that promise nor am I going to apologize, because I don't think I did anything wrong and I'd do it again.

t2_3hxten3e,1553804140.0,b6npzd,t3_b6npzd,47,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for a few years now, and for the most part I have been quite happy. We've talked about and planned the rest of our lives together and see eye-to-eye on a lot of things. And for years we would have to drive 40 minutes to see one another, so we were really excited to be living with each other since it would make things more casual and easy. A few months ago we moved into an apartment together, we had a lot of fun picking out the furniture and setting everything up, and I was anticipating things becoming even better than they were. And I think, from her perspective, they probably are.

But I friggin' hate it. She cleans up after herself and everything, and she is pretty easygoing, but that's the extent of my happiness about it. I think living with her kind of sucks? It's only been a few months but I already find her presence to be oppressive and boring. She is always asking me what I want to do, or what I want to eat for dinner, and I constantly feel as if I need to entertain her. It's like it's up to me to be the interesting or exciting one, as if it's something I even want from *myself*. She makes unhealthy snacks and then pressures me into eating them even though I am trying to be healthier, asking me over and over again if I want them even when I politely decline repeatedly. And this is probably on me, but I feel guilty and pressured to drink or smoke when she is doing so around me. Her cat scratches my furniture. She broke my food processor. She told me she didn't want me to have a group of friends over while she was away because she didn't want that many people in ""her space."" She sleeps until noon. I have to feed her cat and water her plants when she's gone, which is half the time. 

I think all of these alone would be fine, and simple enough to solve with conversations, but when you put them all together on top of all of the other small adjustments and concessions you seem to have to make when you live with someone (like the softness of the bed, or the layout of the kitchen, or whether you're allowed to fall asleep listening to audiobooks, or how the hell you're going to masturbate with someone in the other room and a cat watching you or scratching at the door) it starts to feel insurmountable.

I don't understand what happened. I love this woman, but I am beginning to hate being around her. She goes away for work a lot of the time and I find myself far more excited about when she's away than when she's here; when she's gone it's as if I'm free: I go to weird events with friends she doesn't like or work on side projects with them, and have time to read and write in quiet peace without feeling guilty about ignoring her. 

I don't think that I didn't know what kind of person she was until I moved in with her? Perhaps I didn't know myself well enough. I thought her sleeping in would be endearing, maybe. I thought I wouldn't mind sharing my life with someone and maybe I do? Or is this all standard growing pains when you move in with someone? I need to make this work but half of the time I stare into her loving eyes and can't help but think about how badly I want to jump headfirst out of a window. I can't imagine I wouldn't be immensely happier if she lived down the block instead of in my apartment. Why would anyone ever want to live with anyone else?

He finally committed after a few years, but he was an absolutely shitty boyfriend. Major issues included his emotional (and unconfirmed physical) cheating and aggressive bullying when he wouldn’t get his way. Our final breaking point was him screaming at me during my graduation party in front of our families and friends. Everyone was pretty upset by the scene he caused, especially his younger brother, Ryan, who had also become my friend by that point.

t2_3hyy42rq,1553806239.0,b6o51y,t3_b6o51y,22,"A decade ago my mother brought over her siblings from Africa (through some chain migration shit) to the U.S. She had grown up away from them, after having been given away by her parents to her maternal aunt, and when these siblings came over she had this idealized vision of them in her head. Anyway, they came over and everyone got in a big fight and went their separate ways. My mother, who was a single mother, had been expecting her siblings to help out and be a resource and had this fanciful idea of sibling solidarity, however, her siblings were interested in self-advancement and did not seem to show whatever ""gratitude"" my mother expected from them for her effort in bringing them from a hellish situation in a bad part of Africa to the U.S, an effort that cost her many thousands of dollars. I was a kid then and none of this was my business.

Anyway, one of these siblings was my uncle and he lived with us for two or three years when he first arrived. After that he left to another state and I never heard from him again. Anyway, now I'm older and one of his children (still in Africa) has reached out to me on Facebook. He says his old man (my uncle) is out of work and he wants me to send him some money for ""books.""

I'm a young professional, with not a whole lot of money, and unlike my mother, I'm not sure I want to spend my working years sending money to unknown relatives in Africa (i'd rather save for retirement).

My boyfriend lives in a 3 bedroom apartment with his good guy friend and there’s a third bedroom for a roommate. About 8 months ago my boyfriend’s really nice female roommate, let’s call her Alana, who had the 3rd bedroom, had to move out. She was great, I really liked her so this sucks.

They found a new roommate, Natalie. From the beginning, I had a funny feeling about Natalie. My boyfriend talked about her a lot and showed me a pic of her (she’s pretty). I almost immediately got the vibe that he was much more interested in her as a person and possibly was attracted to her. She's very much 'his type'. Anyway, I ignored my feelings.

Then it was Natalie’s birthday and she was upset because the guy she was seeing flaked on their plans, so she was alone on her birthday. My boyfriend went out and bought her a cake and a card. This made me really upset, because on the first birthday he and I were together he didn’t get me anything, let alone a cake and a card - and he had known Natalie for about 5 minutes, and she isn’t his girlfriend!

 Before we got married my parents were supporting in our relationship and we hanged out from time to time. My husband had never been the type to be too close with anyone beside his parents and sister, but he made an effort for me to go to dinners at my parents, and we even went for a Venice trip on my mother's 50th birthday. On the other hand, I was much closer to his family, sometimes hanging out even with his extended family when I was back in my hometown.

The wedding preparations started and everything went smoothly, and despite my anxious personality I was surprised by how calm I was those days (in our culture the wedding lasts almost a week). In one of the days proceeding the main ceremony some members of my husband's family had to come to my house to bring gifts, and my father was supposed to meet them at the entrance, but they came earlier than they said they would so he was unable to greet them, they entered without him and he only came after. After this happened he came to me visibly altered, telling me he felt disrespected. I felt a bit sad that he felt that way but I told him they didn't mean to be disrespectful.

2 days later came the  most important day of the wedding, when the husband's family comes to the bride's family house to take the bride. This time I specifically asked my mother in law to not come before 2 pm, because I had pictures to take with my family. There are around 10 cars full of people coming so I understood that it was difficult to manage but I asked only for this, it didn't matter if they came late, just not too early. 

What I'll write now is an account I got from many people, as I was not present.
Before they started a singer had to come to our house to set up his position, my father was dealing with him and he was being fussy about certain things so that made my father frustrated, and that's when my husband's family came, 10 minutes before 2 pm. My father went to the front entrance and shouted at the women who had gathered so they would start sing and dance, saying they were early. My father in law went inside to see what was happening and my father was still angry saying they were doing this on purpose to piss him off. My FIL got angry too and said they would go away if that's what he wanted, thus ending the cerimonies. Thankfully my uncles calmed my father down and convinced everyone I didn't deserve to have my wedding ruined over this.

In the meanwhile I was upstairs taking pics, I did realise they had come early but I was unaware of what was happening so when I saw my mother crying I assumed it was because of the stress and the fact we didn't have much time, I reassured her saying I would go downstairs when I felt ready so it didn't matter they had come early.

In all of this my future husband was waiting at home for us, as it's tradition that he is to await for his wife to come there. He was also unaware of anything that had happened at out house, and my mother in law instructed everyone that knew what had happened to not tell us two anything to not ruin our wedding reception.

The night was great and we had a lot of fun, but the next morning his father broke down in tears and told him what had happened, he said he felt humiliated by my father. My husband didn't tell me anything at first because I had another day of cerimonies ahead and he didn't want to ruin my day, but when he told me in the evening I was crushed.

What followed were weeks and weeks of hearing people's perspective of what had happaned and trying to smooth things out. My father in law eventually accepted my father's apoligies (he had regretted what he had done immediately after).
The thing that was most heartbreaking for me was that he had always been for me the example of what a good hearted man was like. It took me three months to forgive my father, but I did eventually because up to that day he had never done anything to hurt me, and I could not ignore a lifetime of good he had done to me for a 10 minute anger fit, no matter how much pain those 10 minuted had caused me.

The problem was and still is my husband. He refuses to see him and he doesn't want to do anything with him, even if his father has gone past this. My parents don't come to our house, they've been only once but my husband refused to show up, I go at least once a week at my parents but he never meets them. There have been times they saw each other and talked just for 2 or 3 minutes just because he was forced to, but that's it. My father is living in regret and has tried so many times to fix this, but my husband refuses. I have talked to him, but he won't listen. He says he wants me to have a normal relationship with them but just asks me to not involve him in it. On the other hand I go along with his parents just fine.

I cannot accept this, I live a double life, one with my husband and one with my parents, the two worlds cannot come together and it's becoming too much for me. I want to be able to have dinner together and share our life together. I am also worried that my husband may be using this as an excuse to never having to deal with them anymore, as he wasn't keen to many outings before our wedding anyway (but I don't think he would do that to me)

After saying all this I must point out that beside this problem my husband and I have the most wonderful relationship together. Besides our traditional families we live a western lifestyle and we can be completely free with each other, so we only comply with the traditional aspect of our families when we have to.

I am a very forgivng person and he's not so I don't know how I can make him understand that for me this situation cannot be permanent.  Any kind of insight would be helpful.

We've been friends for a while and started dating a few weeks ago, after having had a thing for a few months. We would always make out and do things for me (orally), but when I tried to do things to her she would always say no and be really resistant. I never forced anything on her, I thought maybe she just wasn't ready for that yet but now I found out the real reason. So apparently she has HSV-1 (oral herpes) on her genitals, and she got it from being eaten out by a boyfriend who had it. I've done a lot of research, and I guess it isn't that bad, it's not as bad as HSV-2 which is a much more volatile strain and has way more outbreaks and is just overall worse. Apparently she got it about a year ago, got it tested and found out, and hasn't had an outbreak since the initial one and even then it was just a few bumps that hurt. That being said I know she could be having outbreaks in her cervix and just not be aware of it, she said once she was having a PH imbalance issue which might have just been an outbreak she wasn't aware of. Anyway, I need some advice. I heard that as long as she's on the antiviral meds some couples don't even wear a condom?!? I think I'm always gonna wear a condom and avoid sex during her period cause I'm sure more blood involved probably makes things much more risky. Is this a deal breaker to any of you? If she's on meds and I wear protection do we have anything to worry about? Just want some help from people that have been through this or a say from someone who isn't blinded by love like I probably am...

TL:DR She has Oral herpes on her genitals and I'm just looking for advice from people who have been through something like this OR just people who can look from an outside perspective at this more reasonably.

My wife and I were good friends our whole lives and started to date near the end of high school.

We went to the same college together and all through out college there was never a doubt in my mind i would marry this woman. I proposed our senior year of college and got married a week after graduation.

Then 4 months later her mom killed herself.

I tried to be the most supportive husband i could be. I did what ever i think could have helped to ease the suffering she was going through, I tried going out to eat more, taking more vacations, being available for venting/crying etc... She didn't get sad or depressed, she got angry instead. She started lashing out at me frequently for small things. One time she loudly berating me at a restaurant for ""looking at her like i'm scared of her"".

I suggested several times that her and her sister should go see a therapist. She refused every time. I pushed the issue hard one night and her response troubled me, ""I know exactly what to tell a therapist to trick them into thinking i'm fine, so its useless for me to go."" I didn't bring it up again.

I started to see a therapist about a year later for my worsening anxiety and depression issues. I felt my therapist leading me down the path that this anxiety and depression is stemming from myself not getting what i need in a partner.

I finally broke through and she agreed to see my therapist for some marriage counseling. She was angry after our sessions because our therapist kept suggesting that she wasn't respecting my boundaries and had unrealistic expectations of my role as a husband. My wife kept stating that since I saw the same therapist for my individual sessions the therapist had an unfair bias toward my feelings and emotions because she had a negative view of her before she stepped in the room for the first time.

Things improved a little bit for a few years until recently I've been struggling hard with depression. I'm seeing a therapist every week and i feel as if my therapist is leading me down the same path. Which is, i'm not getting what i need from a relationship and that my depression is a symptom of that.

One thing that i'm very bad is is communicating my emotional wants/needs. I'm a people pleaser and have a hard time saying no and pushing my opinion. My therapist and i decided to work on this by telling my wife i need some encouragement the next time i feel depressed to see if that helps.

So the other night i was feeling sad/depressed so i muscled up the courage to ask my wife for a favor, ""Hey, i'm feeling a bit depressed and need a bit of encouragement.""

She responds with, ""No, i'm not giving it to you because you need to learn to live without it.""

Then she proceeds to go to bed with out saying goodnight.

I want to suggest marriage counseling, but i'm half tempted to not even try. I don't think some one deny's their husband a few kind words is someone who's loved and respected.

I'm not 100% sure how to proceed, I want to give her the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to the tragedy but i'm not sure how much longer i can go on without encouragement and constantly walking on egg shells. It wrecks my world.

***To clarify we both live in the US where dating cousins are strongly taboo, but it isn't so in her family's culture/country of origin.

Anyways, she went radio static with me for 2 months saying she was too busy with school and work to stay in regular contact like we always have, so I give her space when she insists she's OK. A few days ago she calls me saying she found out she had a cousin from an uncle that was disowned from the family, and she felt bad so she talked and eventually hung out with her cousin. He soon started acting like he was dating her, and she said she went along with it. And appently he was talking with his ex in the mean time which she was mad about. Anyways he posts that my bestie and him are dating on fb and she confronts him in her car since she had told him she didn't want to go public about them dating and now she wanted to end things. He doesn't want to and starts yelling at her and grabs the steering wheel causing the car to swerve. She was shooken up about it. Anyways when I told her she was lucky she got out of that situation safetly, and that she should stop seeing him period she agreed fully. She lives with her parents and not with him to clarify.

It's been like 2 days later and today she tells me she's in a relationship with him and it's public on fb???? Like even if she can somehow disregard how horribly people look on cousin relationships in the US and how strongly people will judge her, the dude is pure trash and trouble. I even posted warning signs of an abusive person on my timeline yesterday and she liked the post.

Her mom has been in an abusive relationship with her dad for decades, and her sister got back together with her abusive ex. I'm worried she will follow the same path... Especially since she was hung up on a guy who cheated on her 3 times and still went back to him each time (despite me constantly encouraging her and telling her she deserved better) until he chose his baby momma over her and blocked her.

t2_3g330htu,1553795141.0,b6lw01,t3_b6lw01,16," It is with utter sadness And pain that I (25f) write this post. I grew up with a very insecure mom. In my early years, my brother and I were physically abused (there wasn’t too much of it) by my mom until my dad put a stop to it finally. My dad wasn’t around a lot because of the nature of his job. 

I saw my parents fight very often. My mom (55f) would instantly bring up my dads ex girlfriend and fight with him about it. She would nag him and cry to me and my brother all the time about how she doesn’t feel loved. My brother and I pitied her. We were children and because our dad wasn’t around, we would believe that she was innocent, hurt and would blame our dad. My mom would say things like “you’re a pervert. A bastard. Your family is full of shit just like you” to my dad. We thought she was right in standing up for herself because of the hurtful things she’d claimed my dad had done to her. 

Their fights and her constantly bullying my dad didn’t get any better as we grew older. She would throw tantrums but my dad would patiently deal with her. Eventually, my dad lost all of his friends, his family (she fought with all of his sisters and brothers and now no one talks to my dad and mom) and he lost something more important: his children. 

The last time I called my dad, he begged me to call him everyday. I didn’t do that. Somehow we just grew apart. 

As an adult, I grew up to be just like my mom. I m guilty of using manipulative techniques, saying mean and hurtful things, to all my boyfriends in my past relationships. No wonder I’ve been in so many failed relationships! 3 years ago, I finally moved out of my family, got a kick ass job and started living on my own. I realized that I was capable of being a very different woman. I am capable of loving, being compassionate and not using toxic language. 

Therapy has helped me analyze my toxic behaviors and handle them. My boyfriend (27m), god bless his heart, has been extremely supportive of the whole journey. 
 
Last night was the last straw with my mom.  She has a habit of triggering me and my brother with our worst insecurities. She got mad at me for deciding to  sell my car and said “Mike told you to do that? I’ve been with you for so many years and you met this mike 4 months ago and now you’re listening to him? How stupid are you? Mike will leave you sooner than Jason did” 

I don’t know why but I have been crying since 4 am today. Crying about what my therapist told me. That in someways I’m exactly like her. Crying about how she’s made me feel like I’m unworthy of love. How controlling and manipulative she’s been. How she separated me from my father - a man I truly admire. I just feel so lost and helpless. 

Tl;dr: Grew up with an insecure, abusive and crazy mom and it has made me a toxic person. I am weeping with regret, fear and I am helpless. Just needed to vent. Thanks for reading! 

Edit: Mike only suggested I sell my car. He helped me make a budget as I might be moving to a more expensive city. Yes I did listen to him and I am giving up the car. Heck it’s my car. I bought it and if I want to sell it, I can sell it. She got mad because she thought she’d have to ride the bus when she visited me.

t2_b41ow,1553789807.0,b6ks5a,t3_b6ks5a,31,"Last May we moved to a new area for her work, and bought a fixer-upper (her name on paper). It needed a barn for her 3 horses and some serious renovations. So over the summer I built a large barn, and did the majority of the renovating myself while she went to work. That was a long laborious summer. We both share the mortgage/gas payments. I have $15k+ tied up in all the building/renovating.

There is a 30x40 shop that I store my business inventory. Pallet racking, forklift, the whole 9 yards. I also have my 12x32 woodshop moved to the property. I have tens of thousands in assets there is what I’m trying to say.


The issue:

The winter was hard on both of us. We weren't ready for it. I had to snowblow for an hour with the tractor nearly every other day. We’re in real snow country, 3-4ft of it. Always needing to shovel the mailbox out. Anyways, the crux of it is she always has her horses to attend to before work and at night. Now, I normally even help with watering. However, when it comes to the house always I have to take care of it. Practically my part-time job. If the tractor, laundry machine, etc breaks. Snowblowing. Getting Firewood. Doing dishes. Sweeping, any new renovations, etc. Once she’s done with horses and work, she’s already too exhausted to do more (I also care more about cleanliness). House is always a mess if I don't do anything. We communicate decent enough but I’m the one free here during the day, and if something needs to be done or I can’t stand it any longer I do it. She has two cats and I have to deal with them constantly jumping on my desk/laptop. It is effecting my ability to take care of my business and I hate it. We’ve discussed it and it mostly ends up being empty words. I don’t know what to do. I love her but I can’t continue like this. Financially seems like a nightmare. Our plan is to flip this place in a few years, and move south. 

What should I do?

t2_3hyw9fua,1553806418.0,b6o69l,t3_b6o69l,24,"I'm so miserable, depressed, feeling lost &amp; hopeless. Living with my boyfriends family is slowly eating away at my sanity. I can never relax, I have no privacy, I haven't cooked a meal in over a year. I'm tired of hiding away in a 10x12 room. I'm tired of not having a moment of peace or silence. I have to get this off my chest! I'm a list person, so here's a list of all the shit that breaking me down..

I can't take long nor hot showers. His dad complains about the water usage and steam in the bathroom, no matter if the window is open or fan is on. It seems EVERY TIME I take a shower someone has to flush the other toilet, start the dishwasher, start the washing machine, bang on the door to use the bathroom. I've taken to shaving my legs, maybe once a month, or showering long after I'm supposed to be in bed for work the next day, just to get a moment of peace. Not to mention his sister is a PIG. She leaves underwear, socks, clothes on the floor. Toothpaste in the sink, hair and hairbrushes all over the counter. Whatever she uses, she doesn't put away. The garbage is over flowing, and she never replaces the toilet paper. She doesn't mop up the floor after her shower, so I constantly step in puddles and have wet socks. The shower itself is disgusting, used razors, hair in the drain, empty shampoo/conditioner bottles. I have my own shower kit, I lug back and forth because she uses everything of mine. Not ONE item of mine is in the bathroom. I believe I have athlete's foot because of sharing the shower, never had an issue my whole life before this.

I haven't cooked a meal in over a year. Not only am I uncomfortable, I don't feel like cooking for 5 people, its tedious and we don't share the same diet. I'd be cooking meals, I dont enjoy. The kitchen is a disgusting mess. There are dishes piled up on every surface. I'd have to clean the whole kitchen just to cook, then clean it all over again, just for more shit to get piled up again. No one throws anything away. Half eaten plates of food are left out for days. Garbage and wrappers litter the counter, the garbage can is a foot away! They crack hardboiled eggs and leave the shells on the counter. They empty the coffee grounds on the counter. Half eaten fruit and vegetables rot away. If we buy food its eaten within the day. Nothing is off limits. We have to hide non perishable food in our room. They are pigs and gorge on everything until its gone. Doesn't even leave a bite for someone else. 

I do laundry in the middle of the night. Everytime I go to use the washing machine, there's clothes in it. From days ago, smelling like soggy water. So in order to solve that problem, one would put it in the dryer, but that's full also! So on to search for a laundry basket that can't be found. After unloading and loading there clothes, I have no ambition to do my own. It sounds ridiculous, but this is EVERYTIME. But somehow, some fucking how, my laundry gets moved the dryer when there's certain things I don't want dried, are tossed in the dryer. Its like they wait for the buzzer to go off to fuck with me. But can't do thier own laundry! I've argued with his sister over the washer and dryer. She hogs in and takes hours to do loads. Goes off and watches movies, takes a nap, not caring that anyone else needs the washer. Then complains that she's using it. When you dont have school or work or any fucking thing to do the next day! Meanwhile I'm trying to wash a work uniform I have to stretch 3 days of wear out of!

I haven't had a quiet Saturday/Sunday morning in over a year. I like to wake up, brew some coffee and sit and enjoy the silence. No. Impossible. His parents are up early and sit in the living room all day. You have to walk through that room to get anywhere else in the house. Most days I don't want small talk! I don't want to answer ‘goodmorning, how did you sleep?’ like I'm a child! I'm not bubbly in the a.m I don't want to be attacked with questions, suggestions, loud talking, stomping around, vaccuming. They never go anywhere, do anything, always at home. I literally take a deep breath at the end of the hallway and prepare myself going down the hall to deal with them. His mom wants to ‘clean' at the most inconvenient times. At 3 am. At 11pm when we've just laid down for bed. Yes, its a perfect time to vacuum the hall, turn on all the lights, make as much noise as possible. Start 5 cleaning projects, never finish one and have more shit laying around. It's perfectly reasonable to leave the vacuum plugged in for 3 days with the cord laid out in the hallway as a tripping hazard. 

They constantly bother me, constantly want to talk, ask personal questions. For example, his mother is over weight, doesn't eat correctly, asked me the other day ‘Did you eat today?’ ‘Yes' ‘Well what did you eat?’ ‘Breakfast and lunch’ ‘Yeah, but what did you eat exactly?’ It became so awkward and uncomfortable, I snapped. ‘I eat when I'm hungry, I'm very capable of taking care of myself, thank you’ My boyfriend even told her to back off, it was weird and uncomfortable. Her attempts at conversation are invasive and uncomfortable. I try to avoid having conversation with her, it becomes 21 questions with no real dialogue. Which brings me to how little we try to be there. After work we go sit in the car in a parking lot for hours to avoid going home. We arrive after it's dark and hopefully everyone is in bed. We leave early in the morning to avoid everyone as well. The weekends are the only time we're there and even then we make excuses to go out.

Our sex life has suffered greatly. We used to have sex whenever and wherever. Now we're confined to the room, after dark, in silence when hopefully everyone is in bed. I don't feel sexy hearing other people talk about their day or problems in their life in the next room. Not to mention they somehow always want to talk or knock on the door right when its getting heavy. I don't want to feel like a teenager getting away with something, I'm a grown woman who loves sex and wants to be loud, wild and care free. I miss walking around naked, I miss dressing up in sexy outfits and surprising my boyfriend. I miss not having to wear a bra 24hrs a day! 

I fucking hate living here. Their nice people at heart and I'm grateful. I'm saving money but at what cost? I'd rather live in a shack but my OWN shack. Hell, I'd rather live in my car. I cannot wait to move out. And I'm advising ANYONE considering moving into your boyfriend's parents house DO NOT DO IT. Its a living nightmare. I'm SO stressed out, so uncomfortable, so unhappy, I wished I never agreed to this.

I don't actually know when the ‘end date’ is. Boyfriend isn't showing any interest in apartments or houses I've shown him. We have more than enough money to move out. I haven't told him any of the above list, I haven't complained at all. Its a direct attack on his family. And his response would be I could leave on my own if I'm so miserable, but I want to move together, so I'm stuck until he makes up his mind or gets sick of it as well. I'm at my wits ends. So after this long post, my question, is what to do? Leave without him? Gently ask him when? Ultimatum?

I think she is a very strong woman who has been dealt the short end of the stick a lot and done (what she thinks is) the best she could with the circumstances she’s had. Unfortunately, I’ve always been the person to suffer the consequences for the choices she’s made. She couldn’t afford to raise three kids on her own, so she stayed with the father who abused me. My brother had obvious mental health issues since he was young, so she put my needs aside in order to focus on his (imo she failed him too in this regard, but that’s another story). She was having a difficult time in her life with caring for her mother with Alzheimer’s and losing her social support system, so neglected my care when I was recovering from a brain injury and used me to vent all her frustrations. Those are just a few examples, and I can absolutely understand her actions, but it just always sucked to be me growing up. I am also the oldest of my siblings, and have some reason to believe she resents me for “sticking” her with my dad, so she has never been as warm or supportive to me as she is to my siblings, particularly my brother.

I moved out of her house three years ago when I got engaged, and soon afterwards a lot of family drama blew up and I started decreasing contact. My fiancé, who does not like my mother and believes she’s very manipulative, advocated for me to cut contact, but I didn’t want to mostly because of my sister who is 17 and still dependent on my mother. However, six months ago I decided to cut contact after a disastrous visit home that started with everyone “lovingly” making fun of me and taking cracks at my sexual orientation (I’m a lesbian) and ended with my drunk brother screaming at me to “get out of [his] life” and my mom defending him on the grounds that he just quit smoking. I decided I didn’t need that in my life and have had extremely limited contact with my mother since, and only as it pertains to my sister (she also has mental health issues and a budding drug problem so I’ve wanted to stay in the loop about that). 

Now here’s my dilemma: when I told my mother how I would be reducing contact I stressed that it wouldn’t be forever, but I needed some time to heal and be away from her and I couldn’t do that while talking to her. She’s.... honestly varied in how much she’s respected that, but in the last few weeks she’s come to me multiple times offering to talk things out and saying she misses me and wants to be part of my life again. I haven’t yet answered her because I don’t know how. I do love her, and miss her, and I did tell her I wouldn’t cut her off forever, but honestly the longer we don’t talk the happier I am. Since cutting her out I’ve moved across the country, gotten a job I love, started seriously looking at going back to school (after feeling too stupid for school for years due to fights she and I would have), and am just generally happier and more confident than ever before in my life. I’m afraid that inviting her back in will open me up to sliding back into my old, less confident and happy self. I’ve also realized that there were a lot of ways in which she never treated me with respect that I didn’t catch before.

I’m considering telling her that we can talk occasionally only if she follows a set of ground rules, but I don’t know if that’s a good idea or really what those ground rules should be.

Tonight there was a get together for someone who was leaving and two of the people I get along with well went and the others I’ve only spoken to sporadically. I usually sit there and try and listen and take part when I can but sometimes feel awkward when I don’t say anything for a few minutes.

I have social anxiety in general, so mixing with new people is not a strong skill of mine, I’m worried about saying something stupid or saying something I think is funny but don’t incase others don’t laugh or whatever.

Has anyone got any tips on how I can start up conversations, keep conversation going, get involved abit more - they’ve all known eachother for at least a year and I’ve been there for 2 months now so obviously I wont know them completely yet but it’d be nice to not come across as the quiet, awkward one.

t2_3i02adwe,1553820139.0,b6qsnb,t3_b6qsnb,2,"Last week my boyfriend of over a year started playing GTAO after taking a break of a few years. It started as a new thing we were going to do together (he'd move to PC because I just upgraded some of his hardware), and we'd start out from square one. He wanted to check out his PS4 player's stats. Things have become progressively worse since then.

The first few days he complained about griefers and was blown off by his previous crew. Still, I think even the first night he started he put all his off-time into it.

Two days ago I was kindly asked not to play music or podcasts because he had his mic and headset on. I've been going to sleep alone the past few days, and I have trouble falling asleep in silence, so I just tried to play it quietly. A few minutes in he came and turned it off. We live in a studio apartment, so I guess it's fine.

We haven't really been talking. Little texting when we're away from one another.

Yesterday morning, his Saturday, he said he didn't know how this new crew he'd found would react to him being gay, so he asked that I'd be quiet or at least give him warning so he could mute before saying pet names. OK then.

Last night one of them was shouting ""faggot"" loudly enough in my boyfriend's headset that I could hear it. My boyfriend explained that he didn't want to say anything because they still don't know we're gay. We're out to literally everyone we know in the real world, but I guess it's cool to be fake online.

So today I came home. Started talking about my day. Boyfriend was still on the couch, and I literally don't think he moved since we woke up. I got an ""uh-huh"" after he moved his headset back over his ear like you might see in a sitcom.

We haven't done anything together, despite having planned to do things together this week including playing the game together.

I hate to be this kind of person, but here goes. We pay basically the same for our place, but all of the entertainment stuff save the PS4 and his headset were purchased by me while I was working two jobs. My gaming desktop is also plugged into the TV and sound system, and I haven't been able to use any of that stuff for over a week.

I got home around 5:10pm today. Other than the ""uh-huh"" he's asked me if I'd like water. It just feels a lot colder than usual.

I have not wanted to say anything because I felt like I was overreacting, but this is my space and these are my things too. I had also never experienced this guy being such an ass before.

t2_3hzcqwp6,1553813259.0,b6pj7b,t3_b6pj7b,20,"Been dating Larry* for coming up to two years and working on moving into his house (last four months have been house repairs and renovations).

The story:

He was involved in a fender bender and when he pulled out his phone to show me a photo, I noticed he had been texting with a girl I didn’t recognise and asked him. Turned out to be a former neighbour who he still spoke to.

This lead to the question of whether there was anyone else out there he texted a lot. And then he mentioned this girl, who he mentioned as one of his best friends, that he texts daily.

No screaming match or anything so dramatic just me saying these things:
‘At the point in our relationship I felt like I should have been aware of anyone you’re close enough to text with on a daily basis’
‘What would your opinion be if you just found out that I’d been texting with a guy on a daily basis’
His response was more to the fact that ‘he hasn’t seen her in four years’

Day after and I’m just feeling it’s sitting worse with me (as far as I’m aware I’ve heard of other male friends he texts frequently, could have brought her up before - I’m in the middle of studying the subject she studied etc)

So my general question is this, what would your reaction be? I’m looking for perspective on whether I’m making a mountain out of a mole hill or whether I should talk to him and say this has thrown me for a loop but let’s just move past it

I wanted to also tell the story before I gave a little more background.
I’m a divorcee, my marriage broke up because my husband cheated on me, but more do in hindsight spent hours on the phone texting his girlfriend and hiding in the bathroom to do it as well.
I’m also Larry’s first serious long-term girlfriend, so I give him a large benefit of the doubt for being naive.

Not sure how much that impacts the base question of requesting your reaction but I will freely admit I am sensitive to phone use and have been upfront with Larry day one that trust is my biggest issue.

TL;DR: dating two years, just found out about boyfriends female best friend, he texts daily with, requesting feedback because not sure if my worsening feeling about the situation is warranted.

I have made myself an LED lit (edgelit) picture frame with pillars of creation. It has a dimmer controller, so I can make it just subtly glow, or light up pretty well, stronger than regular night-lights.

I am trying to figure out two problems. First one is the light bleed around the edges, you can sort of see it in the picture, I am not sure how to evenly diffuse it, making it backlit vs. edge-lit is not an option unless I make the frame thicker, its 1.5"" already. Second issue is the washed out colors, which are not that bad on lower levels, but I get bothered when I crank up the brightness.

I have ordered another poster on thicker full gloss paper hoping it will reduce the washed out colors. I have also put a slight vignetting on it to reduce the edge bleed. We will see how that works in few days.

How its build: 20"" x 16"" x 1.5"" frame for IKEA. Clear acrylic sheet, poster, several filters and diffusers from TV panels, 1/8"" thick plastic sheet also from TV, LEDs around the edges and back plate with reflective white sheet at the end. One note, the LEDs are not shining directly on the edge of the 1/8"" sheet, they are above it. I had to cut it to size making 2 edges murky, they don't pass on too much light making light distribution uneven.

Any thoughts on improvements would be appreciated.",DIY,"Made myself a LED-backlight picture frame, looking for some advice on making it better"

My house was built in 1918 and the porch is due for some repair.

I ripped out an area of flooring and a railing on the back of my porch. The floor boards were rotted and the column also rotted where they attached the railing.

Me and my boyfriend are both virgins but we are not religious and do not plan on waiting until marriage to have sex.

From the start, we were pretty physical with each other. We did light sexual stuff at first and it slowly escalated throughout our relationship. To preface this, he was never really comfortable with me pleasuring him. To this day, I’ve never giving him a handjob, blowjob, nothing. Whenever I have tried to, he always ends up telling me to stop. He says he might be too sensitive ‘down there’.  He is also a bit insecure down there (even though it is perfect (above average size))

So almost two years into our relationship was the first time I initiated having sex (it shocks me too). We were at my house and, surprisingly, no one was home. (And when you’re at this age, it’s pretty rare when you have the entire house to yourself with no parents or siblings around) We were doing some sexual stuff but after nothing escalating after awhile, I asked him if he wanted to “do it”. He asked me if I thought we were ready to have sex. I said yes and he even agreed! But he told me another time would be a better time (for whatever reason).

Since then, there has been SEVERAL PERFECT opportunities to have sex for the first time. I have always been the one to initiate the sex. Every single time he would turn me down and give an excuse like it’s not a good time or that he was nervous, etc.

Ever since we started college, we have had significantly more freedom and trust with our families and we have the house to ourselves much more frequently. The closest we’ve been to sex was on our 3rd anniversary. We showered together then went into his room. We were doing sexual stuff and then he got up and asked if he should get a condom. Excitedly, I was like heck yeah. But obviously, like most virgin couples, there was condom struggles so we surrendered. I wasn’t as upset because at least he initiated it this time. 

Whenever we have an opportunity to have sex now, I don’t even want to ask. I figured if he really wanted to have sex, he would initiate it. But every time we have a chance to have sex, he never initiates it. It’s been four months since that occurrence and we have had plenty of opportunities. 

I have confronted him many times about this issue. When I confront him he says he genuinely wants to have sex with me, but he feels weird/nervous when it comes down to it... But we know everything about each other, we are very familiar with each other’s bodies, we are sexually intimate(disregarding intercourse), we are so close... Why doesn’t he feel comfortable? I know he takes sex very seriously, but so do I. I think maybe he is hyping sex up too much. I guess he is insecure and is “sensitive”. But I mean, he is able to masturbate just fine from what he tells me. He says he wants to have sex with me but it does not seem that way. There are specific times and days when there is no one at his house besides himself for a prolonged amount of time. Why won’t he just ask me to come over then? I know he doesn’t want it to feel “forced” but I mean he has to take some sort of initiative for it to happen! This issue harbors a lot of resentment on my part. I feel rejected, unwanted, undesirable, and most of all, frustrated. What do I do? I’ve confronted him so many times and nothing has changed.... at this point it makes me feel kind of pathetic. I feel like I’m begging him to have sex with me. I am honestly just SO fed up at this point. I mean shouldn’t he want to have sex with me?! Not to mention, I am the one that always carries around the condoms (and he knows I always have them just in case)

And something else—ever since we tried to have sex that one time. He complained about the condoms and asked why wouldn’t I just take birth control. I had my reasons not to but I recently developed ovarian cysts so now I have to take birth control. I’ve been on the birth control for about two months now. I mean doesn’t that excite him? Shouldn’t he be even more inclined to have sex now that he won’t have to worry about condoms?! But still absolutely no initiative! I just wish he would care enough to initiate and plan a time for us to have sex. I feel like I’ve done everything to make him feel comfortable enough to have sex with me. 

What can I do to resolve this issue? Why doesn’t he initiate sex if he “wants to have sex”? Is the absence of sex something worth breaking up over? Am I being insensitive? Should I try to be more understanding/patient?

It’s honestly very frustrating to me because I’m young, I have a high libido, I’m in good shape and I have great ideas for interesting things we can do in bed. We have a good, healthy, long-term relationship, we’ve been together for so long... I want us to have sex not just to experience the sex itself but to share this step in our relationship, to experience something amazing together. I just feel SO frustrated over this. Any advice would be appreciated. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have not ever had sex after being together for 3.5 years. He says he wants to have sex with me but I guess lacks the desire to imitate it? I have communicated this to him but nothing has changed.

She has always been financially unstable because my dead beat dad didnt pay child support. They divorced when I was 8. She is an amazing and strong woman, who raised 2 daughters on her own after immigrating to Canada from Korea. I started working when I was 16 and since then I always gave her money to support her because that was the right thing to do. She worked very hard, sometimes 3-4 jobs to make ends meet. I worked 3 jobs throughout my bachelors (nursing) and also always paid her (up to $1000/month). When I started working full time as a registered nurse I gave her $1500/month. I always thought this was the right thing to do. She would never reject the money and would get mad if I came up short. I know she was always terrified of not paying rent and sometimes had night terrors. This was due to my dad never working and earning money and supplying her with any income. She told me that I am filling in the space where my dad shouldve been and thats why giving her money makes sense. It made sense to me at the time and all I wanted to do was help her. She bought a house with my step dad but he passed away a year later. Since then she made me promise her I will live with her and support her financially until I get married. If I want my family can live with her forever, and I would financially support her forever. I agreed at first, it was such a good idea. Then I met my bf and all of a sudden I wanted to move out and live in the city. I even got a full time job in the city. All of a sudden I didnt want to live in the suburbs anymore. I felt like I was stuck. I started rebelling, getting angry, asking her why do I have the burden of taking care of her financially. I fought and argued with my mom constantly. She always threatened to sell the house and she will just go live in an apartment but it would all be my fault. I know she can only make minimum wage in Canada she but was an accountant in Korea. I know she hates being in this situation and has no other choice... Eventually she found a retired man with a good pension that moved in with her. He is financially supporting her now. But I know she doesnt really love him and she had to find someone because of me. She said I can move out now but she will never trust me financially again. I feel really guilty and I feel like I failed her in a way. If I stayed with her she wouldnt need to be with this man. This man is kind of arrogant and doesnt really like me either. But this is the situation now...and she is going to help me buy a condo next year and Ill move out. But I feel that she would have wanted me to live with her until I moved out...and that I wouldve financially supported her. She also gets really lonely and wanted me to live with her even when I got married. I just feel so bad. I feel so selfish for having all these wants and following through. I still give her 30% of my income for the mortgage and always will to support her. But I no longer want to live with her forever. I feel like one day when she passes away I will always feel guilty. How do I get over this guilt?

I understand that my boyfriend's very close with his mom. He's an only child, and she's a single parent. His dad lives abroad and they see each other perhaps twice a year.

The way my boyfriend and his mom talk to each other resembles a friendship more than a parent-child relationship. Actually, sometimes they sound like roommates. It was a little weird to get used to in the beginning, but ultimately, it's none of my business.

With that said, is it wrong to disapprove of my boyfriend talking to his mom about our sex life? He's so used to doing this that he doesn't even second-guess why I might be bothered.

His mom doesn't hold back in front of me, either. The last time boyfriend had me over for dinner, his ex came up in a conversation and boyfriend's mom made an explicit comment comparing my penis size to his ex-boyfriend's and proceeded to explain why that matters.

On the one hand, I get that they were making a deprecating joke about the ex. On the other hand, what the hell? I'm sure I'm not the only person who'd find that type of a conversation with SO's parent inappropriate. Not even getting into the fact that she knows our sizes.

I brought this up with my boyfriend the other day. He was surprised that the conversation bothered me, but promised to tone it down. He always does though. I'm afraid he's oblivious to just how weird that stuff is because these incidents keep happening. Before, we had an argument over his mom texting me articles on relationships and sex relevant to our problems.

Am I honestly asking for too much? How can I make my boyfriend draw the line?

t2_17bhty,1553819780.0,b6qqce,t3_b6qqce,23,"So back story on the cats. 

I have a plump tabby that i adopted when i was 19. She is 14, and very sweet. She has lived with a number of other cats in our 12 years together, and always done just fine with them. Not always the best of friends, but was never violent. Maybe a few hisses here and there with cats that are too rowdy or get in her space.

A year ago, before we were engaged, my fiancé adopted a 3 month old female kitten. His son really wanted one, and he saw how great my cat was, so he was sold. We lived separately at that time.

The kitten was, and still is, sweet most of the time. She is energetic and up in everything, but that's part of having a cat. She loves to play, and is very purry and friendly to me, my fiancé and his son. She would have her scary moments where she would play aggressively and scratch and bite, but those moments were playful, not malicious.

Now we have all moved in together. The two cats can't be in the same room, because when they are, his cat attacks my cat so violently that it's terrifying. If you attempt to pull her off, she will attack you, scratching, biting and yowling. My cat basically lives in our very large bedroom with food, water and a litter box in the bathroom for her. His cat mostly stays in the living room or his sons room. 

This arrangement is super annoying- his cat is constantly trying to get into our room to murder my cat. We have to keep a door closed at all times. His cat also recently attacked me so violently for no reason. I woke up on a Saturday morning and had a cuddle with my girl. I got up to make coffee and saw his cat sleeping on his sons bed, so i went over and gave her some purrs and kisses. She was happy and loving, until she just sort of snapped and started biting and scratching me. I tried to get up and she went after my bare legs. His son came in to help me and she hissed at him.

I know you aren't supposed to re home animals, and i would feel awful doing It, but this isn't fair to me or my cat. I don't like seeing all of us covered in scratches and cuts from her reigns of terror, or from grabbing her before she can lunge in and attack my cat. I want to have a baby in the next 2-3 years, and i would 100% not feel comfortable having this cat anywhere near a baby. 

My fiancé and his son love their cat, and don't want to give her away. They want to give It more time for the cats to get along. We have tried all the methods of introducing them slowly, we have tried feliway, pills to sedate his cat, nothing is working. I am not going to put my 14 year old cat through a potential attack every day, so there is no way I'm letting them just fight It out amongst themselves.

t2_3hub3j8h,1553758360.0,b6fu8x,t3_b6fu8x,29,"Hi everyone

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - Worried about breaking up with anxious/depressive girlfriend over fear of her mental health deterioirating.

&amp;#x200B;

Throwaway account as per usual, I \[23M\] wanted to ask a question that has been playing on my mind for a while: How do you break up with your girlfriend \[22F\] who is VERY emotional?

&amp;#x200B;

**A little bit of context:** We've been officially dating for a little over a year and vibing for two. She is the absolute best to hang out with, we have so much fun and the banter is always flowing!  We have a lot of interests in common and get along really well on the 'best-friend' side of the relationship, however, when it comes down to the real stuff, I've found she always falls short. She doesn't pick up on my distress regarding a lot of personal issues I have in my life and doesn't know how to sit someone down and actually *TALK* to people about what might be wrong and try to help. Now I'm an 'emotional' person too, I'm very self- and socially-aware but recently I've been feeling incredibly depressed about where my life is going as every millenial does when they're in their early 20s, another contributing factor to my depression is the lack of support or lack of people in my life who are able to provide emotional support. I don't really have many close friends I can talk to (hence the Reddit post...), my best friend is a bit of a fully functional psychopath - he doesn't even know what emotions are let alone trying to understand and put himself in other peoples shoes. I don't have anyone to talk to, only my psychologist which, well, they can't really insert themselves into your lives so that doesn't help either, he just helped me realise that this relationship is a bit toxic and detrimental and one of the main causes of my depression.

&amp;#x200B;

The other day I tried to talk to my girlfriend about how I was doing, I was having a REALLY shit day, so I tried to just have a simple, constructive conversation with her in the hope that it might make me feel better but it actually made things worse. I could see her reaction was annoyance and frustration when I brought up the reasons I was feeling down, and got the sense that she didn't want to talk about the problems I was having and basically told me to 'just get over it and move on'. Not something you really want to hear from the only person you have that can offer you support. - this by the way, is not the first time, I don't bother talking to her about my smaller problems because she just turns it around to try and snap me out of it so that I can focus on giving her love and attention.

&amp;#x200B;

**Regarding the overly emotional stuff:** She has the shortest fuse in the world. She takes meds everyday, and too suffers from heavy anxiety and depression, she will wake up and feel axious about everything and not want to go to college or will be too scared to go out, she'll refuse to make decisions on stupid things like what movie to watch or what type of dinner she'd prefer, she never gives me her opinion - the answer is always ""Whatever, I don't mind"" or "" I'm easy, whatever you want"" and when I ask her opinion on something, the top response I get is ""Meh, I'm indifferent"". You can't have a conversation with someone who is CONSTANTLY on the fence about everything. I've always been there to support her through everything in her life, I'll suck it up because if I get annoyed that she's not giving me any help or idea then the tears start flowing (like, I don't want you to tell me EXACTLY what you want, give me an idea so I know which path to follow!), I've been her rock for our whole relationship but she hasn't been mine, she constantly demands love and attention and CONSTANT REASSURANCE that everything is fine in our relationship, but as soon as I want to talk to her about an issue in our relationship it's like the whole world is coming down. Tears! And I can't talk to someone who's emotions are hightened like that, there's no way to have a constructive conversation about what is actually wrong.

Her mental state is what I'm most worried about. Because she has depression and anxiety, I fear she might in fact hurt herself or it might actually destroy her to the point that she can't get out of it. It's not really fair that I can't live my life to it's fullest potential with no shackles without the feeling of guilt that I seriously hurt someone for my own personal gain but I'm at my wits end. It's not a healthy relationship, I know she's holding me back and I know I'll be able to slowly recover from my depression when I have the freedom to do whatever I want and not have to thinkabout anyone else.

She doesn’t have a lot of friends. She’s from a different country and her personality can come off as abrasive to Americans, so she hangs out with other Eastern Europeans. She used to have more friends when I was very young and they fell out of touch, but she got back in touch with them a year or so ago so she sees them every month or so. She has some online friends she talks to, too. She calls her sister and mom a lot who live in another country but they all just yell at each other on the phone. 

My dad isn’t very social either, but he does a lot of things on his own and has hobbies that keep him busy. My parents will watch tv together every night and hang out on weekends, but sometimes my dad gets really busy and has to work on the weekend.

I live at home, but will probably be moving out soon. Because I want to feel like an adult and not live in this weird in between stage forever. I feel a lot of pressure to hang out with her and spend time with her, but it’s hard because I work long hours and obviously I want to spend time with my friends too. And when we spend time together she just criticizes me, tells me to eat more/less, wear makeup, wear less makeup, go to the gym, work out less, etc etc. so it’s not very fun for me.

I feel extremely guilty that I don’t like hanging out with her. I try and spend time with my parents and do stuff with them but I also want to grow into my own, because I feel like I’m not progressing with my life living at home. But then I would feel guilty moving out.

My mom will say she’s so sad and stuff and I’ve told her to go to therapy, or start a hobby, or anything and she refuses. She goes to a fancy gym every day and she gets enjoyment from that but she doesn’t have any other hobbies except worrying about me and stuff. I feel bad she doesn’t have a lot of social interaction but she won’t take any of my suggestions.

She also will exaggerate and say things like we’re poor and don’t have money, and that she’s going to die soon so I should listen to her lecture me and stuff like that. I think I am overly sensitive but when she says stuff like that I just feel like crap and want to cry because I’m sad her life isn’t as exciting as it could be. And I feel guilty that we’re poor or something. My mom says stuff like that and then goes to a $200/month gym and gets her hair done at the salon and whatnot, so I know she’s just saying that stuff to make me feel guilty. I do live at home and don’t pay rent but other than that I pay for myself. If it were really an issue I could definitely contribute money so I think she just wants me to feel bad. She knows what to say to make me feel guilty. She will also text me saying that *I* don’t love her or I hate her and things like that, putting words in my mouth per se.

I want her to be happy but I don’t know how to help her. I don’t want her to feel bad but I don’t want to feel super depressed all the time because of this. 

I have gone to therapy myself and talked about my relationship with her but even when I try and take the high road and do what I can she will text me constantly throughout the day how crappy her life is. I wish I could like force her to get a hobby, because obviously I can’t be with her when I’m working.

t2_2niu6kj7,1553719218.0,b69fsi,t3_b69fsi,125,"So I have been very close friends with my friend Alex \[25m\] for several years now.

He's cheated on pretty much every one of his girlfriends and is currently with a girl that he cheated on his ex with. He hasn't cheated recently, although he REGULARLY tells me how hot other girls are/how tempting they are etc.

I knew about it all. I wouldn't say I approved but I just kind of... accepted it as part of his character. He was a very caring, loving friend to me otherwise and I valued his time.

I have just gotten out of an abusive relationship where I was cheated on. I went to therapy and I think I'm wising up

So I challenged Alex on his cheating. We rarely talk serious or fight and honestly, I probably shouldn't have done it because ultimately its none of my business as I'm not his girlfriend.

He told me that the reason he's cheated is because

a) he finds the girl way hotter/sexier/has a crush on them

b) he's dissatisfied with his current relationship

&amp;#x200B;

Um??

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I obviously don't understand it. He's essentially saying 'I cheated because my girlfriend wasn't good/hot enough' and I just feel like that is shitty and lacks any insight or introspection.

So I called him out, and tried to get him to well, see his OWN behaviour in the whole thing.

That went down like a lead balloon. It went something like this,

""I told you that it was because I found X hotter, and I wasn't happy with Y. I answered your question.""

""But then you could have ended the relationship. I just don't think you're actually thinking about WHY you thought it was okay to do what you did.""

""This is how long term relationships work, jasminesmerelda. You decide if the relationship is strong enough. I know cheating was the wrong decision but I told you why I did it.""

""I don't understand how this is to do with the girl or the relationship. Surely it's to do with the cheater. Why wouldn't you end it?""

""Well, the other person might reject you then you'd be happy that you didn't break up.  If you're a dick. But I told you I did it because I really fancied X and wasn't happy with Y. What do you want me to say?""

""Wow. Something about yourself and your own actions?  So then it's to do with the cheater, isn't it?""

""I told you why I did it. You're just not wanting to accept the answer because it makes you unhappy.  What do you want me to say?""

""I just can't understand how you can't see your own intentions in the cheating.""

""You're making me feel like shit and I already feel shit about it. That's not fair. Let's stop talking.""

&amp;#x200B;

I apologised, but he's not talking to me currently. Was I in the wrong to call him out on this?

I guess maybe it just hurt to hear that 'reasoning' having just been cheated on myself, so maybe that's why I wasn't backing down. It just seems to me that he lacks any kind of self reflection that it was a shitty thing to do. He knows it was wrong but he still acts like it's because the girl wasn't good enough. In my opinion it's because the CHEATER is a shitty person.

Looking back, I wanted him to see that but perhaps I went about it wrong. I've apologised though so there's not much else I can do. Is he right in this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*tldr\*\* My close friend has a history of cheating. I called him out on it after years and I think I came across as not wanting to listen and trying to make him 'see' what he did was wrong. Am I a terrible friend?

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT --** 

Wow, I did not expect the overwhelming response to this question. Thank you all SO MUCH for your time and analysis.

This has made me think. I think a big part of it was definitely my hurt from what has happened to me recently, and maybe hoping to get an answer that would rationalise what happened to me or something. Of course, it didn't. At the same time, therapy and generally looking at things from a different perspective is what made me tackle this.

BUT.... more importantly, and overwhelmingly.... he's a dick. And I haven't really processed it well enough before. I know it seems obvious, and thats my bad. But this has just helped me see it on a different level.

We still aren't talking and I haven't reached out. Honestly, I'm re-evaluating things and our entire friendship at this point. I can see where I went wrong in this conversation, but the problem at hand is likely a bigger one and his attitudes will continue to hurt. I feel a lot more comfortable in making the decision to step back from the friendship, at least for now based on all this.

t2_38tgg6ls,1553822049.0,b6r4b7,t3_b6r4b7,1,"
I began seeing my fwb back in April of last year (next Monday will actually be one year since we've met) and he was in a relationship at that time. When we first met I was not looking for any romantic relationship of any kind and he said that I wasn't the kind of person he'd be romantically interested in. His partner at the time had no issues with our arrangement. We actually followed through on the ""friends"" part of the fwb arrangement. We are very close and when I was abroad for a few months, called, vchatted, and sexted around once a fortnight. There were some issues at first - he is the sweetest person I've ever met but can be a bit boneheaded and he said some things that hurt me deeply, but I expressed my feelings to him and we worked it out. I also wanted to make sure that we kept boundaries, and asked that we not use pet names or terms of endearment. He is naturally a very affectionate person and calls me pet names, and I take responsibility for the fact that, after a few months of knowing each other, I stopped enforcing those boundaries.

His partner and him had some difficulties and ended up breaking up at the beginning of the year. Around that time he began seeing two other partners and would do things such as accidentally compare their sexual performances to mine, and also seemed disinterested in spending time with me. Since we were very good friends I was very upset and made the foolish choice of not speaking to him about it because he was going through the middle of a breakup and an important professional training/milestone and I thought I should handle my feelings on my own so that I do not get in the way of an important part of his life. He was obviously infatuated with one of his new partners and did not initiate meetups as often. He did not seem to care about professional or personal milestones in my life and rather used me as a therapist, having me work through the feelings he had for people he thought of more and wanted to spend more time with. I don't think he did this maliciously but there were times when I would ask for him to initiate meetups more and he would apologize, saying that he was busy and that maybe I should initiate less, so that he would feel my absence and come to me more.

He stopped seeing his partners as often around the middle of February. I didn't actually know this as I had asked not to hear about his sex life, as I felt uncomfortable hearing about sex with other people as I didn't know whether his other partners would be ok with him discussing it with me.

Things kind of came to a head when he missed a very important performance I had invited him to. I was absolutely infuriated as this had been something I had been working on for weeks. I knew that he had been more conscientious with his other partners, especially the one he had romantic interest in, and felt used. I spoke to him about how I felt disrespected and that he had little interest in me besides using me as a comfort blanket and a therapist. He was very upset that I had not communicated this back in January. I understand that this is my mistake but to give some context - he was under a high degree of pressure and stress and honestly I felt that having difficult conversations with him at the time would have been bad for him. He explained that I should have at least asked if he would be willing to have difficult conversations with him during that time. I agree now that that would have been the best course of action. In any case, I would have had that conversation with him anyways, but the circumstances of him missing my event made it a situation in which two months of resentment and pain boiled over. It wasn't good.

Around that time I realized I had feelings for him (haha whoops) and decided to tell him because I figured that we should end our arrangement since he so vehemently declared that I could never be an object of romantic interest. I figured it would be healthier for me to stop seeing him and move on.

Well, it turns out he has feelings for me too. I think. That's what he said at least. We both agreed that we shouldn't date right now while we work this out, and he told me that while he would be on dating apps, he wasn't looking for a relationship at the time while he worked on himself. He is very ashamed of his insensitive tendencies, and honestly, I was incredibly upset at him and told him that he was a bad person to me. There were times in January where I would try to communicate my upset, and he would say things such as (paraphrased) ""Oh it's ok, it's not like I don't have time to see all of my partners so I'll keep seeing you"" (implying that if time was a factor, I would be dropped as a fwb).

We are talking about things and we have had difficult conversations in the past couple of days over the pain I felt about feeling rejected and his guilt over causing me pain. He is going on tinder dates, and told me that he might want to start a relationship with one of them. When I asked him where he viewed me as part of his life, he told me that he didn't feel comfortable dating me right now because he still felt guilty over causing me pain. His previous partner also was often hurt by him and he still is very ashamed of how he made her feel. He says that he knows that there are people out there that are less sensitive and that will not be hurt by his words or actions as easily, and that will communicate with him when they are upset (this point really upset me, since the incident at the beginning of the year was the only time I didn't communicate with him when he was behaving hurtfully for what I thought at the time were justified reasons). He says that while he does have feelings for me, he wants to get into other relationships first and see if he is able to think about dating me a few months down the line.

I don't think I can do that. I do have feelings for him and to see him develop a relationship with another person while I am stuck in a limbo of will he/won't he date me will be unhealthy for me. For this reason, I am thinking of ending this year long arrangement. The thought does not excite me at all. I am literally in tears typing this but I don't fucking know what to do.

I would appreciate any feedback this sub has to give. I have made a lot of mistakes the past two months and I want to be told honestly if the disintegration of this relationship is my fault. Thank you for reading.

I’m currently in graduate school. Last summer, I had an internship that lead to a job offer for after I graduate, starting this fall (standard in my industry). It’s also a fairly social but insular industry- you tend to work long hours and hang out with your coworkers quite a bit.

During my internship, I worked under a guy who was right around my age that I thought was super cute in a nerdy way. I had a crush on him, but I don’t think he had any idea- only one friend there guessed it and she’s super perceptive. I know he at least enjoyed *working* with me, and we spent some time talking outside of work at the social events our company put on that was fun. Sometimes it seemed like he was a little nervous around me (I’m not a stunner, but I’m cute enough, I think, and have made some guys who were into me nervous before), but he also had a sort of neurotic personality. After my internship, he added me and a 2 others from my internship class on LinkedIn. We never exchanged personal contact info, as we had been issued cell phones for work, and that’s how I could reach him if I needed to. Because I was trying to be professional, I also didn’t add anyone who wasn’t a fellow intern on social media or anything.

He was single over the summer, but I was really just trying to secure my job at the time. I had figured that, if anything were to happen between us, it definitely wouldn’t be when I was an intern- but something maybe could once I was working there and likely in a different division than he was.

About 2 weeks ago, I saw on LinkedIn that he had moved to another company earlier this year. I sent him a message on LinkedIn saying that I was sad he wouldn’t be at the company as I enjoyed working with him, but hoped it was a good move for him. He responded and said thanks, and that his office wasn’t too far so he’d come say hi. I kind of forgot to respond after that (whoops- grad school’s been busy).

**Now that he’s not working at the same company as me, should I just ask him out? Is it super weird to do it over LinkedIn since I don’t have any other contact info for him?**

I’ve asked guys out as a woman before- I really have no problem doing that or accepting rejection. He’s cute, but I’m not going to die or obsess over him if he’s not interested.

However, the only way I have to reach him now is through LinkedIn, which feels less than ideal... like I feel like this is a staple creepy dude move, so if I did it, I’d want to be very careful and precise with how I worded it, especially since I don’t even know if he’s still single.

Alternatively, he is still friends with a number people at the company I’ll be joining in the fall, so I may see him around with some of them and could possibly suss it out then... What are your thoughts?",relationships,Should I (late 20s F) ask a former coworker (late 20s M) out over LinkedIn?

I've known my partner K. for 6 years. We met while I was a student and developed something of a sugar baby-daddy relationship. The term makes me cringe, but I guess it's accurate. He'd buy me expensive things and dinners and we traveled together. We weren't sexually or emotionally exclusive back then. I don't want to get all explicit, but let's just say we had our fun.

The idea of being together didn't come up until about 3 years later. K. got a promotion, which also meant moving abroad for awhile. At first, K. asked me to come with him, which I couldn't do because of my studies. We did realize we shared a connection beyond sexual chemistry, though. We decided to pursue a long-distance relationship of sorts. Neither of us expects sexual exclusivity from each other, but we have a strong emotional partnership.

Due to his job abroad, I can only see K. once every few months. We haven't discussed meeting family (our friends know about us, though). In part because of the distance and in part because of the nature of our relationship. We don't have long-term expectations because it seems impractical at the moment, and we don't like being tied down anyway.

The issue is my mom found out about K. through conversations with my sister. She's always asking me whether I have a partner, and now she insists on meeting K. and keeps questioning me about him. K. says he doesn't mind meeting my mom when he's in town, though I feel kind of weird about the whole deal. But perhaps I'm just not used to such things?

Do you think we should go through with this? If so, what should be our approach? I'm not sure how to respond to my mom's questions about the way K. and I met, the length of our relationship, the idea of marriage etc. She's already curious about all of this, by the way.

Backstory; we’ve been together for 6ish months. Everything is mostly great too! We want a lot of the same goals, future, etc. And we get along super well like 80% of the time. So here’s the issue and where I feel things are toxic. 

I’ve always been very open and free and confident, other than struggling with anxiety/depression (I’m working on it, finally off medication yay!) but for the most part I’m very independent and I’ve always seen being in a relationship as a partnership, not as needing to being super codependent. 

My boyfriend is great, except he’s very jealous. He knows this and is working on it, but at the same time I can tell he feels very justified in some of his somewhat controlling actions. Things he does/says that bothers me is he basically always asks about who I’m talking to and whether I’ve had a romantic history with them if they’re a man. One time I sent a friend of mine (guy) a heart on twitter as a reply to something and he basically lost it and said it was disrespectful. We worked it out and I basically told him to lay off and understand that sending a heart via the internet isn’t a big deal. 

Secondly he has the idea in his head that he always comes second after my friends. Not true, and no matter what I do or say he won’t accept it. My two closest friends are nothing but supportive of everything I do and have helped me through a lot of shit in the 7+ years we’ve been friends, so obviously they hold value to me. Yet every time he has a few drinks or a specific incident happens he gets upset and basically says that I don’t love him as much as he loves me. Bullshit, but it’s frustrating. 

And then there’s the little things that he does that honestly make me feel a bit like he’s policing me/my body. He’ll make offhanded comments about “oh I wish you were wearing a bra, but you look good” when we went out to celebrate our birthdays. I was wearing a tight fitting bodysuit and a bra just makes things more uncomfortable. Keep in mind when we met I had my nipples pierced so going bra-less wasn’t a rare occurrence for me. He also makes these sort of comments about me being slutty. Not directly but will make jokes about how many men I’ve slept with or that I’m cheating with some douchbag blah blah. But when I confront him and say hey, that bothers me, he’s like “oh come on, it’s a joke, it’s not meant to hurt you” 

So bottom line, yeah I know there’s some messed up shit that he’s doing, but on the other hand he’s always the first to apologize and admit when he’s wrong. He’s been so incredibly supportive of my struggle with depression/anxiety and he’s always there for me when I need him. 

I guess the overarching question is one of, if anyone has any personal experiences in these types of situations is there anything I can do to make things better? Can these issues be fixed? Or am I doomed and should just give up on the relationship? 

Thanks pals!

I’ve been through a few phases with my sexuality and gender. At first, as we all do, I identified as a straight cis male. As time went on, I realized I wasn’t straight, and  began to identify as bisexual. That never really fit right, and as I began to question that, I also began to question my gender. I never really fully felt male, but I also never felt fully female, so I identified as non-binary for a while. That didn’t quite feel right either, but I recently found a home in identifying with both sexes, as being bigender. It’s the only label that’s ever fit. After realizing that, I started identifying as fully gay, which also felt like a much better fit. This is where things get confusing.

I never felt that I experienced heterosexual attraction, through talking with other (gay) women and some with men about how they experience love with another woman, I felt that I experienced love and affection with women in a way much more similar to how they did than cis men did with women, which further solidified myself as being gay. It works something like this: as someone who identifies as bigender, all love I experience is gay. My “womanly” half (an extreme oversimplification, but bear with me) is attracted to women and my “manly” half is attracted to men.

I’ve only ever dated women, but it’s always been rocky. My first relationship with a woman was deeply abusive. After that I carried on dating two women at once for almost 2 years, and was off and on emotionally with a 3rd (female) partner for a few months throughout that as well. Yeah, I know. It was messy. Flash forward a couple of years and every relationship I’ve had with a woman has been pretty tragic. Broken hearts abound. I hate it. I promised myself I’d never hurt anyone that way ever again. 

Just before my most recent partner moved in, I decided I was going to give being fully gay (mlm) a go. I was feeling good about it but when my roommate, then a platonic friend, moved in, (we’ll call her Sarah), things changed. I think she’d had a crush on me for a while and insisted on sleeping with me in my bed bc we didn’t have a mattress for her yet as she moved in under emergency circumstances. Well, as things tend to go, we began to get involved physically.

She’s very aggressive sexually and it bothers me. I began to question if I’ve ever really enjoyed having sex with a woman and what exactly my deal is because I found myself pretty thoroughly unenthused at the prospect of having sex with her. I do get aroused by her touch and enjoy oral sex and touching but anything beyond that, frankly, grosses me out a bit. As a contextualizer, I wasn’t particularly attracted to her to begin with, but as we became more emotionally involved physical attraction somewhat developed. 

I was kind of just pushing through, but last week, something particularly concerning happened. She was going down on me (despite me pushing her away a few times) and I almost completely dissociated while it was happening. I stayed hard and even finished (one of the few times I have since we’ve been involved), but I don’t think it’s normal to abandon the moment mentally in order to “get through” receiving oral sex. 

Now I’m questioning it all. I enjoy women and women’s bodies. But feel grossed out at times by the idea of having sex with them or being intimate with a romantic partner of the “opposite” sex (I almost never have issues during casual hookups). 

What do I do? I don’t want to hurt her feelings, but I’m really feeling like women aren’t right for me. There’s just been so much difficulty for me romantically and sexually when dating women that I’m considering swearing them off forever...again. What do I do? I don’t want to hurt another person.

Tl;dr: I think I’m gay, but I enjoy women (for the most part), what could this mean?

t2_1r3ut6xq,1553810222.0,b6oxmb,t3_b6oxmb,8,"
Let me start this by saying that it (was) my first serious relationship but not my first love. I had my heart broken 3 times before that because of unjustified break ups and being cheated on. Dont know if its relevant to the story but there you go. I say that because i know how it feels to be broken up with when you think everythings going great. Not a great feeling at all and i think i just did the same to her with this situation. 

A bit about my personality :
I'm kinda reserved in general, i dont like going out to bars/clubs or parties. I just dont like loud ambiance and being constantly surrounded by people i dont know. Point is, i like hanging our with small groups of friend or just one person at a time. I have few interests in life but those i have, i'm very pationate about. I would think as being somewhat funny, im kinda eorried about saying that i'm smart because generally people who think they are turn out to be the opposite but i do know i'm a very logic person. But above anything else, i'm a very caring person. It might also be my buggest flaw since its what lead to my relationship going down the drain. I will always make the need of other go before my own and this is ever since i was young. I cant stand seeing people around me not happy or un need and so i will make everything in my power to make them happy even if it makes me unhappy. Such was the with my gf (ex gf).

A little bit about her:
She, like me, is a very shy person and likes to stay indoors or do things with a small groul of people or just 1 person. We have alot of interest in common and she's pationate about her interest as much as i am to mine. She's funny, loving and most of all very loyal to our relationship. Thing is, she has a very big anxiety problem coupled with trust issues and self esteem issues. Not the greatest mix but could be worst. She's very happy when we are together but very unhappy and stressed out when we arent. (We live 2 hours appart so we see each other maybe once or twice a month for 3 days straight ). She has alot of trouble with controlling her emotions and is sometime very mean and impulsive with the way she talks to me and about us. But says thats i mean the world to her and i'm the best things thats ever happened to her.

So, that being said, i got fed up with it and decided to leave her.

The relationship was always 100 or 0. It always went perfectly or it was the worst. More often than not it was going great but for the times that it wasnt, it was unbearable. Every fight was the same. I would somehow make her upset ( sometimes for the smallest reasons like playing video games together and she would be displeased ) and then it would be a non-stop argument where she would be mad for the most insignificant reason and would blame for being miserable in life and how i never understood how she feels or what she is going through then she would make me feel bad because my life is a little more cozy than hers. It could go on, and on, and on for 4 - 5 hours straight while i'm juste trying to understand how me losing in overwatch caused all of this.  So in essence, the smallest thing could set her off and she would start emptying her feelings on me like a punching bag ( she never got violent with me but i know she hurts herself but son in any serious way.)

I have endured this for 2 1/2 years but now i'm fed up and for the first time i didnt end this fight by saying i was sorry and writting her a 5 page essay to tell her how much a love her to bits, but instead chose that i didnt desrve to being told to go fuck myself and eat shit so i told her that i was done and then i blocked her everywhere except my cell where she proceeded ( idk if thats a word ) to call me 189 times and send me 230 text messages varying from "" no please i love you why are you doing this to ME"" to "" im gonna kill myself if you leave me"".  I know she wont do it, at least i hope so, but being me i cant live with myself knowing that i caused her pain by leaving her. Pretty sure it sounds silly but thinking about it makes me feel guilty to a point where i wonder if i should stay with her to make her feel better and hope it dosent happen again. 

I know it will most likely happen again but she juste started taking meds for her anxiety and i feel leaving her before seeing any results, like i'm making a huge mistake by leaving her now that she's finally making an effort to better herself despite me telling her for 2 years that maybe she should go see someone about it. I'm juste sad because its too late now seeing as i dont think i love her anymore. 

Am i in the right or am i selfish by doind what i did ? I want your honest opinion as to what you would've done in my place.

I(M29) feel like I am not compatible with my SO(F30) due to different boundaries in our relationship relating to her sexual past. 

Sorry for this long post, I dont know where to go with it and I think I am about to break up with my SO. So we’ve been exclusive for a few months now. She is very very sexually experienced whereas I am kinky but still have a lot of things to tick off my bucket list. Her list is very short. We have really really great sex and I really enjoy spending time with her, and I believe she really likes me.

I have openly told her I’ve had jealousy/trust/insecurity issues in the past and that I dont want to be judgmental so the less I know the better but my problem here is that there are no boundaries for her and there is no privacy. I have this nagging feeling that we are not compatible as she has no lines, whereas I believe sex holds some level of importance and privacy in a relationship for me. 

A month back we went out for her birthday with her friends, many of whom are gay/lesbian. She disclosed in the early stages of us seeing each other that she has, in the past, had a MfM threesome with her gay (obviously clearly bisexual) best best male friend and I told her I felt nervous about being put in this environment and was worried about it. I've never had a threesome and although I would be very uncomfortable meeting this guy I wanted to try for her. She assured me it would be fine once I met him, and not to worry. It turns out he was pretty horrible to me and was very possessive over her and went out of his way to be really nasty to me. (My SO said she wasnt actually surprised by this as he can be very possessive of his GFs and has been mean to outsiders in the past - to me this is a completely toxic relationship to have with any ""friend"") On top of that a couple of friends openly made threesome jokes to make me feel awkward. She also jokingly made out with one of her female friends which was something I had previously said is something I don't think is cool and would be uncomfortable with but she was wasted. All in all it was a disaster for me. We fell out, I felt hurt that she crossed basically the only boundary I set out but mostly felt angry that her and her friends were throwing her sexual past in my face on purpose. It appears to me that the relationship she has with her friends is almost solely based on their sexualities and the sexual experiences they have separately or with each other. Sex makes up 85% of who they are. In my eyes this is immature. Something for a group of young university students - not 30 year old adults.

We talked it through, she apologised profusely for kissing her friend but didn’t think it was a big deal. She was also very angry that her friends had been nasty to me and made me feel awkward and said I wouldn’t ever have to meet them again if I didn’t want to. She really wanted to make it work. So we move passed it because I’m trying to be open minded, but I told her that I need some boundaries for us and I want our relationship to be us and not her telling stories of all the sexual adventures we get up to to this group of friends of hers. I dont want these friends who know every detail of her life (some of whom shes hooked up with) involved in our relationship.

Fast forward: I see on facebook she is tagged in an article about “rimming” by one of her openly sexual friends. (We have tried rimming twice but I know she has done it in the past as well). She then writes a responding comment by basically publicly stating how she loves it. Now this is not a private chat or post. This is a public article on a page post for all to see. I never went searching for it, it literally presented itself to me when on facebook. I feel like after everything that happened, that this might be the last straw for me. I can only be so open minded.

Either 
1. She has told all her friends how she done it with me (which I told her I didnt want) and is publicly announcing it. 
Or 
2. Is publicly announcing to her facebook for anyone to see how she enjoys rimming guys (again throwing her sexual past in my face and not giving a second thought to the fact shes now in a relationship with me)

Even if I wasnt in a relationship with her, I would never ever write/comment/post about such subjects on my public facebook. It wont have even crossed her mind how I might read that comment or how it might make me feel. 

Am I right to feel like this? I am not saying she is wrong. Many people out there are openly kinky, publicly talk about their past. But I have made it very clear that its probably the only thing that I struggle with and it continually gets thrown in my face and is like a weight on my shoulders. I'm sure theres guys out there who wouldnt care about this but I have clearly told her I do and hence I am now continually thinking we arent compatible. I’m going to meet her later tonight and I cant pretend everything is normal anymore. I will need to talk to her. ",relationships,I (M29) think this is my final straw for my relationship with SO(F30).

We used to chill every day and text when we couldn't, but he just hasn't been replying to my texts recently. He used to say I was one of the few people he could stand to be around all day (his girlfriend and other friend were the other two). All month we casually text and I'm the first person he texts whenever he's anxious (he has anxiety and depression). And whenever he needed me, I was right there and completely available to him.

Last week, my anxiety escalated to the point where my school councillor wanted me to go to the ER and stay there a few days. He asked if I wanted to text anyone. Obvious answer? My friend. And he didn't answer me. Eventually, after about an hour, he texts me back a quick ""yeah"" and I text him another thing and doesn't respond for a while to that either, and when he does, it's just another ""yeah"". Eventually my uncle took me home and he doesn't text me for a few days and he doesn't talk to me at school beyond a quick ""hey"" even when we're alone in the same room. He just pulls out his phone and starts playing video games and I try to spark up a conversation but all he says is the same ""yeah"" and moves on. His girlfriend shows up and he immediately gets up and starts talking to her and gets super into their conversation. And that's just been the whole week.

I try to text him the next time I had a bad day and he didn't respond. So I just kind of moved on, but it's been bothering me ever since.

I eventually did have to go to the hospital. I texted him and another friend. A third friend texted me and I told him what was going on and both of my other friends were just so supportive and ""oh my god, what happened, are you okay, how are you making out, I'm sorry I didn't notice"" and he just didn't even bother to respond.

I've just invested so much emotional energy into this one boy and as soon as I ask for him to just let me vent he turns around and leaves me. It's been bothering me, especially since we just made all these plans on what we're doing in university - ""I'm always going to be bothering you in your dorm, we're gonna set you up with a cute boy, we'll take all our classes together, we've gotta join all these clubs"" Whenever he needed a friend to vent to, I was there. His girlfriend did something shitty? I'm there. He's anxious? I'm there. I don't know why he can't be for me.

I tried talking to him about it and he says he's just been busy but whenever I'm hanging out with his girlfriend, he's texting her 24/7. And I get that I'm not his girlfriend, but it's just rough to see him making all the time in the world for her and none for me, supposedly his best friend. I just need someone to be here for me and it seems like the one person I trusted to be there wasn't. It's one thing to text me saying you're busy. It's another to text me that you're busy but text your girlfriend once every minute.

And now that I tell him ""hey, I've been struggling lately, mind if you make some time for me?""

""yeah"" is his only response.

t2_3hsk3rbh,1553737314.0,b6cuje,t3_b6cuje,25,"My (23F) friend, Jake (23M) has been seeing this girl, Anne (22F) for a few months now. They moved in together after only a couple weeks of dating, and 3 months of know each other. It was strange and everyone scratched their heads at it. 

These are the signs to me the relationship is extremely unhealthy and borderline emotionally abusive. I might be sensitive to any signs of this because I’ve been abused and am not sure if I’m being fair, so I’d like people’s opinions. 

Anne doesn’t let Jake attend any social event without her. It doesn’t have to be partying - if our group is meeting for lunch and she can’t make it, even if he is free, Anne doesn’t want him to go. 

Jake can’t be alone with any other girls, under any circumstances. She is extremely paranoid about any girl that’s around him, including me, even though there is zero history or interest between us. 

She also got upset at past photos on his social media with other girls (even non-girlfriends/hookups) and made him delete the photos, saying to keep them up would be “disrespectful” to her - some of them were years old. 

Anne regularly looks through his phone to check up that he’s not hiding anything. When he doesn’t text her for more than maybe 10-20 min when they’re not together she starts freaking out. Demands to see his location from snapchat at all times. (He has never cheated on her or been close, to my knowledge he’s a very faithful bf). 

Anne publicly berates him. She criticizes his appearance a lot, saying he shouldn’t order the fries instead of salad since he’s “getting fat,” constant comments along that nature. 

Jake does everything for her. We’re all in the same uni, he arguably has a heavier workload than her, yet she gets him to write her essays/other work.

Anne has now isolated from his friends entirely. While fighting one day, he told Anne that our group doesn’t like her (we’ve made a couple comments). They made up, and now he isn’t “allowed” to see us anymore and had to block us on social media. 

According to her, we’re trying to tear them apart and want to ruin their happiness. Only thing is, I’ve never seen him less happy. He always seems extremely stressed out and like a shell of himself. 

There’ve also been a couple occasions where she’s thrown things at him, like shoes.

The guys in our group just act like it’s nothing and girlfriends can be like this - I feel if the gender was reversed and our friend was the girl in this relationship, they’d be concerned.

Should I get involved in this and try reaching out, or just leave it be? 

Tl;dr my friend’s girlfriend is extremely controlling and takes it to extreme lengths, treats him poorly and isolates him from his friends.

Also walk around the room on every board and where all of the boards meet to find those that move or squeak and either nail or screw them down.

Then I laid down new underlayment, stapled it every few feet and taped the seams together.

I laid out the first few boards and realized that if I kept going in that direction (horizontal across the entry door frame) I'd need to do a lot of cuts to fit the corners and cutouts by the closet. So I flipped it around the other way. I only needed to make one cut with the table saw for 1 corner. Once the first few boards were in place it went pretty quick, I was able to use 3 or 4 boards across the middle and needed to cut the end piece to fit the other side. I was able to use the other half of the cut piece to start the next row so there wasn't a lot of scrap. I spent about an hour laying down the first few rows then called it a day.

The second day I picked up where I left off and was done in about 2 hours. I needed to make one more cut with a jig saw to go around the heating pipe for the baseboard heating. Thankfully the very last row (against the wall) fit in pretty tight so I didn't need to rip any of the boards.

I used 12mm laminate planks from the ""Home Decorators Collection"" at Home Depot, it was \~$30 a case and I needed 11 cases in total. This planks go together easily, basically you fit them together then push down and they snap into each other. I needed to use a hammer &amp; pull bar on only one piece on the last row against the wall where there wasn't a lot of room to wiggle it into place.

To finish it up I'm going to install saddles across the doorways, then install new baseboard and doorway molding.

Butcher here. Working on converting a refrigerator cutout in my kitchen to a dry curing chamber for making dry-cured sausages and whole muscles. Main issues are humidity and temperature control. 

https://m.imgur.com/t1DHGel

The area is 84.5x21.5x19; measured in inches. I have a landing on top I plan to install 3-4 computer compressor fans with Peltier modules and two internal fans to circulate air. I’ll install a humidifier and control the whole thing through a hygrometer and thermostat that’ll cycle on and off to control temps at safe-ish temps. Plan to install insulation and aluminum walls, and seal with spray foam and weather stripped door. Most heavy lifting will be done by ambient temperature (the house hovers between 65-70F) and the compressors just need to bring it down to 40-50 or so and maintain. 

Does this design make sense? Do I need more fans? Will it be super loud, and on all the time? What would you do to solve this problem? It’s essentially a fridge. Maybe I’d be better off finding a free fridge, removing all the parts and installing it in the alcove? I know converting a refrigerator is easier but it’s also less elegant and this is fucking cool.

I recently acquired a blower motor from a decommissioned fume hood at work. My intention was to use it in a cyclone saw dust extraction system for my table saw. I have since looked at the data sheet and realized that it won't be powerful enough for that, and the fan not open enough to allow much material to pass smoothly.

I'm now wondering if I can use it as a passive dust collector for finer dust. I've seen posts of people using a large box fan with furnace filter as a cheap dust collector. Does anyone know whether this fan will work (using a smaller filter)?

Any help or suggested uses for the fan are greatly appreciated.

[https://imgur.com/a/YpWfhCs](https://imgur.com/a/YpWfhCs)

&amp;#x200B;

We found an old ""pop-up"" camper on which the roof was destroyed, making it virtually worthless. (originally a 2011 Palomino 4124  [http://www.rvguide.com/specs/palomino/expandable-trailer/2011/y-series/y-4124.html](http://www.rvguide.com/specs/palomino/expandable-trailer/2011/y-series/y-4124.html) )  I've always wanted a camper, but needed inexpensive and one that fit inside a garage. We decided to make a hard sided pop up camper. We made a sort of a clam shell construction in which we added a bottom portion that has a top portion that comes down over it. By lowering the top portion, we decrease the height by about 30%. That way, it is easier to tow and fits in the garage.

&amp;#x200B;

Our construction has gone well, and I'm proud of what we accomplished. The problem is that the lift mechanism is sort of a pulley thing left over from the soft sided. It lifts the top, but not always exactly evenly. We need it to be even and exact in order to put in the door when the top portion is up.

&amp;#x200B;

Our plan was to place something inside the trailer along the top on the bottom wall (the top of the bottom wall is little larger than a 2x4 to stand something on) that would brace onto the ceiling and hold up the top portion. Perhaps we would have some shelves that would sit on top of the bottom wall to hold up the top portion. However, once we do that, we need something to brace the shelves and hold up the top portion. The shelf (or whatever we use to brace up the top portion) would need to ""expand"" by an inch or so so that they are braced into position. The roof portion probably weighs about 400 pounds, so it needs to be able to hold up more than that in a stable manner.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked into small bottle jacks being placed on top to hold up the top, but that seems like overkill, would take time to position, and will ruin the finished look. We would like some sort of cam lock or something that could be used to make a single move or turn and have it locked into place and hold everything where it should be. I don't want the addition to be an ugly use of space, so I figured I would attach something to a shelf that would stand on top of the bottom shelf once the top is up. I need something that will jam it in place and secure everything to hold up the top portion.

 Anyone have any idea of how to do that and make it, or purchase something, that would fit those requirements?

However, there has been one major problem from the very beginning: We don’t have a lot of common interests, the most prominent divergence being our stances on  traveling.

She really loves to travel. In fact I would say that traveling might be the biggest source of fulfillment in her life.

I on the other hand don’t enjoy it at all. I am, and always have been, a restless workoholic with more hobbies and side projects than I can keep up with. One week of leisure is the most I can withstand before I’m starting to get nervous. Sight-seeing leaves me thinking that watching a documentary would have been fine too… and a lot cheaper. On top of that I lead a very environmentally conscious lifestyle and am concerned about what all the unnecessary flying is doing to our planet.

She knows this, though I don’t think she realizes the extent. Last year she flew three times, of which I only joined her once, which is pretty much the biggest compromise I’m willing to make. We’re both about to finish college soon. She already hinted that she wants to utilize the time after her graduation for a more extended journey, which is not really an option for me. We talked about that, *eventually,* we both want to have a family, but I'm afraid that our plans up to this point differ a lot.

We'd been together four years when it started. Online poker, siphoned out and blew through almost $1500 we had saved for a down payment on a house. I gave her the biggest ultimatum, that I would leave if it continued. She went to therapy, she got help, it turned out she was hideously depressed and the gambling was a side effect? Bullshit, right? Total cop-out.

So we postponed the wedding after that and worked to rebuild trust. Our son was born. Life was peachy again for another, what, until 2015. 2015 was the big one.

This time it was the casino and a second bank account that I didn't know about. She'd been putting money into it every paycheck and ""working late"" for god knows how long. And I caught her again. And we fought again. And she went to therapy again. Now she says her depression is because she's transgender, and I mean, I'm supportive. I'm not a homophobe or anything. Whatever will make her better, you know? She's the love of my life, and aside from the depression and gambling our life was great.

So she starts transitioning. I have to start calling her Ruth. We wanted a second child, didn't want our boy to grow up an only child, so we started trying. After I became pregnant with our daughter, that was it. Like, I love her, but I'm not gay, you know? She's the father of my children and my best friend in the world but I don't even like to touch her anymore. It makes me uncomfortable.

So that brings us to yesterday. Things got back to normal soon enough. She's made tremendous strides in her transition and is legally a woman which made me so proud and so happy all at the same time. Our kids are growing up happy and well looked after. We have a house, two cars, a nice income. Everything is great.

Until I find the paperwork for a private loan of $8000 dated three months ago. I confronted her about it, demanded she show me the money, show me where it is. She couldn't. She just played dumb. It has her new legal name right on it. She swears up and down she's not gambling again, but what the hell else could it be?

I left with the kids and am writing this from my mother's house. I don't know what to do. I love her with all my heart but this just keeps on happening. What do I do? I want so badly to go back to him, but can I justify it after all she's put me through? I want my kids to have their father in their life. I want my best friend in my life.

We were in the same friend group for the last couple years, which is a relatively wild friend group (various people are poly, LGBT, use some kinds of substances). And only a few months ago did we realize we had feelings for each other and we become a couple. All of our friends are so happy for us and it’s awesome.

Just one thing, is my boyfriend came into the friend group when our friend “Stella” had met him on an unsuccessful Tinder date. All I know is they probably went out once, it wasn’t a match, and now he’s been in the friend group ever since, after she invited him to a party after the date.

So I don’t know if they kissed, had sex, or what, before they became platonic. I know it doesn’t really matter, and he loves me SO much, and I trust both of them that nothing has been romantic between them ever since. I also feel like I’m setting myself up for a bad time whenever I ask him about it. What should I do? Is it better just not knowing?

I looked it up and it's something about the bladder and prostate being close to each other. 

He was very embarrassed about it after, which again to clarify the humiliation didn't turn me on. I have come to the conclusion that what turns me on is that my primate brain found it very hot that I literally fucked the piss out of him.

Everything should be fine, he's kind and caring and motivated and great in bed, pretty much checks all my boxes. However, recently when we hang out I've started to get annoyed with him for no real reason. Over really little things, like him being slightly more critical of a movie than I am, or him disliking something I like, just blowing small things out of proportion.

I think it's mostly my anxiety making things worse. It's caused me to be snippy and rude to him and frankly he's getting pretty tired of it. Now it's gotten to the point where I wonder if we should break up just so I can spare him the struggle of having to deal with me. It's like this intrusive thought that's burrowing into my brain and I can't get rid of it (yes I am currently in therapy to work on this but progress is slow).

t2_7odo4rl,1553823166.0,b6rb76,t3_b6rb76,0,"So my siblings and I (F29)have always lived in the same house together, I moved out twice for about a year each time and they havent. I am F(29) and I have two sisters 22 and 26 and a brother 17. We used to fight a lot as kids and teenagers but as adults we pretty much get along. We all have the same habits because we have been living in the same household for so long so we dont really fight as much. 
A part of me feels that because of this living situation we have sort of lost touch and connection in a small sense. When I moved out once and came to visit I felt we connected more, lots of hugs and kisses hello and goodbye and I stood hanging out with them rather than going to my room or my siblings going to theirs but since they dont see me they would stay for an hour or so to hang out. 
I feel we are so busy with our lives and since we live together we dont make time to hang out, except for birthdays etc. The most we do is we watch tv a lot and cook and hang in the kitchen, which I'm happy for so I dont even know why i feel I have to give so much background details.

But the thing is my sister (26) is engaged (about 6 months in) and shes been with him since she was 17 so hes basically my brother (he is here everyday) My problem is that as sisters  I think we should feel more excited. Like going with her to try dresses on and helping pick things and all that stuff people usually do or maybe I just see it in movies and assume real people can express things so easily. I'm happy for her and I wish I could be more active and stop thinking what I should be doing. I keep wanting to make a website for her, but I dont. It's like we say a lot together and agree on things but never do it and we literally sleep right next to each other in the attic (separate rooms). My sister is the type of person who goes all out for people at parties like just today there was a decorations she bought for a baby shower coming up. I get what shes doing, shes doing this so that when she has parties people help. She once threw herself a party and no one helped her with anything. She always brings stuff or makes sweet tables etc for others but thats just how my family is (aunts and cousins) everyone brings a dish or helps out so idk why no one helped her that time (maybe it was bad timing). So her wedding is coming up and I'm wondering if people are going to help. We are a very creative family where we like to DIY and save a buck. 

I always feel awkward when I get close to my family. Idk why, we have always been close, but not close of you get me. We talk about our day and stuff and topics but like when my gramps passed I remember my mom so sad and I hugged her all but I still feel like I couldnt be there 100 and open up , these people are my people why do I feel this way?

Recently my mom came to visit since I had to be hospitalized (I’m ok now). A package from amazon arrived this morning for me; the package in question was a gun controller for my PlayStation VR headset. She has been going all day about how violent games are evil and how I’m wasting my life away doing nothing noteworthy of it. How I’m still immature and how I should stop “my little games”. 

She’s been pretty hurtful about it too, comparing me with others from my generation that are now homeowners and / or married (IMO it’s easy to be a homeowner when costs are 8x lower in your hometown compared to a big city such as where I live). 

She also says she’s dissapointed I spend so much time on my phone, even when I tell her I’m actually replying to some important conversations, which she doesn’t believe I have. 

No matter what I do or say I’m a failure when compared to others my age, or at least that’s today’s argument.  She says I’m living in a ”virtual unreality” and that my depression isn’t real but rather caused by my hobbies. 

She’s a great mom otherwise, but she won’t accept my hobbies (even though nowadays I indulge in 5 hours a week at most on games due to work / excercise) and won’t be happy until I stop. 

I game because I do not have that many friends on my new city. What can I tell her to get her to back off a little? Or is she right?

Until then, my moms anxiety has been severely affecting my social life. She is very terrified of something happening to me, which i completely understand. But i think the absolute lack of taking any risks is making me isolated and lonely.

She won’t let me take uber/lyft alone, can’t take public transit after dark, etc. because she’s worried something bad will happen to me. If i make plans to take a lyft, she’ll just drive me instead. But then i feel guilty for the inconvenience, and like i can’t stay out late because she wants to go to bed. Also, it’s embarrassing to have my mom drop me off and pick me up. 

I had a coffee date from tinder last week and she completely stressed me out beforehand, making me promise i wouldn’t leave the coffee shop. then reminding me off all the homework and chores i should be doing instead of a date (it was like one hour!!!! and the only social interaction i’ve had in weeks!!) by the time I got there I was almost crying and just wanted to cancel the date. 

I’ve had to cancel plans because my mom is too busy and stressed out. She can’t accomplish anything if i’m out with someone new or somewhere in the city at night because she needs to watch my location and make sure i’m staying where i should be and not kidnapped or something.

I’d like to go to someone’s apartment as a third date, we’ve been talking for a few weeks and i feel comfortable with it, but i’m already anticipating that my mom will say it’s too soon and i shouldn’t trust them yet. 

The biggest problem is that SHE CONVINCES ME to be anxious as well. She talks about all the bad things that could happen to me and get me all nervous and freaked out so i don’t even wanna go anymore. 

I’m getting really frustrated, but i really don’t know how to change the situation/boundaries, or if i just have to wait until i have enough money to move out. Does anyone have experience with a situation like this? 

after my date last week she said she can’t turn it off, and that she feels responsible since i live with her she has to make sure nothing happens to me or she won’t be able to live with herself. I respect her a lot and feel bad that she gets so stressed out, but I also am at the end of my rope.

She was with our kids (three kids total, aged 3-5 years) all week on spring break. She went 2 hours away to her parents for a visit.  I was home all week due to work.  She got home today around 4.  I called her on my way home around 5. 

When I called, I simply asked what we were going to do for dinner as I was hungry and wanted to bring something home.  I suggested Chipotle. She was “too tired to plan” and told me to just come home and we will discuss then.  I’m sightly annoyed because it’s I efficient but whatever. 

I get home.  The kids are asleep.  It’s not the typical nap time but they’re sick so it’s understandable and I don’t really care.  I tried to discuss dinner with her, but again she says she’s too tired and wants to take a 30 minutes.  

In the hour she was napping, I snack on some cheese and lunch meat.  I also get the kids up from their late naps.  Wife wakes up and is of course hungry now and I’m not.  

She orders herself Chipotle and some food for the kids and tells me she’s going to go pick it up. I’m annoyed at this point because I wanted Chipotle for dinner, but I filled up on cheese and lunch meat because she refused to plan wit me.   I say okay... 20 minutes goes by and she’s perplexed as to why I haven’t left to get the food.  Fine...I go pick up the food.  

When I return home, I’m pissy.  I’m annoyed that she refused to plan dinner with me or let me know what she was doing so I could plan around her.  I’m annoyed because of the lack of planning has made it such that it’s 8:30, the kids need to be bathed, and I need to leave the house by 4am tomorrow for work. 

I pretty calmly express my frustration. No yelling or anything but I’m curt.  I tell her I’m annoyed about dinner, I’m annoyed about it being so late and that 2 minutes of planning would have helped all of this. She she plops her chipotle in front of me and tells me to eat it because she’s not hungry anymore because “we don’t have a good marriage anymore.”  

All I want is for her to communicate her needs/desires/plans so we can plan accordingly together.  We both work full time.  We have three young kids.  It’s exhausting, I get it.  How do we plan better?  I’ve been asking for better communication for months.  Is it me at this point? 

FWIW, she has been with the kids at her parents house all week. I’m sure she’s tired.  She’s annoyed with me because I’m also tired I’ve clocked nearly 80 hours this week at work - did it to get caught up while she’s away.

Some background - I am a 25 yo white, American female who has been dating a 25 yo Indian (Gujarati), American born male for 4 years. I love my boyfriend very much but unfortunately my patience is running thin with the state of our relationship and clashing cultural differences. 

My boyfriend and I met in college 5-6 years ago. We were friends at first and started dating at 21. We were roommates (parents didn’t know) together with a bunch of people and started growing close and then started dating while living together. After college we moved our separate ways physically, him back with his parents and me independently. We’ve been semi long distance for 3 years  and I only see him about once a week for a few hours since we have to sneak around. 

Problem: my boyfriend is still financially dependent 100% on his parents. He is trying to look for a job but hasn’t had any luck. Because of this dependence, I feel like his parents control him and I’m growing resentful of them. For one, he has STILL not yet told his parents that I exist or that he’s dating someone. We’ve had many conversations about this and I get the cultural implications of it but it has been 4 years so I’m increasingly frustrated and growing impatient. I understand the beginning because of the no dating in Asian culture piece, but we’ve been very serious together for a couple of years now. Because his parents don’t know he’s dating, we have to sneak around. He can’t go out too often because he gets screamed at by his parents. When he does go out to see me he lies to them so he feels bad. We plan on telling them about us next month, but I’m scared he won’t stand up for me when/if they disapprove as he hasn’t shown he can yet. He’s afraid to stand up to them as he thinks they’ll kick him out and cut him off. Im afraid they’re never going to let him come over or see me. He convinced me to trust him that he will stand up to them when he makes money, but I find it so hard to trust and believe this. I’m 100% financially independent, have been for 3 years, and ready for the next step in our relationship. We talk about this and he is ready too mentally, but not ready because of his life instability. You can bet he can’t catch a break from them because of this instability. We’ve been stuck in this limbo for so long and we fight constantly about it because he doesn’t believe he’s being controlled and is frustrated being pulled all different ways. I try as hard as I can to be supportive but I feel I have cut him so much slack and am annoyed at our relationship since it’s so abnormal. He’s assured me time and time again that he would never accept an arranged marriage but you never know. 

Please offer any advice or similar experiences. I love him so deeply he’s so kind and funny and sweet, but this I feel this is ruining our relationship as my anger and resentment grows. I honestly don’t know if it’s worth staying anymore.

So we finally hung out at a burger place like two days ago and honestly I talked a lot about myself. He asked and got my last name, birthday, and like idk. He wanted to know about me and I kinda just gave in? He did talk about him but it felt like it was mostly about me. 

Secondly, even though it was our only encounter hanging out he did stand really close, but I didnt mind but then he would brush against me.

We were walking, and when he did brush against me or something he said he wantes to walk on one side of the sidewalk He kept switching. He always walked on the side of the sidewalk closet to the street? Ive never seen anyone constantly switching like that before. It could have been an excuse to brush against me but who knows. I have no idea how common that it.

The entire time it felt sorta off. It was somewhat akward sure, but other times its doesnt feel like idk.. kinda creepy?

Maybe its because I have this feeling he might kinda like me but I feel weird cuz I dont like him like that (if he does). 

The moment that really got me kinda creeped a little was that he sent me a facebook request. He never really said anything about adding eachother, he just said he swore he saw me on his reccomendations list of friends. I was confused on how the heck he would remember that but idk. 

So he basically asked my last name and searched it up on fb, and well I did add him since idk im nice I guess? He immediately texted me after and that was a bit more ehh.

No matter how many times i replay the event or write it out or talk about it, I can't seem to move past the frustration and resentment from it. I've even tried a bit of therapy and I'm still stuck ruminating.

My bf (36M) came over to my (31F) place for the day and we'd spent the majority of it in the bedroom. We eventually realized it was late and I needed to cook us dinner. I have very bad acid reflux that acts up if I go too long between meals, so I threw some bread in the toaster hoping it would help calm down the acid build up enough to stop me from puking. 

I grabbed the margarine from my fridge while he sat on the couch watching. He told me not to butter the toast because it would make the acid worse. Fats don't trigger my reflux, so I responded that it wasn't a problem and it wouldn't upset my stomach, and anyways it was one of those ultra low fat margarines, not a high fat butter. 
He responded with ""Ew, gross."" Got up off the couch, approached me, grabbed the butter knife out of my hand and firmly said ""you're not eating that."" He was completely serious, not joking.

I saw red. I didn't start yelling, but I stood there quietly shaking in anger for a couple of minutes. I took another knife from the drawer, buttered my toast, and (pretty calmly without a raised voice) told him he was totally out of line and if he ever pulled another stunt like that he'd be out. I couldn't even look him in the eye I was so mad.

He got upset, said I was making a big deal over nothing and was way over reacting. Told me ""I don't know why you're mad at me, I'm not abusive."" (Which came out of nowhere, I never used the word abuse at any point in time)

I thought about it, but ultimately said that I wasn't accusing him of being abusive, but I didn't think I was out of line, I'd been managing my reflux for many years and knew my triggers and what was ok to ingest, and he didn't get to decide that for me or control what I eat.

We dropped the topic after that, and he broke up with me a week later, saying I'm full of red flags and have anger issues. 

Thinking about this fight several months later, my blood still boils when I remember him yanking the knife away because he apparently thinks marg is gross. So is he right? Do I have anger issues? Was I in the wrong for being upset? I've tried addressing anger as a whole with CBT and a therapist, but until I'm put in a similarly stressful situation I won't know if I've successfully stomped all anger out of me.

t2_16jsil,1553822152.0,b6r4xt,t3_b6r4xt,0,"A few months ago, my wife stared a new job. To give some background, my wife works in a broad field, but in a very specific, niche part of that field (think of a lawyer that practices a very specific kind of law).

She worked in her previous job for 5 years, and while she enjoyed the work and the flexibility her job had (she could work from home anytime she wanted), but those were pretty much the only good things about her job. The management there was terrible, her other co-workers were cliquish, the benefits were bad, there was lots of instability, and my wife generally felt unsupported in her role. There were many days that she would come home and practically be in tears because of how frustrated she was with the job. She had passively looked at different jobs a few times, but kept going back because she enjoyed the work and the flexibility, despite things getting worse. 

The final straw came a few months ago, when her old job announced that all staff members would have to take a 6% pay cut. At that point, she kicked her job search into full gear, and quickly found a job with the county government. While the job is in her field, it doesn’t have quite the same duties as her old role, as she’s not interacting with clients, and is doing more “office work.” However, it came with a healthy pay raise, is only 10 minutes away from home, and with all the benefits and job security that a government job offers.

However, she’s been at her new job for two months, and she doesn’t like it. Since it’s doing less interacting with clients than she’s used to, she feels very bored and that she’s not challenged and making a difference like in her old job. Much like at the old job, she comes home practically in tears because she’s so unhappy.

I totally sympathize with having a job that you don’t like and aren’t being challenged at; I’ve been there before and it totally sucks. However, I personally feel that she’s got to give it more of a chance, as she’s only been there for two months. Going back to her old job isn’t a realistic option, and probably not one to go down given her unhappiness there. In terms of other jobs in her field, they don’t really exist unless she wanted to take a larger pay cut than we could realistically swing, which isn’t ideal as we’re hoping to start trying to get pregnant later this year. 

I guess my trouble is figuring how to be supportive. On one hand, I hate to see her so unhappy in her job. On the other hand, I also feel like she’s being a bit unrealistic about her expectations, and I sometimes want to tell her “hey, if there aren’t any other realistic options to work in your speciality area, this doesn’t seem so bad, so maybe you should suck it up and deal with it?” Or is there some kind of middle ground in how to help her be supportive?

t2_3i00cymc,1553821707.0,b6r2bb,t3_b6r2bb,3,"This is a legit post and I know I’m wrong in many aspects. I’m not here to dispute that. I’m here to seek help and see what options I have with getting some help. So here goes. Gonna be a long post 

I’m currently 39 years old. I’ve been with my wife, let’s call her Janet, since I was 20. When Janet and I first got together, I was the jealous type. She was (still is) smoking hot and instead of being appreciative of a having sexy gorgeous woman on my arm, I’d get mad if I saw other guys looking at her. To put it in perspective, one day fairly early on in our relationship, we went to the beach. On the way home, Janet continued to wear her bikini top. I was seeing guys in other cars trying to ogle her and I got upset and told her to put a shirt on. She didn’t like that. That was the type of stupid shit that started steamrolling out of control. I was wrong. I don’t dispute that. I have insecurities apparently. 

During the first few months of being together, one of her ex-Bfs came into the picture. They were “just friends” is what she had told me so they talk sometime. I wasn’t ok with it and it started arguments more often than not. Eventually my insecurities and possessiveness became too much and we split up. Long story short, she ending up spending a night at his house. During our split, I ended up meeting up with one of my ex’s. When I was with my ex, we talked for a bit and literally NOTHING happened. I realized I didn’t want my ex, I wanted Janet. Janet and I ended up getting back together after about two weeks. I wasn’t happy about what she had told me had happened while we were split but what could I do about it. We technically weren’t together at the time. I promised to change. She believed me. 

Somewhere in the mix, I met a girl at work and started talking to her. Not gonna lie, I wanted to hook up with her but we never did. I ended up telling Janet about it,  and apologized. She was pissed. We fought for a while and ended up trying to fix things. Shortly after that, she told me she was moving to FL to be with her sick mom who was also moving to FL. At the time, we lived in New England. She told me I could come or we could split up but either way, she was going. I decided to leave the only home I’ve ever known and move 1200mi. away with Janet. This was in 2003. 

Once in FL, it was her and I. After paying for the move, we had $400 to our name. We both got jobs and started building our life together. I was still getting jealous over stupid things but kept telling her I’d change and she kept believing me. I really wanted to change and I did for a while. 

Things got real good for us. We both had decent paying jobs and we had a relationship that all our friends were jealous of. We got married in 2007 and in late 2008, had our first child. A beautiful baby girl. After our daughter was born, I was putting in 50+ hours a week at my job and a lot of those hours were night hours where I didn’t get home to close to midnight. My wife, on the other hand, worked Mon-Fri 9-5. We weren’t spending as much time together and apparently she felt like I wasn’t helping out with our daughter as much as she’d like me to have.

While my daughter was about 1, my wife started taking to a guy at her job. Once I found out about it, I was heart broken and confronted the guy. He told me he didn’t want to come between my wife and I and that he was sorry and he wouldn’t talk to my wife anymore. That was the truth. They stopped talking and my wife and I were left to try to fix our relationship. Apparently it didn’t last too long bc she started talking to yet another guy at her job. This guy was married and also had a child about our daughters age. Once I found out about this, I was livid. We fought and at one point, she ended up leaving for two weeks to stay with her mom. Before she left, though, I had tried to confront the new guy she was talking to but he avoided me like the plague. My last resort was to track down his address and go talk to HIS wife. His wife acted like she wasn’t too surprised and like it wasn’t a big deal. Either way, they stopped talking I think. Who knows. 

Fast forward a couple months and I find yet ANOTHER guy at her job was trying to talk to her. I confronted him, too.  My wife didn’t do anything really wrong here per-say, but she didn’t tell me someone else was trying to talk to her. 

Fast forward to today. Since all that BS happened, it’s been close to 10 years. Our daughter is 10 and we also have a 5 year old son now, too. I love both my kids more than life itself. I’m also still head over heels in love with my wife but I do not know how to let go of the past. I do not 100% trust her and I don’t know how to get over that. I honestly don’t want to be with or have eyes for anyone else but her. But she’s tired of me not fully trusting her. 

I WANT to trust her. I really do but I don’t know how to. It’s been 10 years since all that but she still works with that one guy who’s wife I had to talk to. I don’t think anything is going on but I don’t know how to stop thinking that something is. 

My mind works in fucked up ways. If I don’t hear from my wife on her lunch break, my mind automatically thinks she’s somewhere with him. Or if she has to leave the house to go to the store, I automatically think she’s running off to secretly meet someone. 99% of the time, I keep these thoughts to myself or I’ll ask subtle questions to see what she’s up to. I don’t want to feel this way. Occasionally, I’ll say something stupid and she’ll know that I don’t trust her. At this point, she’s tired of living like this and is contemplating leaving. We’re about to start counseling together so I’m really hoping that it can help us/me. How do I get over my insecurities and trust my wife again 100%. How do I stop these thoughts that I have. Let’s be clear, I don’t think she is doing anything right now with anyone but my mind automatically jumps to that all the time.  I hate being this way and feeling like this but at the same time, I seriously don’t want to be with anyone else but her.

There’s more I can get into but for the time being, I think this sufficiently explains our current situation. 

Please fell free to ask my any questions or if you want me to be more specific about anything I said. I’ll be 100% honest about everything.  

TLDR: I’ve had jealously problems for my whole almost-20yr relationship with my wife. She’s “cheated” on me in the past and I don’t know how to get over it for her sake and mine. I do not want to be like this. How do I overcome this?

t2_3hr7hbhs,1553723895.0,b6afbm,t3_b6afbm,84,"My boyfriend is... ‘strange’, for lack of better words. Not in a bad way, just he has his little harmless quirks and I don’t have a problem with any of them. It’s all part of what makes him as a person and I love him, quirks and all.

Although one thing he does (that has started to become more frequent) is his apologizing. It’s not like this is a new thing, but it’s starting to bother me and I feel awful for snapping at him whenever he apologizes.

Like I said, it’s not a new thing. We met online (he used to live in the Netherlands) and we were talking for a few years before he came to visit me. The first thing I said when I saw him was something like “wow you’re taller than I thought you would be” (not word for word but something like that... he’s 6’1) and his immediate response was to apologize?

I dunno. I thought it was cute and I assured him that it was fine and that he doesn’t have to apologize for his height ? A little strange, but cute.

He would apologize for things that he really doesn’t have to apologize for. Like something that happens frequently would be when we’re on a date and he’d have to use the bathroom. He’d apologize, excuse himself, give an explanation, apologize again, do his business, come back, and then apologize again.

Like. He doesnt have to apologize for using the bathroom, much less apologize 3 times. I already explained to him that he doesn’t have to apologize so much (or apologize at all) for taking care of a basic human need and he’d just go “oh. sorry.”

It’s starting to get a little frustrating. Fast forward a few years and we now live together (in an apartment) and oh my gosh he apologizes *so* much for little to no reason.

Like I’d just. Point out little things. Not in an angry / annoyed or accusing tone, just as an observation. Like “oh, you ate the last cookie” or “its your turn to make dinner tonight” would result in a bunch of apologies, “it’ll never happen again op”, etc. etc.

It bothers me because his apologies are 100% genuine. You can tell he feels really bad even though there’s nothing to be sorry about.

It’s something my parents / sister has noticed too apparently. They weren’t bothered by it, just a little concerned, asked if he was okay. My sister joked that if she didn’t know me / how our relationship is, she would assume that I’m abusing him or something.

I don’t know if this is related, but he tends to get startled easily. He’d flinch / jump if I make any sudden movements (and then apologize for it). Whenever I ask him if he’s okay, he’d say that he’s fine, apologize for worrying me etc.

I can’t tell if I’m annoyed or concerned. Like, I’m kind of concerned at this point because now its beginning to be a bit much, but annoyed because I really don’t understand what’s going through his mind, why he feels that he has to apologize so much.

We never fight, I don’t raise my voice at him, I don’t hit him. All of these things (the apologizing, the flinching) has been there since the start of our relationship, only it’s been getting worse. He won’t talk about it. He always says that he’s fine:

&amp;#x200B;

**The Background:**

I have been with Phillis for about 2.5 years, we live together and I have become essentially the stepfather to her 10 year old girl despite not being married as of yet.

We were introduced to each other by Bob and TwoFace (with the latter being Phillis friend).

I have a pretty close knit group of friends, Of which Bob and TwoFace are a part. Bob has been part of this group from the start (Talking like 20 years), TwoFace, only around 4 years or so and was brought into the group by being with Bob.

Phillis is also involved with this group of friends now, obviously brought in due to being with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Phillis has a group of 3 other friends that she has known for around 20 years also. The Caveat of that being that they didn’t speak to each other at all for about 12 years, due to Phillis being bullied pretty badly by them and her eventually getting sick of it and cutting of contact. They started speaking again about 4-5 years ago (Before Bob and TwoFace were together). They all have a group chat going on a phone app where they arrange nights out etc. She sees them maybe once every two months. The conversations are usually along the lines of them arranging a night out between themselves where they want to go for drinks, then after they’ve got a date/time/location set they ask Phillis to come (and drive, pick them all up from their 3 different towns, take them to where they are going, not drink, then take them all home). She often can’t, because she is at full time uni and works part time on evenings/weekends.

They will then have a huge go at her that she ‘doesn’t care about them’ and ‘never comes out’.

They have had her in tears more than once since I've been with her and when she does got on a night out with them, she is sick to her stomach with anxiety about 50% of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Stage is set:**

Phillis and her friends were talking a couple of months ago about there being a concert coming up and that they would all try to get tickets to it (I am unaware of this conversation at this time). Phillis asked me if I wanted to go to this concert, I said yes.

Flash forward to ticket release day, I am trying to buy tickets (from work), so is Phillis (from home). She manages to get a pair of tickets and so do I. I find out that a couple of close friends from this group didn’t manage to get tickets and I offer them to them.

These guys are really close with both me and Phillis, we go on weekend breaks with them, they always buy gifts for the kid, always make effort with us, are genuinely nice people. Recently we booked to go away with them and another couple we know. These guys paid for the entire thing (flights, accommodation, car hire etc) on their credit card to make things easier for everyone and didn’t even want the money off of anyone till CC interest etc was due.

&amp;#x200B;

I have quite a commute home, by the time I get back, it has come to light that;

* TwoFace and Bob have got tickets.
* Cheater and Stevie have got tickets, and 2 extra.
* Orange did not manage to get any before they sold out, but wants 2 (despite the fact that Beef doesn’t want to go).

&amp;#x200B;

Phillis asks if we can give my tickets to Orange, and I tell her that I’ve already offered them to our friends. I tell Phillis who and she agrees and suggests that we don’t ask for any money for them as a thankyou for all they’ve done for us recently.

**NOTE:** Phillis has not offered or promised these tickets to Orange, she just assumed that she could have them and Phillis said she would ask me about it.

At this point, all shit kicks off in this group chat, they hurl about at Phillis calling her worse than shit, that she doesn’t care about them, isn’t a true friend, is ruining Oranges plans by not giving her the tickets. They then start to tell her to give one of the tickets she has for me and her to Orange and that it’s my fault for giving mine away, Phillis can do what she wants with her tickets. She’s known them longer, should respect them more. This goes on from 6pm, until 11:30pm while Phillis is trying to complete a Uni assignment that is due in in a couple of days. The abuse they give her gets so bad that she ends up in tears and I ask what’s going on. After some persuading I finally get her to show me the messages they have been sending her.

TwoFace has not offered to give up one of her tickets and not go with her husband (but is expecting this of Phillis). Cheater has not offered ANY of her tickets to Orange despite having 4 and being fully on board with Phillis not going with me also.

*Disgusted* is the only work that comes to mind. These people are acting like teenagers in a school yard. Straight up bullying Phillis about this and calling her worse than shit.

To say that I lost my shit is an understatement.

TwoFace is the only one I have any contact information for. I message her on FaceBook and very politically say that I know it’s not her doing it (it most definitely was) but that I want the bullying and digs at Phillis to stop. This is all over a set of tickets that I bought anyway and they had no say over them and wouldn’t be getting any tickets off of us.

She decides to go to bed. Cheater finally offers Orange her tickets.

Orange says that everything is sorted now.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, Orange and TwoFace have both talked to Phillis normally, although Cheater has not spoken to her at all. Phillis have even seen TwoFace a couple of times in person (both with and without me there) and she was absolutely fine with her. Sharing bottles of wine and smoking together.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Final Act:**

Weeks have passed with nothing said about this.

&amp;#x200B;

This week, Phillis gets a private message from Cheater saying that her, Orange and TwoFace have been talking about her and have decided that the 3 of them need a chat with her. Phillis asks what about, because both TwoFace and Orange have spoken to her and are fine with her, but that is Cheater wants to talk things out, she is more than welcome to meet up.

Cheater declines to see her alone and says that all 3 of them are there or she will not speak to her.

At this point TwoFace posts a long abusive message in the group chat, telling Phillis that ‘something is wrong’ with her and she isn’t giving her old friends the respect they deserve.

Phillis offers to talk to them in our house, and will even ask me to go out for the night. They say no, they want her in a pub or restaurant, not in her own house.

Orange chimes in that she and Cheater are not bullies and that *Frank* (Me) must be a bully. Then the 3 of them start getting on at her with things like;

* “Are you scared of him?”
* “Does he not let you do what you want?”
* “Does he not let you see your friends?” (To which she replies, truthfully, that I am the one who encourages her to see her friends despite her having little free time and usually being exhausted from Uni/Work. This is because I think having friends that you both have asa couple, and that you have as your ‘own’ is important)
* “Don’t take him to the concert, put your foot down, show him whos boss.”
* “You’re in an abusive relationship, don’t let him do this to you.”
* “If Beef did that to me, I’d throw him out.” (Orange doesn’t work and lives in Beefs house rent free, just as an amusing aside)
* “You shouldn’t show other people what we say in here.”
* TwoFace- “I couldn’t speak to you about this by myself while there were other people there”
* And the kicker that “We think this friendship is done unless you tell him to pack his bags”.

All over them not getting tickets to a concert, they are trying to get Phillis to ruin her (our) relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Phillis tells me, shows me the messages and is FURIOUS about what they are doing. But she has also been in tears a few more times, hasn’t been sleeping and is generally stressing out about it. She is sometimes too nice for her own good and always wants to be friends with everyone/see the good in people.

&amp;#x200B;

From my point of view, I’m furious due to the fact they’ve just started making shit up about Phillis and I’s relationship, which, thanks to TwoFaced being connected to our close-knit group of friends, could end up getting out as a rumour. It’s also not something I would want anyone to think was true about me, even for a second.

&amp;#x200B;

TwoFace has also messaged Phillis since in a private chat to ask if she is OK, saying that things went a bit too far in the group chat.

**Afterword:**

I’m not really sure why I’m posting this. I don’t see a solution or resolution to it, but I hate seeing Phillis in this state. I want her to be happy and to have her own friends, but these people seem like disgusting, immature, toxic people that only seem to bully her/make her cry. It seems like they are angry that she is sticking up for herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also now in an awkward situation with Bob, I don't want this to impact our friendship, but I also don't want his wife telling him made up shit about me. I don't want to bring it up with him, because we have always had the agreement that what happens between the girls stays between the girls. But this is some next level bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

But I guess seeing what other people think in an anonymous forum could be good?

When I arrive back to MX the perfect plan of getting back in 6 months to Germany was total ruined by mexican and german burocracy.

So we continue and try to survive (me, mostly) and just going foward. Then he cancel coming to MX and that add just more tension to our relationship but we were just holding.

Over a month and a half ago, the requierments for the german visa got pretty much impossible for me to go foward. So we thought we will break up bc of that and we were pretty sad for a week or so. Until he said he needed to confess me something and if after this I still love him he will marry me, and basically was that he had sex w other girl (only sex, not feelings) and he want the freedom to still do it. Which yes it hurt me AF, but I always thought is natural to get atracted by other persons not just one, so yeah whatever we let it go.

And we start planning the wedding thing and as time goes by I started noticing that he procastinate A LOT on getting his papers done. And I started to PUSH him and ask for things get faster. And this add a lot of tension to our relationship and I started to noticied him distance and many times I asked what is going? is you ok? all good? And his answers were, all good, all cool w me, nothing wrong.

A few days ago, we had a fight and he basically told me that he dont see me as his partner anymore, that he doesnt love me anymore. That he feels on a cage w me. But bc I am important to him and he wants the best for me, he'll marry me anyways.

I told him that if he is consceous that we need to live together for the visa requiements and he said yes, is no prob for him to sleep on the same bed, or share the same space, maybe things flow, maybe not but he doesnt want to give me false hopes of us getting back together.

We've had sexual issues before like any couple but the most recent one is getting annoying. There's been some resentment between boyfriend and I due to financial difficulties, and he's unwinding in unhealthy ways.

E.g. yesterday, we were having sex and he kept thrusting faster even though I told him I was feeling uncomfortable and my leg was kind of cramping. He didn't even care though, just continued doing what he was doing because he was ""too close to stop"". It's not that I wanted to stop, I just needed him to slow down and have some consideration. I wasn't even done by that point.

However, he completely ignored my words and comfort just so that he could have his orgasm. After he was finished, we argued and he snapped and said it wasn't his fault that I take so long to come. He blamed me for being too passive (a.k.a. his issue with my reluctance to leave a low-paying job - but it's complicated).

So I took a few toys and went to the bathroom to take care of my orgasm. He was in an extremely bad mood and acted like a child the whole evening just because I masturbated. He has a theory that I can't come fast enough because I'm too used to jerking off with toys. When actually, I can't finish because my boyfriend's inconsiderate and therefore awful in bed.

t2_ohuvp8q,1553701276.0,b65s6m,t3_b65s6m,4,"Hello All,

I recently wanted to fit a VHF radio to my car, however the car I have is a small city car with a tiny battery. I did not want to risk killing the car battery should I be sitting portable for any length of time. So I had the idea to use an old car battery and put a solar panel connected to charge controller &amp; fuse box mounted in the boot to run the radios from. I made a video of it if anyone wants to see the link is [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-czpUpAbcts)

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning to be able to add things to this as and when I need them, I might be sitting camped up for a while and I would like to be able to run lights and other radio equipment from it, hence the fuse box and the solar controller to protect the battery. 

To this end the solar controller is a 20Amp &amp; I am using wire rated for 20 amps running from the battery and from the solar controller to the fuse box. The radio I have plugged in only pulls a max of around 2.1Amp  when transmitting so I have plenty of room for additional devices. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have also upgraded the solar panel (the first picture is the new one) the small one mounted in the side window was only about 0.5watts. I worked out for the old car battery I am using in order to charge it properly I need a 17watt panel

the equation to work it out is pretty simple

(Battery Amp Hour)x (battery voltage) = (Watt hour)

You then work out how many hours of charging you will have, so if you want it to charge daily I worked out I have 6 hours of good day light to charge with so you then devide the watt hourage by the charging time

(watt hour) / (charging time)

&amp;#x200B;

So for my set up the numbers look like this

&amp;#x200B;

44Ahr x 12v = 528Whr

528Whr / 6 = 88Watts (this is to charge daily from compleastly flat battery

528Whr / 30 = 17.6Watts (this is what I used, this is to charge the battery weekly)

&amp;#x200B;

Also a point to note is in order to get the best out of your battery, you should not discharge it at a rate higher than its Amp hour / 10 i.e my 44Ahr battery should not be discharged at a constant current higher than 4.4Amps. It will still work doing this and it is fine for short stints but prolonged excessive draw will make the battery less efficient.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know what you are thinking, a car lead acid battery has so many downsides, Hydrogen as a byproduct, can only really supply 50% of its rated amp hours  &amp; it's not suited to being drained and charged in such a way. Well I have one thing to say to that...... You are right, it is the next thing on my list to replace.

Also its not in the pictures but the Battery has been bolted down to stop it moving around and n the event of a car crash it shouldn't become a projectile.

I am making an alarm clock/speaker thing. I have NEVER done soldering or electronics before and I am looking to ""cut a corner"".  
Firstly, I think this is not an option, but I thought I would at least find out.  


The speaker set is USB (it has a USB cable you solder on that plugs into -suprise- a USB port) but the alarm clock hs nothing. All it says is that it needs DC 3.5 - 5.5 V power. It doesn't specify battery e.t.c and it came with no battery connector or anything.  


My (questionable) idea is to crudely splice the alarm clock onto the USB cable designed to be soldered to the speaker set.  
I'm no electrician but, having covered circuits loosely at school (in physics) I know that, in parallel circuits, like this one would be, the Vlotage remains unchanged but current is shared, and thus reduced, in each part of the parallel circuit.  


Would the drop in current cause a problem or could I get away with it. (this doesn't have to be a ""long term"" thing, only for 2-3 months)

&amp;#x200B;

I had a question for those who know a lot about flooring or rugs. I'm heavy now (about 250) and I have spent a lot of time in my computer chair in a rugged room the last year or so. I didn't really think much of it because I was a lot skinnier in the past, but I think due to my weight and maybe this cheap computer chair, the floor started to get this ring around it, from the casters wheel. I uploaded a few pictures on the bottom for links just to show. It doesn't look like it frayed the rug too much, or went through the whole thing, but you can see where their was an issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was curious what people recommend? The last 2 months I've used this computer chair mat (the clear one you can get from Staples), but it seems like a piece of crap because it already indented it, and so I had to put cardboard under the clear mat as well to help the rug. Is there some kind of high quality floor mat that would help better then these cheap computer mats? Like if I bought a 60 dollar floor rug (like one you'd put under a coffee table) would that give more protection then the cardboard and Staples mat?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for any tips! I'm guessing I'll have to pay to change the rug out in this small room when I leave the apartment, but that's fine, I was just hoping I could prevent this and didn't find many good solutions on Google.

So, this was probably a playhouse at one point, and I plan to fix it up to to be a playhouse once more.

I have a budget of about $500 to make this an enjoyable, safe place for my two daughters to play. (6 and 2, currently)

My plan is to keep the existing frame of the structure intact. Build a subfloor with studs to get the first level off the ground a bit. Wall the interior of the lower level with plywood, and attempt to seal it completely to avoid wasps getting through. (I know, that's probably a stretch, this thing was full of wasps last year) I would replace the existing window and possibly add one or two more. The barn style door would be completely rebuilt. With the new sub floor, the new door would be a few inches off the ground so it won't get stuck in the grass like it is in the pictures.

Once the interior of the lower level is done, I would move on to the interior of the upper level. Replace the thin plywood floor. Replace or rebuild the door. Replace the window. Cover the inside with plywood and attempt to seal it. 

Once the inside of the upper level is done, I would strip the remaining parts of the exterior walls off, and cover with plywood. At this point (or sooner) my budget will probably be reached. Maybe down the road we can cover it with some vinyl siding. 

There will be, at the very least, a ladder or a simple staircase built to access the upper level. Potentially a rope ladder or rockwall kind of thing.

I would love to hear what you all think of my ""plan"". Thank you in advance!

I live in a bi-level home and recently noticed some  [very light water spotting in the corner of a lower level room.](https://i.imgur.com/hN7TU7y.jpg)  After inspecting the siding [outside where the water spots are located](https://i.imgur.com/uZ85TwV.jpg) , I noticed a 1 inch gap filled with some type of [sheet insulation](https://i.imgur.com/MCsWlV1.jpg)  in the 4 spaces where the siding meets the underside of our deck. 

It's clear that I need to either seal the gaps or divert the water from dripping down through the siding but I'm not sure the best way to accomplish this. If I seal the gaps, I am concerned about reducing the air flow under the siding and potentially trapping moisture - making the problem worse. 

In researching the issue, the best comparison I could find was to treat this area like you would the top of a window by installing a J channel strip and diverting the water away from the opening. Should I hire someone to take the siding off and install a J channel or would I be okay putting some backing rod and caulking the gaps?

I texted him again when I was drunk and we hooked up again and he was like I’m really glad you came over, i didn’t think you were into me, but i don’t really want to do this if I only see you when you’re not sober. So at this point I’m like okay let’s go on a date or something. We hung out on Tuesday and it went really well and he was like super affectionate. I talked to one of his friends and he was like yeah [22M] talks about you all the time. The only thing is that he’s busy most of the time with frat stuff and finding a job and so we barely text or see each other during the week. I like him, but I never know if he actually wants to see me even though he says it all the time he doesn’t really ask I feel like I’m always initiating it.

He’s very logical about everything. I feel like he lacks empathy. I’m more emotional I’m very empathetic. Anytime we get into a disagreement he ignores me. Most of the time I’m the one that reaches out to him to try and solve a relationship problem. He then acts like nothing happened the problem is past us. I always want to talk about it to try and solve the issue so it doesn’t happen again. Most of the time he gets very frustrated and ignores me so I just stopped trying to bring things up and let them go much quicker now. He used to tell me he’s never been in a relationship where he’s “fought this much” to me they aren’t fights. These are disagreements that I’m trying to solve! I’m letting him know how certain things he does make me feel. For example just today we were moving a floor jack and I noticed a nail sticking out of the handle so I immediately removed it and he spoke to me like I was an idiot. His tone changes and it makes me feel like an idiot. The way he usually does when I do something that he doesn’t approve of. It turns out the nail was in place to keep the handle from coming apart (the original bolt was missing). I just removed it because it looked like a safety hazard. That was my thinking. He said I should be more aware before I do things. I just feel that everything I do has to be up to his standards. He’s a perfectionist he has to be in control of his work and I feel like sometimes he unintentionally tries to control me. 

Just a few things he’s snapped about in the past...he was upset that I ripped a bag with our meal instead of untying it. The bag had a tight knot and I was hungry! He wanted to reuse the bag I didn’t know this until after the fact. Or when I placed his MacBook charger (while plugged into the wall) on his pile of clothes. He spoke to me like I was an idiot and said it was a dangerous place to put it. He hates how I drive and says I’m a bad driver. (My father no longer complains about my driving! He used to when I was 20) None of my friends have complained to me about my driving. 

He’s not as bad as he was before but now I just feel that I don’t want to put up with his neuroticism at all! Please tell me if I’m wrong here. 

I also feel that these are huge triggers for me because growing up my dad used to be this way not to this extreme but he just made me feel like I was an idiot for misplacing his things or getting upset with my mom when she cleaned and moved his things around. I’ve also had issues with self esteem and always wanting to major in science but always thinking I wasn’t smart enough to do it. I know my boyfriend cares about me but sometimes I feel like he’s too hard on me. I feel like he wants this perfect partner and I want someone that just understands me. 

TL;DR: Am I wrong for feeling like I don’t want to deal with his criticism and questioning our relationship or am I being too dramatic?

t2_2mg1adh,1553819459.0,b6qob5,t3_b6qob5,0,"Met this girl at a party the week after new year's. We had a mutual friend. There was an instant connection and we started hanging out and talking all the time. I would stay at her place even more than my own place because I live with my brother and it has just been more convenient for the both of us. 

She dropped hints about us not being official and I kind of shrugged them off as I just wanted to take things slow even though we were serious. As in we even did tiny things to celebrate our 2 weeks and a month. She has had friendship drama (not about me) for the past month and basically just hasn't had a steady friend group. Well, about 3 weeks ago she kind of flipped out as I brought her coffee and stopped by her place one morning. She isn't happy with her job situation and just where she is in life (a bit of a life crisis if you will) and stated that she wanted space, as in us to stop spending every night together. Which was totally fine with me because I know we both have to focus on our own stuff too and we just got carried away with always wanting to be together. I totally get that. But it's been off since. It hasn't just been distance, it's been not much affection and no sex. Even kissing feels forced. We have talked and she gives me 2 reasons: she's not happy where she is in life and just doesn't feel the same way anymore about me (but she says she doesn't want to be around anyone right now). Idk, the explanation is kind of iffy but I absolute know she isn't spending time with others. She really is just being alone with her cat mostly. And we've talked, and I told her to not lead me on and stuff, and she somewhat (maybe not at all) reassures that she is definitely into me. But she's also mentioned putting this on ice and coming back when we both figure some big things out. She says ""we are both all or nothing people, and we can't do partial, so what if you gotta let something go if you really love it for it to come back"". Basically it sounds like she wants us to have figured out everything and become our best selves separately and then come together. 

I'm rambling here because this has just got me feeling all sorts of fucked up and confused. I hate feeling needy too, but we went from 0 to 100 when we started and suddenly it is like 100 to 0. I'm giving her space. I even told her to not just call me everyday and talk about her friend drama and other stuff because I can't just be emotionally available for her when she isn't reciprocating and kind of setting me aside in a way.

I'm not sure what to do. I want to give her the space she needs to figure her life out, but I absolutely do not want to take a break. I don't believe in that because if you really do like someone, I feel like you can at least slow it down and we can have like a date night on the weekend or something. Also, conditions will never be perfect. Yes we should love ourselves first before being in something, but we can also help each other grow and support each other, on a big level or even a small one (such as spending our time doing absolutely productive and healthy things together).

If I could just get any advice on how to approach this it would be greatly appreciated. Do I respect her wishes and accept that there is no guarantee that we will even spend any time together this weekend (she conveniently is working every single night even though she usually checked with me prior to saying okay to night shifts because we spent our time together), or do I force the issue and tell her that I'm really into her and that we can definitely scale it back but that I still want to be romantically dating her? Sorry for being a bit incoherent, but thank you for taking the time to read this! 

tl;dr: This girl I'm dating became suddenly distant because she is having a bit of a life crisis and feels like she is losing herself a little. We had something really good going and it has kind of stalled on top of almost going to just being friends. What do I do?

t2_3i0862w1,1553819324.0,b6qngw,t3_b6qngw,0,"Hey all,

I am quite damn confused at the moment, and thinking it may be better to write this all out and get a outside perspective on this.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially I met her just under a year ago at a Meetup, and we quickly hit it off as great friends.  So much so after hanging out with her a few times just me and her I asked her out after a film, she said would just like to be friends.

&amp;#x200B;

We kept hanging out and I did the whole ignore feelings, and they did leave once or twice, but came back in force, especially as it is pretty usual to hang out 3 to 4 times a week together, just us or occasionally with friends.

We even went overseas together on a overseas holiday to two different locations for a combined 5 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

After getting back from the overseas trip, the feelings really came back and I started to build the courage and started to hint that I was interested to test the waters.  She however was getting slightly homesick.

&amp;#x200B;

She booked flights home for May a couple of weeks back, I was bummed as I found out the day I was going to ask her, so put that on hold.

&amp;#x200B;

We went out on Wednesday, had a great time and started talking about I am going to miss her, she bought up at that time that she now likes me, but doesn't want to lose me as a friend.  I was ecstatic and said lets just see how things go over the next month and can work out the details.  She had mentioned she could come back after a month or so after being home, and I have plenty of leave, and a risk of redundancy at work so have been planning next steps.  Had actually spoken to my folks last month about moving to my birth town and where she is from for work (I have a passport there as-well)

&amp;#x200B;

As I was leaving her at the train station, we hugged, she then stopped me and kissed me, so yeah, left on a high note, and planned to go out on Friday to see a Comedy Show, Dinner and Dessert at our favourite place.

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday after work she messages me, going I made a mistake and don't want to ruin the friendship and best if we just stay friends.  I ask if we can speak about it, she calls a couple of hours later and mentions shes not 100% sure what she wants and she needs to be 100% sure, that she isn't sure how it would work, and can we just go back to being best friends (she says this multiple times throughout the call).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty hurt, but stay level headed the entire call, I say how much she means to me and tell her the extent of my feelings and was actually working up to asking her out that day, and the day when she mentioned her flights.    She wouldn't budge on just going back to being best friends, and sounded very confused about all the variables in her life and not being 100% sure.

&amp;#x200B;

I wished her the best for her remaining time here, she said she couldn't enjoy it without me.  I apologised, but don't feel at this time I could be friends without hurting myself (although today I have quite a urge to just start hanging out again, miss her tons and don't want to ruin the last month of her being here in a fight, as I really enjoy our time together as-well).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently thinking of just biting the bullet and enjoying all the things we did have booked together and suck it up hoping I can cope, just because I miss her so much - and if at the end of it all, when she leaves in a month and I still have feelings, just saying hope she comes back.

&amp;#x200B;

Just worried about thinking with emotions, and pretty lost, even after typing it all out.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Best friend asks me out, I've had feelings for a while, gets unsure the day after and says friends only.  Very upset when I say I don't think I can do that.  She flies home in a month to see family, but possibility of coming back, and I was already thinking of moving to birthtown (where she is from) to work after job gone, so no issue with distance.",relationships,My (M30) best friend (F29) mentioned she liked me (I was over the moon) then rescinded it a day later

So my first real boyfriend [20 M] and I have been dating about 6 months and so much has been absolutely amazing we have great chemistry, can talk for hours and have had so many adventures together, I've never loved anyone like I love him.
 
However, now that the rose colored glasses are starting to slip off I'm starting to see some red flags that think I just didnt want to see sooner and need some outside advice to see if these are actual red flags or me just being inexperienced and overly concerned. 

Firstly I'm in college, he isnt, this didn't worry me in the beginning, college isnt for everyone you know, but then he's changed career paths 3 times in the 6 months we've been together and I understand figuring out what you want to do with your life is incredibly hard but its worrying that all of his plans he eventually scraps. Right now he's working at a moderately paying sports store and still lives at home so he can save money instead of paying rent, which I understand I live at home too in the summer. 

It worries me though, two months ago he was dead set on applying to college, that didnt pan out because he says he didnt get enough financial aid but I suspect it's just bc he got frustrated with the application process. Two months before that he wanted to go to a trade school that obviously didnt happen either. Idk if I should be worried, whenever i talk to him about this he always seems so confident that everything's going to work out my worries go away but right now his only plan is saving money, idk how to feel about that.

Worry #2 he's messy, I understand that hes a busy person who has to work but when I came over today he had dirty dishes and chips on his floor, to be fair it was only a couple hours notice but he could have easily picked up a little, I'm not perfect at cleaning either but a little effort would be nice

Worry #3 He was far from a virgin when I met him, I dont know exactly how many other girls hes been with but I know the number is pretty high. However I'm his first real relationship too, the others were generally short flings and we went to school together so I know that's true. He was my first though so I think that has to do a little about why I'm sensitive about this, I know I shouldnt be but when everything is a first for me and not him it makes me a little jealous and I dont mean to be I know it's not fair but it still makes me anxious sometimes.

Worry #4 we really only hang out once or twice a week, it's hard because I go to college about an hour away and he works so during the week we're usually unable to see each other, idk if this less than usual but I wish we could see each other more and it's usually up to me to drive back from college and I kinda get it, i have a roomate and everything is pretty expensive on campus but it would make me feel more secure if he made more of an effort to see me instead of the other way around you know. Idk I think this one might just be circumstantial but theres still that little voice

Please don’t tell me to leave her or similar advice because I don’t want to even consider that or tell me that high school relationships won’t last because we are strong and that’s why I am writing this to get even stronger. If anyone had similar problems and advice on how they coped with it It would mean a great deal to me. It will help me be happy and confident in my relationship.

TL;DR: need advice to be confident and trusting, strategies to be more secure in my relationship, and not get jealous

Ex \[m24\] of 6 months broke up with me \[f28\] last saturday out of the blue. I suspected something was going on but never something that would lead to a drastic outcome like this. Just last month he had told me he loved me. Days after saying it he had an appendicitis and I welcomed him into my home for recovery and drove him to all his appointments. A week later he went to stay at his grandmother's and then went back to work. This is when things started to get shady. He went from being a guy who would text me everyday even just to say hi to barely texting. Whenever I would reach out to see if he was ok he would be very short and distant and then started flaking on me. He would make plans then leave me hanging, no text no nothing to say plans changed. I started to worry something was wrong and questioning if maybe I had done or said something wrong. When I left for the weekend with my friends; I never heard back from him after he had texted me the day before to ask me if i wanted to hang out. I opened IG and saw he posted a selfie, which was so out of character. Since meeting him, he had no interest in social media so it seemed off that he would start now. It made me feel upset because he didn't have time to tell me plans were cancelled but has time to post a selfie?

I called him out on it and was hoping to discuss things with him, but when i texted him that was when he decided to drop the bomb that he was going out to sea and would be back in a week. Normally he would always be on top of things like that and let me know ahead of time but I felt like if I wouldn't have texted him he wouldn't have let me know.

When he returned he messaged me saying he missed me and would text me asking what I was up to. He planned a date for us this past saturday and I was so excited to see him since it had been a month since we physically saw each other. I got dolled up, he picked me up, met my mother for the first time, and took me out for coffee. In the car he joked about future plans with me and everything seemed great. However at the coffee shop that was when he decided to tell me he wanted to break up because he felt guilty. Guilty that he couldn't dedicate enough attention to me and that he's not sure he can keep up a relationship because of the navy schedule and his upcoming deployment in January 2020. Since we met, I knew this wouldn't be a normal relationship. I always tried my best to never pressure him for more than what he could give, be it time wise or relationship wise.

I'm so confused. I understand not feeling like you can balance both but it really made me feel like I was played. How does a person go from I love you last month to sorry I can't commit to you because XYZ is coming up and I have to stop and put gas on wednesdays, and tie my shoes in november. It seems like such a BS excuse to me.

What's worse is that we had sex right after (stupidity on my end) and continued to text the rest of the weekend and he said he wants me in his life and his last text to me said he missed me and something about take backs which I'm not sure was a joke or not. I told him I wouldn't settle for less than gf and if he can't handle a relationship with me then how can he handle a friendship. There is no point especially because his schedule will never change, it will always be demanding and life will always pile on things. Finding balance is part of adulthood.

I can't decipher if he is being sincere and his reason for the breakup is genuine and if I am being selfish for not wanting to let this end. Especially when he had told me that same day in the car he saw the a future with me. He was the one that chased me for months and asked me to be his gf so I'm so confused what's changed all of a sudden?

I've gone no contact and it's only day 3 since we last talked, but i'm in so much pain and confused about what the hell just happened. I'm also worried I may possibly be pregnant since I was ovulating at the time according to my calendar.

Am I being selfish for firmly believing that if you truly love someone you tackle obstacles together and refusing to believe his excuse and refusing to stay by his side as a friend? Should I be supportive of his decision to focus on his career and not doubt that there was other reasons for his guilt?

**TL;DR**: Ex broke up with me because he says he can't handle the upcoming changes in his navy schedule and a relationship. Texts me the following day to say he wants me in his life and misses me. I'm confused whether to believe his excuse or believe that it's because of something shady because his demeanor changed after telling me he loved me and after having surgery last month. I've gone NC and freaking out i may be pregnant on top of all the emotions and question if am wrong not to agree to a friendship or for firmly believing that if you truly love someone you tackle obstacles together? Should I be supportive of his decision to focus on his career and not doubt that there was other reasons for his guilt?",relationships,Am I being irrational and selfish

This went great for about 40 days and then \*all of a sudden\* in a matter of hours he decides I am not good for him and he started to repel me. I tried to fix things but post that he showed willingness only for sex and said didnt have time for a relationship anymore.

t2_86njf4m,1553796011.0,b6m289,t3_b6m289,2,"There is this guy who I have never really liked, but tolerated. He is generally socially akward and tried to be my friend for 3 years, most of which I spent flaking out on things he invites me to and pretending I didn't get his phone calls. He also occasionally said dumb stuff I just couldn't ignore, like brining in a picture of a parrot to hold up whenever I laughed ""because my laugh sounds like a parrot"" and talking about his shower habits unprompted and out of context.

Flash forward to about a month ago. I learn that a mutual friend hasn't had as many changes luck ignoring him as I had in the past few months and it turns out he has been borderline harassing her. It's obvious he likes her as well and also she's my romantic interest but that's not what this is about.  Anyway me and a friend decided to confront him about it. Here is what he did for context:
-Stalking
-Awkwardness in journalism
-constant requests to meet in person
-weird compliments
-apalogized for thinking she was fragile???? Which he had never told her he thought up until the apology in the first place???
- said  you’re number 3 smartest  person I know so I want to get a better friendship with you (also she is Uber self conscious about grades and was disappointed she got third smartest freshman in the school officially so that was a close to home blow
-oblivious to any social signals
- he also asked what clubs she was in specificly to join those clubs 
- he gave her a panic attack by coming to one of said clubs.


Finally the day of the confrontation rolled around and I was the one who told him to meet my friend and I after school to talk. I couldn't come and bailed at the last second because of ride home shenanigans. It went as expected apparently, with him mostly deflecting and he agreed to stop bothering her, however maintaining it wasn't his fault. Later, he called me. He was mad and talking about how he felt betrayed. Everything he said could be condensed to a few main points:
How could you do this to me?
-You are weak for not telling me to f*** off from the get go
-I did nothing wrong
Then the kicker: 
- you - unlike your friends (the one who confronted him and the girl) have no disorders to hide behind why didn't you tell me you didn't like me??? 
The called ended with me telling him I want nothing to do with him anymore, and for a while he respected that. Untill track rolls around. Luckily he is a distance runner and the distance and sprinters are pretty separate but still. He thinks we are friends again? Pretty soon after he joined he asked if I wanted us to just ignore each other. I said yes. He gave a bit of a non apology saying he hadn't meant to hurt anyone but not actually saying sorry. 

Recently he has started getting friendly again. I don't know what he thinks changed but he is attempting to be my friend. I couldn't care less if he is on the team I just want this man to stop trying to associate with me. What is a good way for me to tell him I hate him?

t2_1z2kqvv9,1553817289.0,b6qadu,t3_b6qadu,18,"Hey there redditors!

So, I have a doubt that has been running around my mind since I graduated from high school.

First off, let me clarify one thing, I have a girlfriend and we've been together for more than 4 years and I love her with all my heart, and I am super happy with her on my side.

Now that I moved that out of the way, the story goes off like this (I'm gonna try to be as brief as possible here)

So I met my highschool crush (let's call her X due to a lack of imagination) when I was  15 (now I am 21) and when I met her we had 2 years left before we graduated.

Alright so basically she was in all of my classes and so I just fell in love with her but I never really acted on those feelings because I was kinda shy (now that is not the case) but yeah, anytime I had the chance to make a move I would basically screw everything up, like one time we were walking on the street heading home and she said she was cold and I had my jacket in my hand I replied ""yeah I know right?"" And I never gave her the jacket or whatever lol. 
Opportunities like this came a lot of times because we would always head out to the same direction when we were going home after school.

We were never really close buuuut we talked a bunch of times, we were friends on Facebook, followed each other on Twitter and stuff like that.

One day I was like ""ah screw it"" and I declared my feelings towards her on FACEBOOK LOL so yeah that happened and she was pretty shocked because she never saw it coming, but she basically replied ""sorry but I'm not interested"" and I accepted it and moved on.

The thing is that after I declared my feelings she was acting weird, like one time she was pointing to her cheek kinda like saying ""hey aren't you going to say hi and kiss me? (On the cheek of course) and because I still liked her I went ahead and kissed her on the cheek lol.

But yeah fast forward I met my current girlfriend in my last year of high school (she was from another school) and X would ask me things about her like what was her name, her last name (because apparently she wanted to know if she met her before from the school my gf went to) and stuff like that which was kinda weird because I was like ""didn't she give a crap about me? Why would she care about my gf so much?"" 

Fast forward a couple of months later a party went down and X was there, she was a bit drunk that night, and she would ask me how did she look from a scale from 1 to 10 and stuff like that and she even said to one of her friends to stay away because she wanted to make out with me! And I was shocked (I was already in a relationship with my current gf so I was never going to cheat on her) but next day at school I never asked X about that.

So yeah now a couple of years later I just have a lot of curiosity about wether or not she had feelings for me back then in high school after she wanted to kiss me on that party and stuff like that.




I'm not interested in asking her out or anything like that because as I said before I have a girlfriend and I would never want to leave her, I even asked her what did she think about me messaging X and stuff and she was okay with it because she felt like it's a normal thing that guys have from their high school days, ha! 

This ""need"" to ask her what she thought of me usually reappears when I dream about her (which happens a few times a year) and in those dreams we just hang around for a while (small talk), then I just wake up and I have the doubt floating my mind for a little while of ""What did she think of me back in high school?...) until it's gone again. 



TL;DR: Is it weird if after almost 5  years of never seeing or speaking to each other I ask my high school crush via DM or something if she ever had a thing for me or should I just leave it and have the doubt forever? (A little bit exaggerated huh lol)

t2_g6fe4,1553816983.0,b6q8br,t3_b6q8br,1,"So me and my bf have been having problems. These problems essential come down to me not really feeling that he understands me and my emotions, largely because he is very defensive. He says - and I believe him - that he does value my welfare highly and he is upset that I haven't been able to feel it, but often when there is conflict I will feel that the problem hasn't been resolved (due to the defensiveness) and then he gets frustrated because he can tell I'm waiting to hear something and he doesn't understand what I need. I'm awful at thinking on my feet and can never think of how to word it in the moment, so it ends up going something like this:

ME: Would you mind thinking of something we can do this weekend? It's just I've organised all of our dates so far.

HIM: But I'm just not like that; I don't think of doing these things.

ME: Ok, I guess it's just that it can feel like I'm putting more work into the relationship and it's nice to be invited out now and then.

HIM: \*silence\* - why are you looking at me like that? What do you need?

ME: Erm...

He **will** later act on the thing if I've been clear about it (like organising a date), and I appreciate that, but when every conversation about an unmet need I have is like this I end up feeling drained anyway. It's kind of like being the 'adult' in the relationship. I believe that the frustration over 'what do you need' is a genuine confusion from his part. He doesn't validate his own emotions either. And I'm concerned that over time he's taking it a bit like he's 'failing' or he's 'not good enough' because there are times he is unintentionally upsetting me and he's feeling blamed (even if I'm not accusing him of anything). He gets upset too, of course, but those conversations always pass quickly because I don't feel blamed. Because conversations about my needs end up being so drawn out, it can make me feel like I'm somehow being more demanding, but when I look back at it, it's just that meeting his needs takes less time.

Anyway, because I'm so awful at explaining this in the moment, I considered writing him a letter that explains it with an example of what emotional validation looks like - being clear that the reason I'm doing that is because he feels frustrated not knowing what it is I'm looking for, and so that we can avoid more stress in the future. Something like:

""I'm sorry that you've felt the relationship had become one-sided with you organising all our dates. I hadn't noticed this had been happening and I certainly didn't intend it, but I know it feels shit because I've had the same experience in the past with my friends (true).""

We've already spoken about his defensiveness, which he says is a kneejerk reaction that he can't help (I think that's true for a lot of people), and I've said that the defensiveness itself would be something I could live with if afterwards when he's calmed down he would approach me to discuss the issue properly, but I don't feel like that's happening because he seems genuinely confused about how to do that.

I guess my hesitation at this point, though, is that I feel like I'm just patronising him now. He wants to work on the relationship - we nearly broke up over this recently because I just felt really unsupported - and that's what's making me think I should give him a fighting chance by explaining it as clearly as possible. But I guess it just feels weird because to me it's such a 'simple' thing that I feel like I'm talking down to him just by explaining it. There were issues from my side as well, which I have identified and gone to him with to apologise - saying something much like what I said above with relation to things I could do better. Do you think it's a bit patronising to explain it?

(Also, I'm aware my way of speaking is probably a bit cloying and meek and that probably doesn't help - I can't currently think of how to change that, though. I'm not a shouter, never have been, and I find it very difficult to express emotion during conflict (as does he) so they end up being these mildly insipid talks because neither of us can really raise our voices or act with spontaneous emotion, it just doesn't come naturally to us. He is more reactive than I am - as above - but he's not shouting or flying off the handle or anything. But yeah ... I'm aware I come across like an assertiveness manual and I honestly just don't know how to change that right now ... )

So apologies in advance if you’ve seen my many posts about my bf. I deleted them because I think he comes on here...

In the past month, my bf has canceled 3 dates, left for a weekend during our standing date, hasn’t been verbally affectionate- basically has been talking and texting like I’m just a friend, although when we are together he’s very affectionate... I’ve seen him probably 4 times the past month. He has apologized for being distant a few weeks back saying he has been stressed out. Yesterday, when he canceled our date last night, he said he hardly has time anymore. After the cancellation, he didn’t even bother suggesting another day to see each other, and in the past, he has. So I’m taking this as he has checked out and the relationship is over, or has been for a while. I mentioned in the text that this has felt one sided and he no longer suggests days. He counteracted saying he was going to suggest such and such day, but has a lot of chores backed up (knowing damn well I will have my kids that day, so it was just a tactic to get me to believe he’s putting forth some effort). I responded saying I have my kids until x day, hoping that he will reply asking to do something on that day- which is a day we both have free anyway and he knows this. But he never replied.

Fast forward to today. Since he’s at work, instead of calling him, I texted asking if he had a few minutes during his lunch hour to call me. I did this because I’m aware that our custodial arrangements likely won’t allow a phone conversation until after the weekend. 4 hours pass and I hear absolutely nothing. No phone call, not even a text. Does 6 months together not warrant that type of conversation given it’s been a relatively short amount of time? I just wanted to ask him where we stand, if he wants me to leave him alone just to tell me. I would never just disappear on anyone. He’s a 36 year old man with children so I didn’t expect him to do this.

I wonder if it’s safe to assume this relationship is over without being mentioned. And I wonder if he’s just avoiding and feeling pressured so he is ignoring me and perhaps will be in touch sooner or later. Or being a coward and ghosting me altogether? Thoughts?

Tl;dr: Bf has been distant. I told him how I felt yesterday over text. The cut the conversation short and I reached out earlier to have a conversation and he has ignored that. Does it sound like he’s ghosting?

I dont want to go out with her anymore. Every time she gets upset that men are more interested in me. I brush off advances because I'm in a relationship. She constantly gets mad at me once shes been drinking saying ""you're friends with me to make yourself look prettier"", ""I dont know why guys give you some much attention"", ""I dont get why they think you're pretty."", etc. Or if a guy does compliment me to her... ""He said you were attractive.... oh also that you seem like a huge bitch."" 


It seems like she tells me awful things a lot that dont need to be said. Please keep in mind that I do try my best to make her feel good about herself. I always compliment her hair/makeup/style on a daily basis, tell her how pretty she looks, encourage her dreams to do music publically or sell her DIY jewelry (shes great at both) or try to be a wingman when we go out together, so I dont know why she is so harsh in return.

 If shes talking to a guy and I comment on something trying to add to the conversation, she runs away from us making him chase her or pretends to be disinterested in something I say. When we're alone I make her laugh but around other guys, she acts like anything humorous I say is annoying and not funny... 

She constantly belittles my accomplishments. But other the other hand she is nice and funny, we have fun conversations and a great time together- when we're not around single men. 

I want to continue a friendship with her, I've dropped subtle hints for her to see a therapist, that it would help, but she doesnt care. My boyfriend (24 M) has started to refuse trips/events/etc. If shes going because he doesn't like the way she needs to be the focal point and the way she makes things about herself or is rude to me.

Me and my boyfriend of 4,5 years broke up on the 5th of this month. We were in a long distance relationship with a 9 hour time difference. The relationship started in 2014, but the long distance started in July 2018. He’s coming home in April (2019).

We broke it off because he was a really bad long distance boyfriend. We only talked one hour on the phone once a week if I was lucky. During the winter holidays he didn’t call me for 3 weeks, even though he had told me he would have more time than usual to talk then. 

As I said, he’s coming home this April. But some weeks before the break up, he told me that he wanted to either move back abroad to work, or move to a city 3 hours away from me. I couldn’t take it. The though of a continued LDR (long distance relationship) without an end date killed me. We tried to talk it out, because neither of us wanted to end it. There was a lot of crying from both of us. He wasn’t very cooperative. Neither of us was happy with how the relationship was, and I told him (as many many times before) what I would need to “survive” another LDR. He told me that “Sure I can try, but don’t expect me to be able to talk/text more”. I asked him what he wanted/needed from me, and he just said “I don’t know”. He’s always been a really bad communicator, even when we lived in the same city. He’s not very good with conflict, he closes himself off and doesn’t really want to talk about it. That attitude can work in a regular relationship, it can still work out, but not in a LDR....

The question:
We broke it off because the circumstances wasn’t working for us. But I miss him so dearly. It’s been 3 weeks with the only contact being me congratulating him on his graduation (the very thing he moved away to do. He answered “Thank you, it means a lot!” And nothing more). 

I cry almost every day, and I just want him back. Not the LDR relationship him that never put me first, the him that left me last summer to pursue his dreams. 

I feel like shit, but it hasn’t been a very long time since the breakup, how will I know if I’ll grow to regret this decision? Should I reach out to him to try again when he gets home? Even if that possibly means starting a LDR again?

&amp;#x200B;

A few nights ago, I did something he's repeatedly asked me not to do (put a pinch of tobacco in one corner of the bowl of our bong. I like it that way, he doesn't).

&amp;#x200B;

He saw and started up immediately, saying nobody in his life listens to him and I'm a liar. Fair. I did say I wouldn't do this. And I did it. But I reached out to pause the TV since we're watching a show and I know we'll both regret letting it run later when we forget where we left off. When I got the remote in my hand off the tray on the couch, he grabbed the center of my forearm. He still claims he was aiming for the remote but 1- so what, it would still be bad to grab the remote from me and 2- he's an adult wearing glasses and sitting two feet from me, so wherever he's aiming, he should be able to get.

&amp;#x200B;

The ensuing argument gave me a panic attack - I stood in the kitchen dissociating for a few minutes then went to the bedroom to get my meds. He got angry that I passed by him ""shivering like a holocaust victim"" and said my panic attacks are ""a royal get out of jail free card that make me untouchable and absolve my actions"".

&amp;#x200B;

He didn't apologize for grabbing me for half an hour or so into the fight, and didn't stop yelling until I was curled up crying. He also believed that my yelling at him to leave me alone was the same as me calling the police and telling them he assaulted me, that the neighbors were dialing right now, and he was getting out of here. He put on his coat and shoes, grabbed his keys, but ended up taking them off and sitting on the floor with me eventually asking me why I lied and saying that's what got him so upset.

&amp;#x200B;

We kept going back and forth another hour or so, I don't remember how we finished but he admitted that he never should have grabbed me even though it was an accident and that he couldn't explain why but that he would never hit me. (My therapist thinks he'd hit me in the moment one day if he doesn't get help)

&amp;#x200B;

How can I talk to him about this without drawing more ire? He was doing better when he was briefly in therapy but then the doctor literally ghosted him.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling super weird, and he's picking up that vibe. His sister just had a baby and we have all sorts of stressful ""couple things"" coming up and I'd rather be a support to him than to punish him, but I also have to think about myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit : I apologized sincerely for putting the tobacco in the bowl, multiple times, but in situations like these he considers it ""damage done"".

t2_m0cdc,1553815236.0,b6pwr5,t3_b6pwr5,7,"I start by apologizing for my far from perfect English and writing flow, but English is not my native tongue.

I come from two long running relationships, which definitely took their toll on me, and for a while I didn't want to be with another girl and rather focus on my career and passions.

I managed to get a nice job as full stack software developer (my passion is informatics and technology) in a firm 3 minutes from where I live, basically my dream job.

After some time, I met this girl at a dinner with friends, and we started dating shortly after that evening. We have now been dating for more or less one year and a half, with many bumps down the road. Long story short, after a fiery start, things got a little colder and I started noticing some things that I didn't like.

1. We have common interests and agree on almost nothing. I like many things, have a lot of hobbies, watch every movie genre. And yet I cannot watch even one movie with her because she only likes titanic and a few other movies. She can't finish even one episode of a tv series before getting bored and watching IG on her phone. Basically, we have no couch-time together, which I really dig… you know, the good ol' Netflix and chill.
2. She has joyful/enthusiasm spikes and, shortly after, sad/depression spikes. Constantly. I am quite easy going, and have a hard time dealing with these 180° most of the time.
3. Sex has been far from great, she’s shy and doesn’t really get into action.

But nonetheless, I decided to put up with these issues and differences and try to deal with them since not all the people can share common interest but get together well eventually.

5 months ago, she moved from the city where I live to a bigger city \~70 miles away, due to a new job, and we get to see each other in the weekends.

Now, I bit of backstory: I worked in that city before landing my dream job and those were some of the darkest time of my life. As a result, I absolutely loathe that city, while - obviously, see point 1 - she loves it, because is the city of fashion and shining lights and cars, while I live in a &gt;100K people city with not much fun and nightlife. Being the simple-life-lover that I am, I bought my first house in my little city planning to live here.

The real problems begin in the moment where she wants ME to have a better job (which, I assure you, is not a bad job) and move to her city, or a city in between the two. I have been working for 8 years, while she is at her first working experience. I have an open-ended contract with many career possibility, she is currently an intern.

I don't want to lose my solid job position, and I don't want to leave my city, but now It has come to the point where we fight over the phone because I don't want to go in her city in the weekend and I should get a better payed job in her city (which in turn would cost me a lot in terms of rent and/or commuting). Meanwhile, I can't say anything about her job or her returning to our city, or she gets mad at me. 

I feel we have come to the point where It's either me or her, and I'm thinking of breaking up.

Every time I think of breaking up with her I feel relieved, but at the same time afraid of not getting to know new girls since at this age it becomes more and more difficult to meet new people, and I deeply fear a life of loneliness or getting too old to have kids or start a family.

I am really at a fork in the road, and I need some advice on which direction to take. Open to any kind of advice.

t2_3ajvil6f,1553814422.0,b6pr8t,t3_b6pr8t,7,"Hi so recently I’ve been unsure on how to react to a few things going on in my relationship with my girlfriend. We met on tinder and have been going out for nearly 2 years. Everything’s great for the most part. We love each other, have a good sex life, spend time with our friends and family together. We click. 

However recently I have 2 things that have come up.
We were supposed to grab lunch tomorrow at a good restaurant near her work and she ended up cancelling on me saying she wanted to get more work done that day. No problem. Except I just found out (through shear chance) that she ended up going to that restaurant for lunch today instead. I think she just went with work friends but I don’t understand why she wouldn’t tell me. I asked her after what she had for lunch and she lied. I don’t know why she would have to lie but she did. Its not a big deal, maybe she didn’t want to make me feel bad? I’m a little confused by her actions, and wondering if its worth mentioning.

Secondly, early in our relationship she was always concerned about me liking other girls pictures on instagram when I swore to her they were just friends, I also followed an exgirlfriend or 2 and she called me out on it. I admitted i was wrong and i unfollowed my exes and stopped liking a lot of other girls pictures. 

Fast forward a month later, I find out shes following majority of her exes and a lot of dudes she dated in the past, After looking into it even more, I noticed she was liking a lot of these guys pictures during the same time she was calling me out. I called her out on being a hypocrite and she admitted she was wrong. Thing is the girls photos i was liking I never had a sexual relationship with, where as the pictures she were liking were of guys she has slept with in the past. She was trying to reason with me that they are just her friends now and that she doesn’t talk to them often but she will like their photos on occasion with no ill intention.

What do you guys think? Should I just turn my head and continue doing my thing, or should i have a serious conversation about how she shouldn’t be liking peoples photos whos she slept with in the past. I feel like i am a little jealous, but at the same time don’t want to be controlling. Essentially I’m asking where should i draw the line?

Besides from those things, our relationship is great.. so not sure if these things are worth bringing up if everything else is good.

Thanks for those who made it this far, would really appreciate some advice!

Relationship of 2 years going strong
2 concerns-

1. white lies - gf wanted to grab lunch near her work
Planned to meet up tomorrow
She ends up cancelling because shes busy that day
Find out she went to that restarant today instead
I’d be okay if she just told me, instead tells me she brought lunch to work
I know she lied

Worth saying something or give her pass? reason why i know is because she shares location with me 

2. social media etiquette while in relationships

Gf insecure about me liking girls photos/ following exes on instagram year into relationship

I admitted i was wrong and unfollowed/ stopped liking pics

Month later, find out she has been liking dudes photos of guys shes met on bumble/ tinder, past flings/ guys shes dated. 

I called her out and she unfollowed them 

she still likes guys pics though and follows some of them

She thinks they are equivalent to me liking pics of rando girls

When she slept with these guys, I didnt sleep with these girls

t2_2hb14ioa,1553814414.0,b6pr79,t3_b6pr79,7,"I (29m) recently started dating a girl (26f).

I struggle with relationship anxiety based on unfaithfulness and cheating. Thankfully I've been seeing a therapist for years and have developed coping techniques. But I'm not sure how to accept a lie told that potentially sets me up to be double-crossed in a more serious manner.

The dishonesty was from my girlfriend. She told me she hadn't left work yet, and told me to meet her at her apartment 1.5 hours later. Since traffic was rough and I was already Ubering close to her place, I headed to a taco joint near her apt.

The only way for me to hit the joint was to pass her place, and the only way for her to beat me home would've been to pass me on the one route in that direction. 19 minutes after she told me she was going to be at work ""a bit longer,"" she was already home. But it's easily a 25 minute drive.

I'm nervous that she lied so she could have a different person over to sleep with. But I'm trying to convince myself that it's because she wanted alone time, and perhaps because of my anxiety being so prominent, she lied so that I wouldn't worry about what she was doing. Anyhow, she's vehemently denied it all. It's an absolute certainty though.

Thoughts? It's an absolute certainty that she was dishonest. I need help breaking down where to go from here.

Should I [20F] pay my roommate  [24F]  for shared essential items 

Recently I've [20F] moved in with my bf [21M] and another couple[24F+21M]. The other couple picked the apartment, got everything situated, brought furniture, Appliances, cleaning supplies, toilet paper, food, etc. Then me and my bf moved in. We even went on a airbnb for valentine's day. They probably  altogether spent $1000 or $1500 on it if I had to guess give or take. 
my boyfriend and I pay them for bills each month utilities, electric, cable, rent. We don't share food but we share everything else. 

I feel guilty and it's weighing on my conscious a lot. I DO NOT like oweing people anything. It makes me extremely uncomfortable. I texted my roommates saying I'd like to pay them back for anything but they did not respond at all. They keep to themselves a lot and me and my bf keep to ourselves as well . My bf said not to pay them back for it because they choose to buy the things. And when we do move out me and my bf are not taking any of that shared items with us. Everytime I look at the pan were cooking in or using the broom I feel so conflicted using things I did not pay for. But I just hate thinking this is something that could be held over my head something as simple as money. 
Should I pay them back or just leave it alone?  Whatever decision I make I'm sticking to it I can't keep feeling this way.

So my husband and I live together and have been together a few years. The past year or so, sex has been awful (it was great before). He usually can't get off, goes soft every few minutes, etc. He also doesn't seem to enjoy it. There wasn't any issue before this. He's also stopped initiating and has started turning me down. My first thought was it was something medical, but it's been confirmed not to be. Now, he's got multiple terabytes of porn stashed on his PC with all different types of fetishes. Some fetishes are things that aren't even possible. I've never had an issue with this, but catching someone masterbating a couple times a day when you are feeling sex (and intimacy) starved, really sucks. And as it turns out, he's masturbating 3 times a day. Sometimes these sessions last an hour or more. He maintains that he is still physically attracted to me (and my body hasn't changed during this at all) but he's often choosing porn and his hand over me. I'm beginning to feel like there's not really a relationship because there's zero intimacy at this point. Heck, I can't even get him to go out and do fun stuff with me on the weekends. I've talked with him a few times, asking how I can make sex better for him or what I can do in general, but the conversations never go anywhere. He's even acknowledged that porn and excessive masterbation is causes issues when it comes to real sex, and then he'll tell me he's stopped but the next day I will walk in and theirs porn playing. At this point it's seriously affecting his sleep as well because he will wake up an hour early for session 1 (at 3am), and then try and stay up later than me (until about 11pm when I go to bed as my work schedule is delayed). He does his best to hide it every time I walk in the room. I'd say 70% of the time I walk in the living room he's going at it. I feel like I'm not even allowed out there anymore.

Overall I'm at a huge loss as to what to do. At this point I don't know how much longer I can handle this until I need to move on. I'm not totally sure how to approach this conversation that needs to happen without sounding accusing and shaming.

TL;DR Does he have a masterbation addiction? How to navigate the conversation about it?

t2_24p3kuc1,1553792391.0,b6lbjx,t3_b6lbjx,3,"My boyfriend has had a semi-rapid decline in his mental health for the past 4 months or so. Its gotten to the point where he’s had to turn down a very well paying gig because he’s so burnt out. He’s also losing weight at an alarming pace, from 175 to 159 in just 3 months, while trying to GAIN weight. He’s just started therapy and is going to an internist soon. I know he’s doing everything he can think of to try and improve his health. 

Up until recently, I was in good health and my own mental illness was being treated semi-successfully with medication and EMDR/somatic psychotherapy. I have PTSD from an accident, and I’m in the process of being diagnosed with some sort of autoimmune illness, which has been getting progressively worse. I used to be in a place where I could help my SO with his stress, but I just can’t anymore. My doctors have told me that unless I seriously start managing and decreasing my stress levels, I will continue to decline in health. 

So I wold love some ideas on how I can be supportive of him while not increasing my stress levels at all. At the moment, I do the majority of the domestic duties in our apartment. He’s gotten better about not giving me a shitty attitude when I ask him for help cleaning, but I still can’t handle taking care of both of us. I do all of the cooking as well, which is getting more and more challenging because of how hard it is for me to do so much cleaning. I have chronic pain, so doing things like carrying laundry or taking the trash to the dumpster are really hard for me. I’ve been taking my laundry to my car and driving it to the laundry room in our apartment complex because I can’t manage to carry it all the way there and back anymore. (Which is emotionally devastating because I work in the fitness industry, and I’m currently incapable of exercising to the degree that I would like to). 

Because of the autoimmune issue, I have to eat in a very specific way, and everything has to be cooked at home. I can’t manage the amount of cleaning that cooking for two people creates. I ended up pushing myself too far, and now I have to take time off of work, too. I’ve been in treatment for my issues for three years, and I’m constantly trying to find new methods and modalities of managing my issues. Which ends up being very expensive. Which leads me to my next point: we live in one of the most expensive cities in the world. I hate living here, and I would move in a heartbeat if he didn’t HAVE to work here. He also hates living here and would move if it was possible. 

So I’m wondering if anyone has any advice on how I can manage this stress better. I feel like there’s a mountain of stress on my shoulders, and I’m being buried alive by it. I would love to know if anyone who also has autoimmune issues or chronic pain has any advice.

I would assume I would use stair nose along the ledge, but wouldn’t that require it to be fastened down and prevent that edge from floating and allowing for thermal expansion?

We have a very high water table where we are so our sump pump runs quite often after a good rain. Right now it is discharging from the side of the house and running down the driveway to the street. Hence the one sude wearing down more.

The driveway is about 4 to 5 feet wide. My only option to not involve the driveway is redirecting it to our front yard which I dont want to do.

So main question, how difficult is it to dig under a driveway and is this a common practice? Or am I stuck with have to cut out a strip of the asphalt? Also if digging under is an option how would you backfill to support it again? My other crazy thought was sliding a heavy duty 6 inch or so pvc pipe under it and running my sump pump line though it.

I have 12""x4' footers planned for each beam support with notched 6x6 posts... should I bump those up to 16's? Just 16's under the roof support or is 12"" fine all around? If I decide to add a stacked stone column-wrap around the 6x6 cedar roof supports does that justify the 16's?  


Do I need another beam running through the middle? I plan on using 2x10 beams and 2x10 joists so the 12' from ledger to beam seems like it would be solid enough.

This has themes of mild violence and abuse flags, so if this isn't for you, you're warned.

At the time, I was 18F, now 20. He was 22M, now 24. She was the same age as me.

I met this guy, let's call him Loser, in November 2016, which happened to be my first year at university. He was volunteering for the theatre society that I had joined, having graduated the year before, as a pianist. 

We quickly became an 'item', with me hanging out around band rehearsals. This carried on until Christmas when I went home and we kept in contact. Home is stressful for me and I had a small mental break (nothing major). I didn't think much of it, but apparently he did. When I came back to uni everything carried on as normal and I thought we were fine. 

I didn't realise at the time, but he was isolating me from my friends and slowly caused me to cut off most of my friends in the process.

At the same time I became friends with another fresher and we hung out a lot. I considered this person a friend. We'll call her Nutter. As the semesters went on, they started talking. I was fine with it as I trusted them both and thought as we were all in the same society it was fine. 

Skip ahead to May and my birthday. The aftershow for out society's production fell onto my birthday night and we all went out and celebrated. I drank waayyy too much and ended up... Sick in the bathrooms. My housemate and friend who was there suggested taking me home.

By this time I had my suspicions about them. Nutter had wanted to talk to me a few weeks before, but had chickened out last minute. 

Loser ended up staying out until 4 in the morning where he called me to let me into he house. We went to sleep and that was it.

Move to mid June. This was where halls moved out, but those who lived in university houses (like me) could stay until July. This was when my two housemates that were left sat me down and told me that Nutter and Loser were having an affair since March, just after we'd signed for our student accommodation for second year.

I was (understandingly I hope) upset and went off at both N and L over text. 

Unfortunately, I had a week over summer when L was supposed to be coming to my parents house and we were taking a trip to where we had both (separately) spent holidays with our families. I even met his brother (who was very lovely and courteous).

Now comes September. I wasn't in a good mental state as I knew I'd have to live with Nutter and a few other people. I considered the rest of them friends, despite growing distant over the next few months. Unbeknownst to most of us, N and L had basically become a thing. 

We had a games night, with only me, N, another housemate and L.

This is where things went wrong.

I slept with L that night. I was stupid, I know, but I had that brief glimmer that I'd get something back from him. Turns out, 24 hours earlier he'd asked N to be his girlfriend.

In short, he'd cheated on me with her, and her with me.

She found out and claimed that I'd come onto him and didn't want to hear my side - he wanted to talk to me then lifted up the duvet where he was staying on the sofa.

It then came out that they'd been seeing each other for a while, even seeing eachother over the summer. 

After this, we made some rules. He could visit... On the proviso that they tell us.

Absolutely fine. We could get out of the way and be fine. 

However, after 6 months, this rule got broken. He 'surprised' her after one of her shows and they both said nothing, as well as someone with them. They came home and shit hit. 

They came in and there was a vauge 'oh, I didn't know he was coming'. I went to stop them from going upstairs, I DID NOT WANT HIM IN THE HOUSE.

We had an argument at the bottom of the stairs, and I have very little recollection of what happened next.

All I remember is him moving with my hand on his throat to the wall behind him. 

Long story short for what happened next, I had a breakdown in the living room, called my mum, a housemate had to calm me down.

The next day, N and L went to the police to file a case, but retracted it later. They went to our uni and I was almost kicked out for it. I had to apologise. They never had to apologise for pinning all of the blame on me as well as putting me through the emotional strain of the year and a half this lasted. 

I don't talk to either of them anymore. I still get upset sometimes, but I'm working through my issues. I've found a new romantic interest a year after all of this happened, finally getting over my anxieties around trusting people.

I'm not sure what I did was right or whether I could have done anything better... Does anyone have any advice on moving forward from all of this personally?

TLDR: Guy emotionally abuses and cheats on me for another girl, he cheats on her with me, I'm seen as a bad person, rules are made so he can visit our shared house are then broken, I have a moment of rage and get angry, threateningly aiming my hand at his throat to push him back. I have to apologise because I made one mistake.",relationships,"You cheat on me, then cheat on her... And I'm the bad lerskn for one mistake?"
t2_bmweu7o,1553813398.0,b6pk6j,t3_b6pk6j,3,"I've been best friends with Veronica for 5 years, she's had a terribly troubled life, has been through every terrible situation a human can find themselves in, including a plethora of abusive relationships. So far I've supported her through three. She has an awful saviour complex she is having trouble getting rid of.

She started dating Matthew in July of 2018. At first things seemed pretty good, but the red flags came when his ex girlfriend made a call-out post on Instagram about him physically abusing her. I tried to warn Veronica that abusers don't often change but she wouldn't have it. 

Veronica and I were living with my boyfriend at the time and when things fell through with me and him we were forced to find a place to live fairly quickly, and through a variety of circumstances we could only really find a place to live if Matthew lived with us as well. We all moved in together in October 2018.

Things were going fairly well at first, but Matthew has a seasonal job and winter is his off season, and Veronica is unemployed. They started spending every waking moment together which I warned them was probably not very healthy. They are both also alcoholics. 

The fights started to get very bad a couple months ago. Now at least once a week I wake up to them black out drunk and screaming at each other. Matthew has the tendency to throw things around, so there's a lot of banging. They fight about a lot of things, mainly him cheating on her. Recently he has started to become more physical with her. Throwing drinks on her and pushing her. 

Last night I woke up to Veronica screaming my name to help her. He ripped all of her posters of their wall and was stepping her on legs. This morning she's walking around with a limp. This is all very traumatic and triggering to me as well since I used to be in a physically abusive relationship. She is determined not to break up with him because according to her he has had multiple concussions in his life, thus resulting in some kind of personality disorder in which he has no control over his actions when he drinks. Supposedly they are both going to quit drinking, but it has been said before.

I'm really at a loss for what to do. Our lease was signed until October 2019, and I don't really have the money to move out anyways. I don't feel comfortable getting the police involved. 

tldr; my roommates are both alcoholics in an abusive relationship and I'm at a loss for what to do.",relationships,My (22F) roommates (23F) (22M) are in an abusive relationship and I don't know what to do.
t2_71ec2,1553767607.0,b6gxsb,t3_b6gxsb,12,"While this is a recent issue I want insight into, I feel the backstory is important so I will include it. I am sorry it is long, but I will do my best to tl;dr it.

In 2011 I was dating a girl that wanted things to be in the moment, not serious. We went to a halloween party and there I met this girl, who ended up being there with her boyfriend, but I was attracted to her. It was a coworkers party, and my lady friend also worked with me. A couple weeks later, I saw on a sheet that this girl I met at the party was a new hire and would be starting soon. About this same time the girl I was seeing decided to make it serious, and we became boyfriend and girlfriend. 

The girl I met, lets call her H, started and we ended up becoming pretty good friends. A few months later, H broke up with her boyfriend. She actually tried to ask me out, my girlfriend worked with us but we didn't talk about it or make it obvious so most people didnt know about it. But I politely declined as I had plans with my girlfriend. Very shortly after this, my GF cheated on me with another coworker and then broke up with me. 

Another coworker that was friends with both me and H pulled me aside and told me i should ask her out because it was obvious to him how much she liked me. I was going to, but the day i worked up the courage she walked into the back of house telling a coworker about her new boyfriend. We ended up becoming best friends at work, usually taking breaks together when they lined up. We became pretty good friends. 

I left the job, but wed still hang out and cook now and then. I ended up getting a job in a town 6 hours away. A week before I left we hung out, cooked, watched cartoons and cuddled. She ended up falling asleep on me and then left embarrassed when she woke up. 

A couple years later we were chatting via text and she brought up the time she fell asleep on me. And then said it was a very fond memory. We ended up admitting to each other that we had a crush on one another. We were always very flirty with each other. But I was too chickenshit to take it further for some reason.

\*So now this is where this situation starts.\*

Last november we were chatting and she suggested I stop by on my way through where she lived because I had to to get home. I told her I wasn't going home this year and we decided to cook together for thanksgiving. So I went and we made food and watched TV and ended up cuddling a bit. She suggested I stay the night there, I did. Nothing happened though.

The next day, I didn't sleep much the last night so I was pretty tired. I needed to drive home and she suggested I try and take a nap. So we laid on her bed and watched Netflix. I couldnt fall asleep, so we chatted, then she kissed me and immediately apologized as it was inappropriate. I said it was fine, asked if I could kiss her, and then we made out. I had to leave shortly after to drive home before it got dark, because it was a 3 hour drive and i didnt want to do it at night since i had so little sleep. I got home, but that night we decided to hang out again the next coming weekend.

Well, a couple days later she realized she had a thing to go to that weekend, so we moved it to the following weekend. Well, the following weekend at the last minute on the friday before I was going to drive up there, she told me she was too sick and couldn't hang out. I was bummed. I decided since she cancelled twice, that I wasn't going to try and make the plans for the next time we hung out. A week later she made plans for us to hang out at the end of the month, she was going to come visit me. 

Some comes to visit and we cook a fun dinner and then go out to a bar/arcade. We get drunk and when we get back we go to sleep. I didn't make a move because we were drunk and I have a fairly hard rule on that. The next morning when we woke up I did try and kiss her but she made excuses about morning breath. Shortly after this she went home as she needed to get back to her doggie. I went on instagram and found a post from 2 weeks ago I missed on hers and it was her with her boyfriend. I guess they got together sometime after thanksgiving. I felt horrified that I didn't know she was now dating someone but I tried to kiss her.  
I texted her, apologizing. Saying I hadn't seen the post and that I didnt know and was sorry if I was inappropriate. She said it was fine, and thats why we didn't do anything further. She said she thought I knew because I followed her on IG. It was kind of awkward, we both apologized a lot. We didnt talk for 2 days but when I texted her asking if I ruined everything, and she said no then asked if she did. I said no, and things went back to normal, we talked throughout the day. That night, I passed out while watching a movie, then woke up to texts from her saying that she was just dumped. I messaged her in the morning, apologizing and offering my sympathy and ear. 

We both love japan. She suggests we go to japan together. We were already both kinda thinking about it. So we start planning to spend 3 months in japan together. After a couple of weeks I suggest I come visit and discuss our plans more. I visit and it is a great weekend, things definitely heat up. Before I left, I ask what she is going to do because her apartment lease is up in 2 months but itll be longer before we go. She said shed try and find some random room in a house and so I said, why not move in with me. It would be better we found out if we could live together here, in the US than after we move to another country after all. She agreed. We then start planning for her to move in with me. Before I left I invited to take her to her favorite french restaurant for Valentines Day. She accepts. I decided I also needed to make it clear how I feel about her, because of all we planned. So I ask her if she understands, and she said it was pretty clear. But she just broke up with her boyfriend and didnt want to rush into things. I understood and told her I wasn't looking for labels right now, just that it was clear.

I go and visit her to take her out for Valentines day, as we wait for the Uber she is talking about a friend of hers in Cali thats coming to visit her. She then told me about how she told him she just wanted to be friends with the guy. So I didn't think much more of him coming to visit. We have a great weekend and make loose plans for her to come down and introduce the pets before she moves. I had also told her this weekend that I promised that things would be OK if she moved down no matter what happened. I wanted her to feel comfortable that nothing was contingent or that I wouldn't just leave her stranded if things went sour. I leave then the guy visits her a couple weeks later.

A little bit after this / a couple weeks ago we were talking and she asked about a way to get some umami flavor for breakfast without pork. I asked her if she was stopping eating pork and she said no, her friend doesnt eat pork. She told me why and I recognized the story as being her friend from Cali. Turns out he was visiting again. She said he just wanted to visit one more time before she moved down. He comes to visit, this was last weekend.

Last Sunday, towards the end of the day I ask how her weekend went and she says ""magical"". I thought it was a little flowery but kinda shrugged it off. Then later that night I saw an instagram post where she posted a selfie saying she felt ""loved"". So now I was really thinking there was more going on between the two of them. So I text her and ask her if they are. I should have waited as I had a friend over but he was on his way out the door. She responds ""I have been crushing on him lately but he lives in cali so it wouldnt work"". I said ""I see"" and then was trying to get my friend to leave to pick back up the convo. It ends up taking an hour. As he leaves she sends another text, ""If me having a crush is a problem, do I need to find another place?"" Keep in mind that she is moving down the next weekend.

I am a little drunk as my friend and I were having drinks so I totally botched my responses. I said ""Well you know how I feel about you, I just figured you'd let me know whats up"" she says ""I see, I will figure something else out"" I said ""You know I promised you that it would be fine no matter what"" She said ""I just didnt realize dating was part of the deal"" I told her it wasn't, I said that while I thought things definitely seemed to be trending in that direction, I didn't expect anything of her. I then reinterate that I had no expectations and that everything is fine with me. But I get no response.

The next morning I send a text apologizing for the night before, that I didn't mean to come off the way I did and that I really had no expectations but if she didn't want to move I would understand. She said she didn't think it was a good idea anymore because of my reaction. I didn't really know what she meant by that. I re-read our conversation and recognize just how awkward I said things and I try to explain that I really had no expectations and I wanted to know because I thought she said she just wanted to be friends with the guy and I needed to know how to behave around her because I was still embarrassed for what happened just before new years. She said she understood but couldnt really accept that there wasn't an expectation because of how I reacted. I asked her to explain how I reacted because I was really confused what she meant. Basically because of that pause and then I didn't say it was OK, I talked about how she knew how I felt and that I promised her I would take care of her.

Basically, I tried to explain that yeah I thought things were trending in that direction but I was fully aware that she could move down and we would just be friends. I couldnt really accept the situation if I wasn't aware of all these possibilities since we hadn't entered into a relationship at this point. She said she couldn't really believe that I didn't expect it and that she couldn't make me any promises that one would happen. I couldn't really seem to explain to her that I was fine if we ended up just being friends. So I said I bought her a little welcome gift and wanted to still send it to her. It was something I imported from japan and didn't want to just throw it away. She accepts so I mail it the next morning.

On Tuesday, I send her another message saying that I was really sorry how I came off and that things would be OK. I wished I could take back how I came across and that I had no expectations. She responds that it made her feel bad when I said ""You know how I feel ... but I made a promise to you"" and I realized how she took that. She took it to mean that I was now just bringing her in because I said I would. I felt horrified and I said that wasn't the case. I want her to move and that never changed and I never thought of it as an obligation. I just meant when I promised it would be OK no matter what. I should have been more explicit. She never responds.

The next morning I send a text just saying that I felt horrible for how I came across and I never thought of her as an obligation, that I wouldn't be trying to fix things if I did because I also wouldn't want myself in that situation. And that I wish there was a way I could help her understand that I just screwed how I conveyed myself. She just said that ""it's OK i know you are trying to fix it, its ok, im sorry I just need some space. A lot has changed in a short time and I need to figure out my life and emotions."" So I stopped texting her. This was yesterday. I was supposed to go up and help her move down tomorrow and I had requested the following week off to spend time together and get her situated. 

I know I made mistakes. But I don't know what to think of things. I guess I am just trying to fully understand where things went wrong or how I should interpret things on her part.

Good friend I had for a long time and I had admitted to liking each other but lived in different cities. We start planning a long trip to Japan together, end up offering her to live in my home before we go to japan. We kind of start having a deeper/sexual relationship, but right before she moves into my home I ask about a guy she seemed to like even though she told me she just wanted to be friends with him previously.

t2_3hz92itz,1553812298.0,b6pcgc,t3_b6pcgc,7,"First, I would just like to preface this post by saying that it is very possible that some of the things that I'm mentioning might not be a big deal, but due to growing up in an abusive home I sometimes have trouble knowing what's normal and what's not, and when I'm expecting too much or what's a normal expectation. Feel free to let me know if anything I'm saying is unreasonable, just please be aware that I'm not acting entitled or demanding. I posted here so I have a neutral opinion, because sometimes I just can't tell.

My husband and I have been married for 5 years, together for 7. Lately I feel like he doesn't make much effort in terms of planning out dates or fun things for us to do. He's always up for doing anything I suggest, but I'm always the one taking initiative to do things.

He also doesn't really try to do unexpected nice things anymore, while he used to (sending me flowers to work when I had a bad day, surprising me with my favorite cookies which you can only get in a few places, etc.).

However, for the past few months I knew he had been making a list of birthday gifts for me. We would be out and I would see something I liked or I would mention something related to my hobby that I wanted to try doing but that required a specific tool and he would make a note on his phone and wink at me. I was pretty excited, not because of the gifts themselves (they're not expensive things or things I wouldn't be able to get myself) but I was just happy that he seemed to be making an effort to do something nice and paying attention.

Last night during dinner, we were talking about my birthday coming up and he said ""so, since we are going to \[restaurant\] for your birthday I just got you one little thing."" My heart dropped a little bit. Not because I was expecting a ton of gifts necessarily, but basically he is using the fact that we're going to this one restaurant (which I was the one that planned and booked, and that required some coordination to get a reservation) as the reason why he's only getting me this one thing, which he said himself is a very small thing, when he's been hinting for months at the tons of gift ideas he had for me.

One thing to clarify here: while the restaurant we're going to is a nice restaurant is not anything outside of the normal for us, the only reason why it's special is that it's hard to get a reservation and I've been wanting to go there for a while. Another thing I'd like to clarify is that I'm not disappointed about the lack of gifts exactly, we do well financially and can get the things we want. Plus the couple of things that I know are in his list are not expensive. The reason why I'm so disappointed is that the gifts were the only show of effort that I was expecting from him, and now I heard from him directly that he only got this one small thing. I was really excited to see what else he came up with.

If I was expecting him to do anything (make me breakfast, plan a fun date) else I wouldn't care about the gifts but he hasn't done anything like that for a while. In the past for birthdays or anniversaries we have sometimes agreed to do no gifts and to just plan a fun date or outing or something, and I thought that was great, but that hasn't happened in a while, and when it does it's always coming from me.

Am I being unreasonable?

Should I talk to him about this? I feel like I should but I don't know the best way to do it. On one hand I feel like I should just talk to him now but I feel like maybe it's a bit silly and that I'm just getting myself worked up, when I don't know what he got me or if he's doing anything else (but I'm very much expecting that he didn't) or if I should wait until my actual birthday but then I'm expecting that I'll just end up disappointed and be really upset when it's my actual birthday and ruin the dinner I've been looking forward to for months.

t2_doqtg,1553790708.0,b6kyyu,t3_b6kyyu,1,"Long post, TL;DR at the bottom.

Well, I’m getting some help already. Going to talk therapy (psychodynamic, which means my therapist doesn’t really talk back a lot), and reading a book about core beliefs and attitudes in life, and how that affects relationships. I think I intellectually know most parts of this puzzle. But this shallow awareness isn’t helping me move towards better relationships.

For example, I have many friends, about 2000 on Facebook, but to be honest I don’t really feel close to any of them. I have a handful of friends that I spend time with more or less regularly, and it’s the same there. I might be wrong, but I don’t think any of them would call me as their go-to person in a crisis or emergency. It makes me feel very lonely and sad, even though I’m rarely alone, and usually very social, mostly happy, have many interests, and like to joke around. 

In intimate relationships, I’ve noticed a pattern. I tend to first idolize, then grow dispassionate, bored, or even disrespectful and neglecting towards my partner. Out of my seven “serious” relationships, the longest was 18 months. 
The feeling of being in love usually lasts about 2-4 weeks for me. The remainder of the relationship is usually a struggle where I try to find that same feeling again, forcing it, and ending up anxious for not being able to reciprocate the love I get from her(although, I actually seem to not be able to take that love in...). Being intimate is somewhat scary to me, and I’ve never dared to look a partner in the eyes to say I love you, because I wouldn’t speak the truth. But even if I did love her, I think I wouldn’t dare. 

In general, I seem to want something from people when I interact with them. For sure I am generous at times, in a genuine way, but mostly I tend to see people as a means to an end. Not in a full blown psychopathic/narcissistic way maybe, but I don’t recall ever being really interested in anyone else than me. This fact makes me very ashamed, I hate that I’m self absorbed by default, and I don’t know how to shake it off.

I tend to over analyze things, and this issue seems so complex to me. I don’t know where to start. A bunch of different factors dance around in patterns on different levels. But I don’t know how to see it clearly. Or how to step out of it. Must I be interested in people? Why can’t I feel really close or intimate with people? Why do I always put people higher or lower than myself, never feeling equal? Why do I see people as a means to an end?

TL;DR: I’m a 25 yo dude with many friends and relationships yet I don’t feel close or intimate with anyone, never have. Been self absorbed my whole life, but deeply longing connection.

*****
I started volunteering at a place a few months ago and I've recently developed an attraction to my boss (in the technical sense).

Intuition tells me that there's some degree of interest—he playfully teases me, compliments me often, touches me subtly, and drops casual comments about his relationship status around me. This started before I developed a crush, though it is kind of what fueled it. I've tried to be neutral since then but I tend to involuntarily smile a lot around him, so I'm pretty sure he knows that I have a crush on him by now.

We are both single, and if it weren't my workplace I would probably pursue something very casual. But I'm young and inexperienced (not even old enough to drink...) and there's the power imbalance from working under him, so I don't intend to do anything.

t2_tkgkv79,1553810767.0,b6p1lr,t3_b6p1lr,9,"I started working full-time at a new job a few months ago.  I really like this job because it makes things easier for my severe mental health issues.  (I have severe general and social anxiety, and depression, and this job allows me to have mostly only very highly structured social interaction with coworkers and customers.  It's also mostly minor physical labor, which means my mental and emotional energy (which is already pretty low due to the depression) aren't so drained at the end of the day that I can't do something fun or productive with my off-time.)

&amp;#x200B;

After a couple weeks I noticed a coworker of mine in another department who I find incredibly attractive and who is generally very much my type aesthetically. I don't generally find coworker relationships a good idea for reasons very similar to the problem I'm having now.  I worked at a different location of this company previously, but there were very few people my age who worked the same shift as me, so I never thought that this could be a problem when I started working at my new store, but obviously I should have guessed because it's a more normal shift in a much larger city.

&amp;#x200B;

There wasn't really any reason for us to directly interact/opportunities for casual socializing, as we are on different teams, and as I said, I see coworker dating as somewhat of a risky enterprise, so I decided it would be better to let this crush die out.  Unfortunately, rather than dying down, it instead got way bigger and our two departments/teams started socializing a bit more at work recently, so I ended up seeing a lot more of her, although we didn't really interact more directly.

&amp;#x200B;

I know you're all going to tell me I should have known this was a bad idea, and I did, but I was really into this person, and I have bad impulse control due to my mental illness.  So I deserve/accept any criticism.  I figured I'd try actively socializing with this person to see if there was even hope of something happening.  But literally the first time I tried to her to them outside of a clear work context they immediately shut me down.  It was kinda brutal, although I can't speak for whether she intended it that way, because I basically tried to say hi, and she passive-aggressively blew me off and we haven't interacted since.  I considered asking some of our coworkers if they knew why she was so stand-offish, because I've never seen her be anything other than polite or friendly to other coworkers or customers, but given her behavior I didn't want to make it seem like I was gossiping/ignoring her boundaries.

My original conclusion was that, given how obvious and unsubtle I am when trying to hide interest in somebody, she probably knew I liked her and didn't want to give me any false hope that would leave me annoying her for the next several months until I finally took the hint that she wasn't interested.

&amp;#x200B;

But as many people do, I've let my interest build up far beyond where it should have, and while I have reasons/excuses for that, I know it's not healthy.  That said, now that it's gotten there, even though I think she's made it clear she's very much not interested, I have a really hard time getting her out of my head and not noticing her when I see her at work.  Like, if I'm working in an area near her department, I often can't help but look over to see if she's there.

Since we work the same five days as each other on roughly the same shift, we also usually end up in the break room for lunch and breaks at the same times, and it's a small, open area.  Every time I see her, it adds to/reinforces my crush, even though I don't want it to.  When I try very hard, I can manage to avoid running into her for most of the day, but obviously that still involves actively thinking about her, and when by random but not unlikely chance I can't manage to completely avoid her, I lose pretty much any progress I've made in moving past my feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

She pretty much never visually registers my presence at all, unless we happen to accidentally lock eyes in a moment of me being weak and glancing at her across the salesfloor/breakroom, and none of our mutual friends/coworkers has ever mentioned the issue, so I guess it's possible I'm worrying over nothing as far as the bothering her part.  I know sometimes I think other people are more aware of my behavior/feelings than they really are because of my obvious emotional investment/mental health issues.

So the two questions I'd like some advice on are how, given our work situation, I can do things to help me get past this crush on her, and also what I can do to avoid potentially making her uncomfortable with my behavior until I do get past it.  I don't have any hard feelings over her not being interested, and I know some other male coworkers have made moves on/hit on her, so I would feel really bad if I made her time at work less fun than it already is given we're working shitty retail jobs.

And obviously for my own peace of mind, I would like to not be so uncomfortable at work.  Prior to this whole crush thing, I was really not not enjoying working here, and I think it would be hard for me to find another job that would be as tolerable given my mental health issues.  I've previously had work crushes that resolved themselves much more simply and quickly than this, and I was not prepared for this one to get so annoying go on for so long.  If it weren't for that, I would feel kinda silly posting here about it, but I'm out of ideas for how to deal with it.

I had confided in his mother when I found out and told her - eventually it led to me talking about my OWN mother to which I disclosed that my mom and I have no relationship, she was very verbally/emotionally abusive to me as a child and now that I am in my adult years I have chosen to not have my mom very involved in my life.
She knows that I am pregnant but that’s pretty much it.
My boyfriend doesn’t live in the same state I do at the moment and I refuse to tell her where he lives for safety reasons and my own sanity. 
I basically told my boyfriends mother that I don’t wish to have a relationship with my mother and etc etc..

Well today, come find out that my boyfriends mom has MY mom added on Facebook and has been messaging her?????
Funny thing is I have my mom blocked off my social media and I do not even have my own little sister on my Facebook (mostly bc she’s never on and doesn’t use it hardly) so that means my boyfriends mom had to look up my sister - go through her friends list - dig through her profile - find my mom via last name - add her.
It angers me SOOOO much that she would even do that behind my back?! Because for 1 - now she knows the general area of where my boyfriend lives and when I decide to move - I want to do so without my mom harassing me. (Which she has done in the past!)

I once moved to Oregon and didn’t tell her where I was moving because I wanted peace and quiet and I made the mistake of telling her my address once because she said she wanted to send me a birthday gift and fast forward a week later she was pissed off I didn’t want to send her money so she called the local police there and basically told them that I ‘robbed’ her before moving and she would like for them to go to my house and search the place for ‘her things’.
It was a LONG process and exhausting and stressful for me.
Obviously the cops ended up doing nothing but just going though trying to find receipts for year old things I have bought and just trying to prove everything Was mine was just stress I DIDNT NEED.
And this has happened MULTIPLE times..
My mom plays nice - I feel bad and want to tell her things bc she is my mother and when she gets mad at me she just tries to use it to her advantage.
So I’ve learned it’s just best to only tell her small details that I don’t mind her knowing but nothing about my personal life. 


Fast forward to now - my plan was to move to the boyfriend before baby is due and not tell my mom so I could just focus on my new family and live stress free
And with my boyfriends mom adding my mom and messaging her behind my back - my mom now knows where my boyfriend lives which could cause MAJOR issues for me if I want to move forward with my life.

I just think it’s so wrong and such an invasion of MY privacy - after I tell my boyfriends mom that my mom and I do NOT talk and she decides to hunt her down via FB and add her / message her.

That is basically like if I said I was adopted and didn’t know my real mother and she went and tracked her down to message her and tell her things about my life.

I think my boyfriends mom crossed a HUGE line and I am SOOOO mad!!
However I don’t know if I’m overreacting from pregnant hormones or if I have every right to be upset.
I have finally gotten to a point in my life right now where I am happy and stress free without having to deal with my mother and especially after telling the BF’s mom that I’m not close with mine and she doesn’t know much about my current life - WHY would she track her down and add/message her??

I want to tell the boyfriends mom she is way out of line for doing that and basically compromised my safety and sanity by doing that behind my back but not sure how to tell her.
My boyfriend is a huge mamas boy and won’t tell his mom she crossed a line even though he agrees with me.
I love and respect my boyfriend enough to not cuss his mom out, but I am soooo angry and unsure of what to even say to her at this point without flipping my shit on her.

Did she cross a line??? Or maybe I am over reacting..??
Like I said, it just infuriates me that my mom now knows things I chose not to tell her for my own safety and sanity. If she starts messing my life up, it effects my boyfriend and that’s not fair to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is short description about us. We met 4 years ago on her 18. It was never supposed to be LTR, but we immediately fall in love, our personalities seemed like a perfect match. We had a great time together regardless of the age gap. Her family loves me and if we break up I will miss them very much. I always tried to be caring, sensitive guy and I don't want to buy in to ""girls only like douches"" mentality, though right now my feeling are all over the place. I helped her go through depression, took her to doctors, help her to pay for school, I am cooking (she never leave house without lunch in the box), found us an apartment in bigger city co we can have decent jobs.... I don't want to stack favors, it's just my point that I was trying to be a good partner.

Few days ago when confronted she admitted she have an affair. There was some clues, she stopped picking phone at random times, sometimes get late without explanation and so on. It is taking two months now and she even spend a weekend there, while lying she went to visit parent in another town.

She is making 50 percent of people I truly care about. Other than that, I just have my best friend. It's not that I am hideous or socially impaired. I am just introvert with somewhat time consuming hobby and I was happy that way. So dumping her will be very hurtful for me, because I might end quite alone and it scares me. She is not wiling to ditch her affair, though if that was the case I might consider forgiving her and try to work on repairing the damage. But since she is unable to at least give me pinky promise she will end it, I don't see anything else I can do then break-up.

Guy she is seeing is like 20 years older, have family and kids. So after she leave I am almost certain her affair will eventually fall apart. Which makes me double sad, because I do care about her and I think this will be lesson about regret.

We are living together, so after we say that we are done, we will remain at least for a while roommates. I have no idea how to deal with that.

t2_3hx44itw,1553787774.0,b6kczy,t3_b6kczy,4,"My parents are scientists who live only for science. My not becoming a scientist was a real let-down for them. By way of background, my mother was born and raised in Switzerland and earned her PhD there in physiology. My father was raised in Germany and earned his PhD in genetics. My parents met during a post-doc in Europe and moved to the US to take-up jobs at a university. We grew up very comfortable in NYC and enjoyed a really great quality of life. My parent’s marriage is one of intellect. They love and respect each other, but are passionate about their intellectual pursuits more than anything else. That always came first and they supported one another in that endeavor. They never learned to “shut it off” as it were and so their marriage is very odd. They prioritize work over spending time together and only ever talk about committees, teaching assignments and preliminary findings. They have no common topics outside of that. They’re still teaching and conducting research and will do so to the day they die. There is no retirement for them. 

My siblings are all high achievers. My oldest sister earned a PhD in physics and married a professor and they live in the Midwest. My brother went to medical school and works in a pediatric intensive care unit. I have an associate’s degree and work in sales. I just never found my passions led me to academia – I love to camp and take road trips and do other things, but school was not my thing. My sister’s husband is an academic and my brother’s wife was an oncology nurse who stayed home full time to care for children. I model my relationships most on my brother. He and his wife are not only husband and wife, but best friends. They have things beyond professional achievements and have a life together. They can talk and gossip and his wife can call him on his BS. That’s who I model a lot of my ideas on as my parents aren’t a great template. My sister’s marriage is exactly like my parents. While my sister and parents are nice, they only interact with people like them – people with PhDs or people who are on that pathway. They deal almost exclusively with ultra-high achieving people. My brother is somewhat different I think because he deals with the public. He’s a lot more open and accepting and understands that not everyone is fascinated by T cells or quarks. My brother had dinner with us (me and the BF) and it was a lot easier/smoother than I had thought. My brother treated us to a nice place and we followed that up with a BBQ at his house where my BF and brother learned to use a smoker my brother just got. 

My boyfriend is an executive assistant and does a great job, is kind, sweet and charming. Like me, school isn’t his thing and we share so many interests outside of school. I’ve met his family and they’re wonderful. I’ve been putting off introducing him to the rest of my family for almost a year now. My parents and sister are hurt that I would introduce the BF to my brother and not them when I’ve had so many opportunities to. I told my SIL about my concerns and she chuckled as she felt so awkward meeting my parents the first time. My brother’s advice is to just jump in with both feet. I’m not so sure. 

I’ve told my family very little about BF. I’ve told BF a bit about them. I’m wondering if I need to meet my parents and tell them about him and be very clear about how to talk to him. They have this very frank, very Germanic way of saying things that can be a bit too direct. I’m worried they’ll insult him because they say something without thinking. I grew up feeling dumb and less-than because they were always worried about me because I didn’t do well in science. I was even tested for learning disabilities and emotional problems because I was an average C+/B- student. BF is the same way. We’re happy people who aren’t dumb, but my parents really, very seriously, don’t understand that. Their will includes extra provisions for me to “help me” because of my different abilities compared to my other siblings. 

tl;dr In their own weird and awkward way, they love me and want the best for me. They want to be a part of my life, but they have a way about them that is incredibly blunt and can be hurtful.

I just found out my bf (M20) actually did have sex with this girl the first time we broke up a few months ago. About 2-3 weeks after we were broken up. After we made up, he told me they hung out while we were broken up and promised me nothing happened when I asked. The thing is we had breakup sex 2 weeks into the breakup. So he did it with this girl days after we had sex. 

After we had sex, we had a fight the next day, so things seemed done for good. But STILL. He was still heartbroken, as was I. It was still fresh. It was as if he did it with her days after we broke up.

We broke up a few months after this first break up (I still didn’t know about what he did) and got back together again, and now we’re still together. He knows I’ve always been jealous of this girl cuz they had a “thing” a few years back (I think it was a sexual relationship mostly) and stayed friends, and she cheats on her boyfriend with a ton of people. The only times he likes her pictures is when we are broken up. On top of that, he replied to an Instagram story of hers days after our second breakup. 

The reason I didn’t know until now is because I just went on his phone for the first time in a long time, just because I was curious to see if he was talking to anyone while we were broken up. When I confronted him about it he told me he wanted to leave it in the past and not hurt me. He said he was really sorry.

Now it’s like I can’t stop thinking about him touching another woman other than me. Or him being turned on by this girl, because unfortunately the text to his friend he told about it had details like his playing with her butt and other things. I’m just upset about so much and I don’t know what to do, because I want to be with him and I know he would never cheat on me. I know he wouldn’t have sex with her again anyways because he expressed to his friend how sketched out he was since she kept saying no after she’d allow him to do things.

I’m just mostly hurt that it happened between them,  and that it was days after he did it with me. I know he loves me so much and find me attractive but it’s just shitty. He says it was because he was trying to get me off of his mind but I don’t care. 

TL;DR- My boyfriend and I had two breakups, and I just found out that he had sex with someone during our first breakup. And even though it was during a time where we thought it was over for good, it was days after he and I had breakup sex. I know he loves me and finds me very attractive, and would never see her as relationship material, it still sucks that it happened.

t2_e9ixh,1553808669.0,b6omrh,t3_b6omrh,1,"A bit of background: I've been single for about two years now, after having a bad breakup with my ex that left me emotionally unavailable to every woman that came into my life since. A few months ago, I met this girl and now we've been dating for about four months. After going out and meeting/dating tons of women, she's the first person I've felt anything for since my ex and has opened me back up to caring about someone again, and being open to a serious relationship again. It feels humanizing and great. However, a few months prior, she ended her relationship of a few years and currently is in the frame of mind that I've been in for the last two years...

We've been open and communicated well and she says that she has feelings for me but isn't ready for anything serious. While that's hard to hear, I get it and respect her boundaries by keeping things causal with her like she wants, rather than trying to force her into anything (love in a way that makes them feel free). While I can deal with this and still see other women (none of which have remotely captivated me like this girl), the main issue here is that she travels for work...

Not only am I developing intense feelings for someone who says she has feelings for me back, but her job makes me feel like shit, despite me getting a new job that a month ago  I was ecstatic for at the time. Between her social media posts, and our conversations when we do hang out on weekends, I can't help but feel immense jealousy towards her life, and I know I shouldn't. She gets to travel to all these cool places, try new things and have all these amazing experiences, all while getting paid for it (possibly more than I'm getting paid), while I'm clocking into the same building, doing the same job day in and day out. I know she's just excited to tell me about her week, and not actually trying to 1up me, and I try to be centered and calm, but deep down it's killing me inside. (She's also mentioned that she's getting tired of the traveling and wants another position that'll have her stay in the area.)

I've never had this much fun with or had this level of intimacy with anyone before. It's been amazing! She's said that she's starting to warm up but also has made disqualifying comments like ""have fun on your dates while I'm away"" but will also call to tell me how much she misses me, or that she was on a date and couldn't stop thinking about me the whole time. Given that this girl is damn near everything I want in a woman, and the level of connection we have when were together, should I try to stick it out for when she stops travelling, or should I accept that things aren't lining up and cut her loose? (I don't want to give in to my insecurities and jealousy and cut things short when they could potentially work out in time). We live in a city, so I understand there's plenty of fish in the sea, however I haven't met anyone or seen anyone of her caliber, (according to what I look for in a woman) yet. (Not trying to put her on a pedistal, but it's true so far). I understand this is all coming from a place of weakness and insecurity and I'm trying to focus on my life and purpous, so any additional advice is welcomed.

I understand that he's busy and im fine if he replies when he can, but sometimes I know he's read it and just doesn't feel like responding. he's very attentive and loving, but we talked about it today and he said sometimes ""he just doesn't know what to say,"" after I expressed it makes me anxious and like what I'm saying isn't important enough. we call pretty frequently, and that's better. he also has aspergers, which could be affecting this

t2_3hyjw8rh,1553807728.0,b6ofzo,t3_b6ofzo,7,"Hello! So, this one might be kind of long but I need to give sufficient background here because context is super important for this situation.

I've been working at this small company for about a year and a half now. By small, I mean 4 people that work in the office full time. We spend a lot of time together (9 hours/day) and we also go to work events together outside of that time occasionally (we work in the entertainment industry). Now, said bully coworker (lets call him G) has been at this company for six years. The coworker he's bullying (lets call her R) has been at this company for five and a half. They've both been here the longest out of everyone. The fourth coworker is 25M (lets call him M). He's been with the company for four years.

&amp;#x200B;

G is a very outgoing person. He comes off as friendly when he first meets people because he can be very polite and articulate. However, he is very opinionated and feels the need to loudly state those opinions whenever he can. This includes in the workplace. He also over exaggerates things often, (ie: he has stated to our boss things like ""If we don't get this new software we are going to be LIGHTYEARS behind everyone else. This software we're using is TERRIBLE and there's no point in doing our jobs anymore if we don't have the new one, honestly.""). Very dramatic, and most of the time when he says things like this they're not true. He's very into politics and likes to read articles and books and listen to podcasts (fine) but this seems to make him think that he's smarter than everyone else. Especially smarter than R. He also has the most seniority and therefore our boss gives him a lot of control. This contributes to his already gigantic ego. He has previously stated that he is the best there is at his job and couldn't possibly improve anymore (which I think is bullshit for anyone to say. There's always new things to learn). One of the most frustrating things he does (as someone who makes fun of people, even strangers on the street) is if R says anything remotely mean about another person he'll act all righteous all of a sudden and accuse her of being a bully or being mean. Which is exactly what he is 95% of the time. He is just awful to be around. His inflated sense of importance is just too much to handle sometimes. I could go on but I hope this suffices.

&amp;#x200B;

R is quite the opposite. She rarely states her opinion, opting to go with the flow of things more often than not. She is a pushover definitely and therefore an easy target. She is very sweet, and enjoys things like Disney and musicals (things which G hates). She is self conscious about her weight as she is a little chubby, and he will exploit that. She doesn't say anything negative ever to anyone except a few close friends and in our industry she has a reputation as being a nice and sweet person. She loves girly things, and recently got married so was very into telling us about her wedding planning (G doesn't believe in getting married and felt the need to state that each time she shared details about her wedding). She doesn't like conflict but G craves it and often causes it. She runs away from these situations.  She is very sensitive, to a fault. I do get frustrated with her sometimes because I want her to handle things and stand up for herself a little bit. She is just *too* nice.

&amp;#x200B;

M is friends with G and doesn't say much either way. He tries to stay away from the drama but, in my opinion, contributes by doing this. I'll explain:

&amp;#x200B;

So. Going back to when M started, the three of them really hit off. They became friends and hung out outside of work (by choice) all the time. Work events were fine and regular office hours were fine. Then, slowly R tells me, G started to pick on her. It started slow. M and G would hide behind corners and scare her in the office or make a joke about the way she said a word, or how she didn't catch the frisbee during lunch in the park. These kinds of things went on until I started a year and a half ago. Then things began to escalate.

&amp;#x200B;

When I started, they began a group WhatsApp chat in order to talk about me, mostly my progress and wether they would keep me on full time, etc. (important side note: Our boss makes these decisions but is half in retirement and relies on the word of us workers for most things. He ultimately just approves/disapproves things and thats it. Which is why G with most seniority gets away with a lot). Then slowly I gravitated towards R more because she was the only other female in the office. She invited me to her wedding shower, and staying over at her place, etc. Both G and M saw this and they began to hang out more without us. Instead of inviting R like they used to, once I came along, they started hanging out just the two of them. Then this group chat slowly morphed into G and M chatting back and forth on WhatsApp on their computers all day. Slowly this morphed into a guys vs. girls sort of situation. They talk, but not to us. Even though we often ask if they want to come for a walk on breaks or participate in work events with us, they don't return the favour. This has created a weird dynamic in the office where everyone cant be friends like they all were before, even when I started.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, G is openly mean to R. He has called her fat and said she is not good at her job and he refuses to help her get better (they do the same job and she started 6 months after him so he trained her). He said this in the WhatsApp chat to M, which R then saw open on his desktop at work. He has lectured her about ""slacking"" even though he often watches YouTube videos all day at his desk, and he is not the boss and it was not his place to lecture her about anything. Recently, we were all supposed to go to a work event together but M, R and I cancelled and G was so angry with R only. He called her selfish and mean. She did point out that everyone cancelled but he just said ""if you can't see how selfish you are then I'm done here"". He makes comments about how she is dumb and her friends outside of work are dumb. Her life decisions (getting married, getting a car, etc.) are all dumb too. He is just always singling her out. He thinks she is weak.

&amp;#x200B;

Their hatred for each other has grown to the point where they aren't friends any more, and being in the office can be unbearable at times with the tension between them. They never actually said they weren't friends so this tension comes from them acting normal but hating each other and never discussing it.

M doesn't help as he participates in this WhatsApp chat back and forth and I can hear them typing whenever R says something, and I know they're talking shit to each other. M doesn't directly bully R but doesn't stop G either or even try to get him to relax and think reasonably in anyway. G can really get himself all worked up about things and go off on R or anyone with a different opinion than him on anything and this makes the office environment terrible.

R went to our boss when she saw the WhatsApp chat on their screen originally, he moved her desk so they were separated in the office. That doesn't fix their relationship though. Our boss won't do much, but we have a union which R could go to. It just means she would really blow everything up at our office, and our boss may be angry as it would be going over his head.

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to report his behaviour anonymously to the union, which I really want to, then everything would blow up. G would probably be investigated and with only three other people in the office (one being his friend M) he would find out pretty quickly who did it. I'm just starting my career and I don't want to risk his backlash, but I feel strongly about this guy. He deserves to be taken down a notch at least. What he's doing isn't right, and the entertainment industry really is an incubator for bullies like this. It's difficult to report this type of thing if you want to keep your job.

I can only encourage R to do something so many times, but I can't *make* her do anything. Every day is worse as they have little spats here and there and never discuss issues. He just blows up sometimes followed by an awkward silence until he gets over it.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the best way to stop G from treating R like this (and acting like this in the workplace) without destroying our small company/ my own budding career with G's potential backlash? Is it even my place to deal with this if she is the victim and she doesn't want to do what I would do?

We started texting later on. I told him calling me names was not OK even in an argument. He said he was sorry if he upset me. I said thanks, yes I was upset because I thought we were good at not calling each other names and I was disappointed. I asked why we would want to date each other if he thought I was dumb (kind of a rhetorical question). Then he said he wasn't going to argue about this because he was too busy, which makes sense since he was at work.

However, it has been a whole day since and we haven't talked at all.

After the end of this relationship I struggled for about 1 year with threats, isolation, people turned against me by this person, internet bullying and whatnot.

I sort of got over it or learn to live with the memories and never really cared that much although I was left with a very low self-esteem.

I had a few other long term relationships in my life that were very normal and non confrontational, no drama, and I preferred it that way. I never really had too intense feelings in these relationships and even when I got dumped I didn't suffer that much.

I never really felt in love and I was just choosing my partners by judging how ""normal"" they are, and at the smallest sign of confrontation or fight I would just bail without any remorse.

Recently I met somebody and I really fell in love this time, and all my judging about what's ""normal"" went out the window. Now we are in a relationship and I couldn't be happier but sometimes we fight, and instead of being rational and resolving the issues, every time an issue is addressed I just can't help but reminding myself how worthless I am, all the memories from 10 years ago come back to me and the abusive words of that person ring in my head and i just sink into this pit of self pity and self harm, which doesn't solve anything. It just dismisses the reason of the fight (which usually is not even a big deal) and everything becomes about me being a piece of shit that doesn't deserve to live. And it is a vicious circle because as my partner tries to reassure me that everything is okay I become guilty about acting like this and feel even more shitty.

I am aware that this is not healthy on my part, and I keep beating myself over it and I am afraid that I will ruin my relationship with this person that I love so much for the first time in my life. I have never felt or acted like this before, it feels like love brings the worst out of me.

t2_10qe6y,1553807191.0,b6obyo,t3_b6obyo,1,"Let me start this by saying that my ex is an admirable person. He possesses integrity and a passion for both justice and those topics he is interested in. He has reasoned arguments for most of his beliefs. He randomly volunteers to help his friends with day long enterprises. He adopted a dog from a shelter and takes good care of her. These are the reasons why I became his friend and then his boyfriend. 


Becoming his boyfriend was in hindsight a mistake. I had never dated before and he lives a 6 hour drive / 2 hour flight from me, but he’s the first person I’ve felt so strongly for. Indeed, while we were dating I was basically obsessive about him. When he talked to me I was ecstatic. If he didn’t reply for half a day I was depressed.  After he started school he had less energy to put into the relationship, and broke up a month later with that reasoning, which seemed reasonable to me. When we broke up I was super sad for about 3 months. It took me 2 of them to cry, but it was the first time in a decade I had done so. I still cannot walk along some streets in my hometown without recalling how despairing I was. 


With that said, two months before the breakup my feelings had already diminished from the strong burn they had been at. Part of this was the normal wearing off of endorphins. Part of it was how I interpreted his lack of energy - and his comments, when I brought this up, about how he’s become jaded from past relationships and generally less attached - as him caring less. This made me more anxious - and more edged and withdrawn to match.


This shift in attitude made our differences more clear and more burdensome. I’m not like him. I’m experimental rather than committed, broad rather than deep, theoretical rather than practical, and - as he’d maybe put it - white collar rather than blue. I grew tired of mostly talking about the couple of topics he’s interested in, but was too insecure about my shallow knowledge to bring up my own. I started feeling more worn when he shut down - sometimes impatiently - the half-formed arguments I have a habit of making. I could not help but to feel like his opinions were narrow and self righteous, his questions were critical, his counterpoints were mocking. I perceive our interactions as periodically losing warmth.


This has generally been the trend - sometimes we trade memes and light hearted comments, but the light stuff all feels limited and unsatisfying and the heavy stuff makes me feel hurt and bitter. On Tuesday he said “it’s genuinely exhausting talking to you” and I don’t disagree. Talking to him is tiring now. I told him “then don’t” because I don’t want him to waste his time on something that doesn’t provide a return. But I’d rather he talk to me and we somehow make our conversations worthwhile again.


I stayed his friend because he’s an admirable person. His integrity challenges me to clarify my own moral stance and live up to my own self image. His passion inspires me to think more about the community I live in and to develop a deeper knowledge about those subjects I’m curious toward. His reasoned arguments push me to more conscientiously develop and defend my own - to become a proponent rather than a dilettante. I’d like to become able to appreciate all of this again, but I don’t know how to and don’t know if it’s worth doing. 


Tldr:
My friend said “it’s genuinely exhausting talking to you” and I feel the same way. Our conversations are either unsatisfying or bitter. I can no longer appreciate what he has to offer.

I waited 10 days before reaching out to him figure out why he did what he did. He basically told me, he didn't want the stress of a relationship and that he got overwhelmed and let the stress take over. He asked for more time to gather his thoughts...he still couldn't face me like a man.

t2_14uql0,1553806854.0,b6o9ho,t3_b6o9ho,3," I[27M] am currently working in a software company and met this girl who joined 5 months after me. Even though she was good looking and was very jovial I didn't bother much about her as I was going through a phase where I was fed up of girls and thoughts of relationships in general due to previous disappointments. After a few weeks she used to initiate talks with me even with random topics like showing a video of how a flood completely destroyed an area. 

As months passed by I started liking that girl beyond a point after she once said that she'd rather start her own business than writing code for a software tech. Few weeks before she used to talk for consecutive 3 or 4 days once she entered the office and one day all of a sudden she stopped initiating the talks. She does reply whenever I talk but not as self initiated as she does with others. 

Her behavior became erratic since she suddenly at one moment comes up and shows that she gave a dinner treat to a guy(an older teammate who is married) and when I asked ""Nothing for me? "", she replies mockingly "" Why should I, I'll give treat when you give me"".She also avoids talking anything to me in cafeteria but picks up on any point if it is about teasing me. I tested what her reaction would be when I hide my phone chat from view/move to another spot whenever I was talking with a friend about my situation with her and she literally asked me who I was so secretively talking to such that I was hiding my convo. 

After gathering advice from a few friends, I started ignoring her. She continued making jokes on me day before yesterday and I showed myself to be pissed off. She immediately texted me after she left office apologizing since I wasn't behaving normal that day. 

I immediately replied her asking if I was the only person who wasn't behaving normally and she was shocked since I asked that question and asked if everything was alright. I replied a big NO. 

Thanks to the stupid network issues in my area, my messages couldn't reach her for almost an hour and she got pissed off and literally shouted over the chat on why I wasn't replying to her question. I replied calmly explaining the network lag and she said ""ok, good night"".Now I got pissed off and immediately asked her to look up on my previous chats to check how she quickly replied to my texts and she didn't give an answer for that. 

I straightaway asked her why she was acting weird to me for the past 3 weeks and she plainly refused that she didn't mean anything like that. She also suddenly changed the whatsapp story to a pic of her parents in between our chat and when I asked if she's upset over something because that's usually the time when someone misses their family. She replied "" Yeah may be I am upset but I donno"".I told her she could share if she really felt like it and she said she wasn't upset over anything. She even added a pic of a random idiot to her story just to make me jealous but I didn't bother. I went on to say that she should stop worrying over anything, since I was concerned a bit more than the others. 

The next day she was back to square one but wasn't mocking/teasing but rather talking generic stuff to me like asking to not hurrying on eating snacks till a certain teammate arrives and asking for my share of money for the snacks to pay. I started ignoring her again and the only time she looked at me was when I was leaving office before her and she stares for like a few seconds. This is the 2nd time she was staring while I was leaving office before her. 

I am really divided between the suggestions provided by my friends as half suggested to let her know my feelings and the other half told me to wait for some time, keep ignoring her so that she can get some space to think and then propose her if I wanted on my birthday which is literally 4 months away and then proceed. 

P.S:  Not the too many fish in the sea advice. I'm in India where most morons focus more on reducing others chances to get a girl than increase their own chance. As I said earlier I was previously fed up of girls but giving a try this time since I felt there will be a different result this time. I have gone through crap in my life and the only thing I need apart from a career is someone who understands me since my parents don't care if I feel happy or not but want to boost their own egos. 

TL;DR A girl who was talking properly with me has gone cold. She does reply when I ask something but doesn't initiate the talks as before. She does get too concerned regarding who I was chatting with and teases me whenever she can. She got mad when I literally delayed a reply by an hour.

I need help on the proper way to prevent water from getting under the J channel above the external of the garage. 

Vinyl siding on the house, comes down to a j channel, apparently 2 layers of aluminum wrapped around the wood pieces around the garage (where I found trapped water). Bottom of j channel was caulked to the aluminum wrap. 
I believe improper overlapping was done (no caulk, and at some point someone put a sheet metal screw through a j channel). 
This is for a 2 door garage and a single door garage (both had water trapped between aluminum wrap and wood). 
I’m asking because I believe a drip pan was left out, but I am unsure of the order to install each when going back up.. would the drip pan be first, then j channel, the aluminum wrap.. or should the small lip of the drip pan be noticeable externally when the instal is finished.

[This is the current state of the pool](https://i.imgur.com/C28kmAG.jpg)

This started a couple of years ago when we had a season of really heavy rain which caused the sand/dirt/ground on the right side of the pool to slide in and crack the concrete deck on that side and also cause bulges and tears on the pool wall. Back then my father decided to empty the pool to work fixing the bulging and tears(He has years of experience working with fiberglass in other fields).

Work on it stopped for reasons but they are ready to work on it again.

The problem right now is that my dad doesnt have enough space in the right side to place the fixed fiberglass pieces back in place. What he wants to do is to remove all of the right side(red square in the image) . And put some kind of wall structure in place(plywood sheets or metal) so the dirt(yellow arrows) does not slide back down again(rain season is about to start again). And flatten down the ground in that side so we can walk on it and to get it ready for the concrete deck. He says that after that he will be able to place the fiberglass back easily.

Me and my mom think that is not a good idea, we think that it is going to take too much time and might not work in the end. We think he needs to use the sand bags in the bottom of the pool to create a barricade in the right side of the pool and patch it out immediately. Then he can fill the outside hole again with dirt or gravel and flatten it out.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think is the best course of action here? Do you have other idea? Most of the problem right now is the right side.

I got a long list of chores and if I didn't complete it to 100% perfection then came the yelling. And I could never do anything perfectly for her.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I was 'gifted'. My parents took me to a lot of psychologists and professors who IQ-tested me and I started school 2 years early. I enjoyed learning, and tbh I enjoyed being told what a super clever, special kid I was. But the age difference meant that I wasn't really accepted in my class and always had very few people who would even talk to me. My mother made sure I could have many hobbies and actively supported me, but only in the things she thought worthwile.

&amp;#x200B;

As I grew older, it became clear to me I was growing up to be a very different person than her. Where she is all about cleanliness, I am messy and disorganised (I  have ADD, so....). Where she is practical and always eager to tackle work, I am laid back and clumsy. We have almost nothing in common. I'm depressed and don't have a lot of mental energy, and have largely abandoned my creative hobbies which disappoints her further. I think she expected that I would stay on the track to be this super wonder child and probably write my first bestseller with 12 or something. Instead I have turned to partying, music that she doesn't like and sports, but just for fun, not competition.

&amp;#x200B;

She never kept it a secret that she is disappointed in the way I 'turned out'. Just a few weeks ago she told me I could be more attractive if I tried, I could make more out of myself etc, I am abnormal for being single and will probably die alone, and that even when I was a kid she never knew 'what to do with me'. Now, I am used to that kind of talk and usually it would just roll off my back, but for some reason this time it really hit me. We had a huge argument which ended with me telling her to leave my place and not contact me again. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's now been one month and for some reason this time reality is really setting in for me. I think I've finally lost hope that we could ever have a good relationship, and that it's better if we have next to no contact, but also recognizing this has pushed me further into depression. I really struggle to accept once and for all that she thinks so badly of me. Probably made worse by the fact that she is now trying to make up and has sent me voice messages where she is crying about how she knows she wasn't a good mom etc... but I just cannot forget all the insults and hurtful things she has hurled at me. It feels like talking to her again would be pure hypocrisy knowing what a failure she thinks I am.

&amp;#x200B;

This last week I've barely had the strength to get out of bed in the mornings and I cry every night. Although I know that she isn't 'right' about it I now struggle with all these feelings of being a failure that don't even really come from me, but I guess I've absorbed them over 24 years of being around her. I am in therapy but I don't feel like my therapist really understands what I'm talking about most of the time and I've already switched therapists twice.

I'm young. I'm naive. But regardless, I don't know what to do here.

My girlfriend and I have been together for over 3 years.

The relationship has certainly had its ups and downs, but there have been periods where we fought a lot, had a dead bedroom (even an overall lack of intimacy) (the longest spell of this was \~9 months).

We have had good times in our relationship, we have traveled together, but we have some fairly serious issues.

Her problems with me include that I often arrive at her house late (usually not when we have time-sensitive plans, but I still understand her frustration completely); that I get offended easily and that she feels she cannot say things to me; that I have trouble with indecision; and that I have historically gone from one extreme to the other in things like exercise and hobbies.

My problems with her are that I don't feel supported by her (I have gotten into photography recently and am aware that I'm an amateur, but she refers to me as a ""photographer"" and says that it's just a waste of money and so on); she can be very rude and unproductive in fights (name-calling, saying ""fuck you,"" things like that); and she in general has said things like how she isn't really attracted to me and things like that.

I have spoken with both of my therapists about this situation and they both seem to be behind me in making some real decisions here, whether that be couple's counseling or breaking up. My girlfriend is pretty averse to couple's counseling though, so I don't think that's an option.

If anyone out there can give me any advice, I would deeply appreciate it. I feel very lost here.

Update: She seems to not want to break up (we kind of talked about it last night, for roughly the dozenth time, and I'm not exaggerating) but she's also said some things that point toward wanting to break up. I'm even more confused now.

t2_3fpyiunp,1553710459.0,b67mh6,t3_b67mh6,79,"Hi guys. First time poster. On mobile. Sorry about the formatting etc. 

So let me throw in some backstory. I’m a junior in college and this girl is a year behind me. We’ve known each other since I was a junior in high school where we went to school together, so we’ve known each other for almost 5 years now and we’ve been best friends that whole time. 

Because of this, we were obviously very close. For a long time we would see and talk to each other every day. We’d gossip and spend the night together and for a while we were even planning on moving in together. (I should mention that I am gay, and am in no way attracted to her and I don’t believe she has feelings for me in that way, just so that doesn’t misdirect the advice I’m looking for). 

For reference in this story my best friends name in this will be Jordyn. All other names will be fake but the people and the stories are real. 

So when I met Jordyn she was single but she definitely didn’t stay that way long. She started dating a friend from school in our group of friends who’s name will be Carter. Jordyn and Carter dated for about 9 months, and for 6 of those months Jordyn was regularly having sex with Michael. Meanwhile Michael had been in a relationship for almost 6 months and had been cheating on her (she’ll be Amber) almost the entire time. 

I found out that Jordyn and Michael were cheating on there significant others, and because of certain circumstances I won’t go into, I had to live with Amber during the end my senior year of high school. Amber found out what was going on from me, which led to Carter finding out, which led to Jordyn wanting nothing to do with me and blaming me for getting her caught, and also led to Michael trying to kill himself. Big mega mess that by now has otherwise been resolved.

Jordyn and Carter broke up. Amber forgave Michael and they’re still together now. 

The problem is Jordyn started dating someone else 6 months later. Three months into that relationship she was cheating on him with Carter. Again I was the reason her boyfriend found out she was getting involved with someone else. This happened my freshman year of college while I was still close with my group of friends at that time. 

When she went to college, she came to the same school I am still at now because we’re both not super wealthy and it’s close enough to commute. She started dating this guy at our school and because he wasn’t super close with our friends I guess she thought she was in the clear because he wouldn’t find out. 

Jordyn recently celebrated her 19th birthday and in that same week a few days later, we went to a work party with a mutual friend that I was working with at the time. This friend will be Josselyn. Josselyn had a cousin who worked with us and I agree with Jordyn that he is very attractive. Him and Jordyn had a thing for each other and he was at the party and came with us to the bar that night. Afterwards they ended up at another coworkers house and had sex. I had gone home but found out from Josselyn what had happened. 

At the time Jordyn and her current boyfriend were “on a break” but being on a break means taking time to figure out whether or not you still want to be together, not using that time to sleep around. For a few days I stressed about it and decided that her boyfriend should know what she did. I didn’t talk to her about it first as she’s lied about it in the past and felt that if I consulted her first I wouldn’t ever get the chance to tell him again. 

After I told him, she unadded me on everything and didn’t say a word. Her and the guy are still together because she told him that she had sex with someone else but spun it to sound as if it was just because she was too drunk. I know she was sober and that she fully intended at the start of the night to have sex with him. She had begged Josselyn to take them to the coworkers house because she thought she had a shot with her cousin, she picked the lock on the car door so they could lay in the backseat of Josselyn’s car, and she specifically set out to have everyone leave (they went to Taco Bell and left Jordyn and Josselyn’s cousin alone) so they would have privacy and then proceeded to call her boyfriend while she was having sex with Josselyn’s cousin. 

When Jordyn unadded me and stopped talking to me I didn’t reach out and decided I didn’t need a friend like that and I felt I was better off without her. 

About a week ago she reached out and wanted to talk things over because she “wasn’t mad anymore.” We were friends for a long time and figured the least I owed her was time to talk. We met somewhere public and it seemed okay but I don’t think I should get involved in a friendship with her again. I told her that we always fight whenever I tell her boyfriends that she cheating and she always seems to feel the need to cheat. 

I’m now realizing how long this really is, and I’m very sorry. It ended up being a lot more than I originally thought it would be. But long story short, does anybody have any advice for me on this topic. I do care about her and want to see her be better and sometimes it seems like she’s making progress and then it blows up in my face and I’m left feeling guilty for her actions. 

For anyone who stuck around and read this whole thing please help me decide what to do. Do I give her another chance or is enough enough and just cut her off completely?

Edit: when I say she intended at the start of the night to have sex with him, I want to clarify that I know that intention didn’t change and that she actively was trying to get with him. Afterwards she was still all over him cuddling and making out with him, and proceeded to call her boyfriend to confirm her plans with him the next day. I’m say this because this level of lying and dissociation with reality is genuinely concerning to me as I’m starting to legitimately worry about her mental health.

t2_2xz5n0od,1553804815.0,b6nuqf,t3_b6nuqf,14,"I have always had a really hard time making friends. My siblings were constantly emotionally and verbally abusive. They would convince everyone I met that I was unworthy of friendship. I was then betrayed and unwittingly groomed for 4 years by a much older man I thought was my friend. I then was in an abusive relationship. I basically was taught no one would ever want to be around me. 

As I was trying to unlearn that I met my friend in grad school. We had so much in common. I was deeply infatuated with him as a person. My ex had convinced me I was asexual and I had never felt sexual feelings toward anyone including my friend. I just loved being around him. We spent all of our time together and truly acted like best friends. I told him things I've never told anyone. He told me that he had a gf. I decided that that just meant we were destined to be best friends. 

As our friendship grew, so did my feelings for him despite my best efforts. I had shared things with him I had never told anyone. I had said I wanted him to know me. He had said he never wanted to hurt me. He has told me, ""you meet someone and you have this great connection and you never connect with anyone and then you find out they have a gf and it sucks."" 

I talked to another friend about it and she didn't think I alone was at fault. He initiated every time we hungout. He would do things like sit so that he was touching me and then press his leg against mine. I constantly saw him stare at me when he thought I wouldn't notice. I was asked many times if we were dating. 

Eventually, he told me he wanted to get engaged to his gf. I got obviously upset and within the week had a dramatic talk with him about how he obviously doesn't mean to, but flirts with me sometimes and gives me the wrong impression, which is kind of cruel because he knew I liked him. I asked if we could rectify this behavior so we could be the friends we always should have been. He freaked out, said he never knew I liked him, that there was a new subtext to our friendship that made him uncomfortable, and that we couldn't be friends. He said we could be if I got a bf. 

Fast forward a couple months and I have a bf, who I love. My friend becomes friends with me again. He is supposed to tutor me for 1 hour. Instead we catch up for 6.5. We fall right back to where our friendship left off. I tell him how grateful I am for his friendship and how glad I am to be best friends again. He says the same about how much he's missed me. He cries for me when I tell him some other very bad very personal things that have happened to me during our friendship break. 

Fast forward to him telling me in the car on the way to a birthday dinner where he is 1/2 friends I have there that he doesn't believe that you can ever be friends with someone who has had feelings for you. He said he hated that people thought we had dated. He said he cared about me but could never be real friends with me. This absolutely broke my heart. I got into a fight with him and said I didn't mind him having bad feelings toward an acquaintance. 

I decided I didn't want to be friends at all with someone who cared so much less about me than I cared about him. I was so upset that after icing my friend out for a month our mutual friends, my bf and Guy1, convinced me to try and talk to my friend. Guy1 said he knew my friend was desperate to talk to me. I went up to my friend and he immediately said he had nothing to say to me. I sent him a long apology reiterating that I don't think we should be friends, but apologizing for acting like a child. No reply. Now I don't know how to act around our mutual friends when he's around. I've been avoiding them. What so I do? 

TL;DR! Am I responsible for ruining my friendship and is it wrong that my friend saying we could never be real friends hurt me so much?

t2_3hvup3ph,1553804634.0,b6ntgp,t3_b6ntgp,5,"Surprisingly the age difference hasn't been an issue!

(For story sake we'll call him John)

So I need to go back to the weird beginnings of this relationship.  We met at our local reddit meetup (which I've been doing frequently for like 6+ years), and I went home with him after a party that a mutual friend had.  Had a hilarious moment realizing the age difference and not even remembering each others names.  Had some of the best sex I've ever had in my life etc etc.

-----

We did not start dating when this happened but we did start a bit of a friends with benefits thing.  He had just moved here from another country - I got that.  I was just happy to have more of that amazing sex.  Seriously I was deprived of great sex in my life jesus-fucking-christ-on-a-biscuit you have no idea.  So from within the local reddit scene there is another cute girl, I'll call her Peggy.  John had a thing for Peggy but Peggy knew he had slept with me and didn't want to shake anything up with me though I said I'd be cool with anything - we're not dating.  Still she was adamant she didn't want to do anything with him.  John was apparently a little bit pushy on the flirty aspect with her and he did make a bit of a fool of himself on more than one occasion.

And then apparently, something did happen.   Both of them got drunk and went back to her place and had sex.  And again in the morning.  To my understanding everything was consensual.  And this is where things get weird.  She held off on telling me that anything happened because she didn't want me to be mad or hurt by her (despite me telling her I wouldn't be mad - seriously I'm pretty sex positive I do not care).  By telling me and everyone that she was adamant about not wanting to sleep with him and then sleeping with him and saying she didn't want to until they were both drunk made it seem to everyone that John took advantage of her while drunk.

Then UNCONFIRMED while Peggy wasn't home a neighbor said someone was banging on her door one night in the middle of the night.  No one stated what they saw or who it was but for some reason everyone assumed it was John.  John denies this was him and I believe him because this would be out of character behavior for him.

-----

THEN I found out I got Chlamydia (which I initially thought was a bad UTI).  This was a thing.  This was my first time ever getting an STD.  I knew I wasn't the first contact so I turned to John, John turned to Peggy, Peggy turned to John.  This was a thing.  John keeps accusing Peggy of giving it to him.  Peggy is adamant she didn't.  I basically told him it doesn't matter who passed it to who, shit happens just get tested.  Just STOP.  Stop being children.

They both get tested.  John has it.  Peggy surprisingly doesn't and thinks the probiotics she was taking prevented it.

John never did apologize to Peggy for accusing her (I don't think he did) but they just don't talk.

----------------------------------------

Time passes and I still hang out with John.  He lives around the corner from me basically and we just get closer.  Despite the age difference we are on the same level.  We discover that we have amazing chemistry together, start exploring each other a bit, it's been a great time.  At the same time, he's been there for me on an emotional level.  I had some ridiculous car issues and work issues and he's been there for me.

When I've sent a text about my supervisors being a bag of dicks and get a text saying that when I get done work he'd give me a full body massage...and he does.  And it's like...magic.  Like what did I do to deserve this?

So John takes a hiatus from the meetups and I still go for awhile and then I take a bit of a break due to my own personal issues.  He comes out again and he's with me most of the night and talking to this other guy about music when I get a msg from another mutual friend - Adam.  Adam sends me a message on our Discord server that people complained saying they don't feel comfortable with John being there.  I'm like ""He literally sat with me all night and talked to this new guy about music all night.""    


I will admit...Everything about the beginning of our relationship was weird af and what happened between him and Peggy was awkward af BUT I'm willing to move past that because I've gotten to know this guy.  He's actually pretty great, despite stubborn at times.  We ended up actually getting together and are planning to go visit his home country in the summer.  He's excited for me to see everything from his country and everything.  MAYBE a trip to Euro Disney but that's a couple countries over or so.  

  
Time goes on and I take a longer hiatus from the meetups, which I use to go to EVERY week.  I hate not going but I'm realizing that I'm literally stuck between choosing between my friends and now my boyfriend.  One of them has a birthday thing coming up and I'm literally not allowed to invite John because people feel uncomfortable about the past.

However, we have absolutely nothing in common. I realized a while ago but now it's starting to take a toll. We don't like the same music, she doesn't game at all, I like math and engineering and she thinks it's all boring, I like to go out with my friends but she just wants to stay in unless we go somewhere cool like downtown and only sometimes then. Our only common ground is we like the some of the same genres of TV shows/movies. Even in the bedroom we have nothing in common I like to be dominant and kinky but she's just sooo vanilla( she had a imperferated hymen and needed surgery so that might have something to do with it) . A little about her, she has really bad anxiety, worse than she will admit and with that comes depression, she comes from a religious family and she never stands up to get parents and caters to them but doesn't really care to me, she's religious as well. My girlfriend doesn't have that many friends and one moved states away for school. I have tons in common with her friends though, they're open about everything in front of me. I don't get how she didn't end up like her friends. So, basically... I need advice!

He screams, breaks things, frightens me and our child. Every so often I ""convince"" him to go to counseling. He will go once or twice and then quit, as if everything is better. He does the classic gaslight ingredients and blaming me for how he treats me. If I so much as express that I have been hurt he flies into a fit of rage and destroys the room before taking off in his car.  
He is not jealous or possessive. In fact I am convinced that not only does he not love me, but he indeed hates me. I think he was too emotionally immature when we got together, and still is. We have been together 10 years and have a small child. I think he does not recognize that we should split up for all our sakes. He says that he doesn't want to end it.
I am certain he is mentally ill, and he screams that he is. He often uses that as an excuse for being abusive. But in public or with friends he has complete control over his behaviour. He only acts cruel at home.  
I am not the same person I was when I was younger. My spirit is crumbling. I have been a stay-at-home at home mom since the birth of our child, so I have no job, no car, no money of my own.

If someone other than me confronts him he is likely to act calmly and leave for a few days.

Well, we stayed friends on social media and we used to chat a couple times a month. Then in December of 2018, he sent me this long message that he had never stopped thinking of me, was an idiot, and wanted to try again. It seemed so sincere, so I gave him a chance. Well, 3 months later, I'm regretting it. It took us a little over 2 months to even hang out for the first time, and then we did for 3 weeks in a row before he didn't see me last weekend. We still are talking everyday, but sometimes lately it seems he's taking longer to reply, like this last time he went 17hrs without opening my message. Yet, he was definitely awake. He usually sends me good morning messages, but he didn't today.
Now, he's saying he isn't sure if he can this weekend either, after telling me last week that we were just skipping that weekend. So, to me, it's pretty clear that he's lying, because I've asked him if he was really still interested etc. All the time, he tells me he is, he's just busy, blah blah. And I almost feel like he borders into gaslighting me by telling me that I'm essentially overthinking everything and we're fine, even though I've been noticing things were off.
Also, it took him over 17 hours to look and reply to my last message, which was about hanging out, and he said he'd ""let me know"". As if MY time isn't important. I'd like to know if I should keep my schedule open or not. Then, I realize that if I made other plans, he wouldn't even care. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point, because I know he actually is having it rough. But this is also not acceptable to me. Can anyone just please tell me that I'm not being crazy or unfair here? That I would be making the right move to end it if he can't make time for me this weekend? Also, I haven't even responded to his message yet, about not being sure if he can do this weekend. I am upset with him and want to go off, but I also want to wait to see if he will make the time or not before I tell him off. Should I tell him that if he doesn't see me, it's over?

For some context, I’ve been a relationship (with different people) for around the past 7 years, I haven’t really “dated” much. I got out of my last relationship in December of last year

I have been currently seeing a former friend and classmate of over a year (who I had a minor crush on) for the past few months, but I’ve soon come to realise that he might not be the one for me. He’s very overly affectionate, always wants to be around me (I’m an introvert) and constantly offering to do everything for and pay for everything. This is what initially attracted me, especially since he asked me out on Valentines Day, and I realise this sounds like the ideal man for some, which means I can’t give him a reason that he wasn’t paying enough attention. 

Its also dangerously veered into “relationship” territory. He’s often kept an extra towel at his place “just for me” and has left his toothbrush at mine. I’ve also been going through a mild depressive period (due to switching to a different BC pill) and I’ve been prone to spontaneous fits of crying, which has often happened when we’re together at night and he’s initiating sex, damaging his self esteem further. 
He’s been as kind as he can to take care of me and being there for me, but has also started offering to take me out to (expensive) meals and telling him that he can only be happy as long as I am (his words)- which again ends up putting a lot of pressure on me to appear happy. 

I’ve tried to have a conversation with him to back off and not put pressure a few times but it doesn’t seem to have gone through, hence the reason I might have to break it off. However, since we are classmates- we see each nearly everyday and live around 5 minutes away from each other that makes it even harder to deal with. He’s also mentioned how he can only be truly sad if I break up with him which makes me feel even more devastated to break up with him. 

So my question is, should I break up with him (because my brain is too addled with the depressive episode) and if so- what’s the kindest way to let him down after he’s done so much for me?

They’ve been going out for about a month and a half and although I (M19) am happy for him (and actually helped him procure the relationship)  I can’t help but feel I’m slowly being pushed to the side as they’re relationship progresses. I used to play video games with him all the time and we’d hang out in person at least once a week. Now though I find myself constantly trying to at the very least get him to talk to me. I realize that as a relationship begins there is the honeymoon faze between the two people, of always wanting to be with that other person but, it seems to me that he just does not have a need for me anymore. I normally wouldn’t have a problem with finding a new friend to get close with but I’m a very introverted person and I don’t want to just throw away 4yrs of friendship with him. I’ve had friends in the past who’ve I witnessed this same phenomenon with but it was easy transitioning to a more acquaintance like friendship, this however, is ducking me up because I don’t know what to do, with the person in question being my bestfriend. 

So my question for Reddit is do I accept that fact that he’s moving on without me and move on myself, or do I fight to stay relevant even if our friendship is  already going the way of the samurai.

I'm not entirely sure where to post this, so please let me know if it belongs somewhere else.

This all happened about a year ago, a girl, let's call her Lilly, I had been friends with and I had gotten into an argument, a big one. Through some digging I managed to find the old screen shots, the screen shots I won't be posting seen as they are partially in my native language, and I had a semi embarrassing phone background.

Lilly is the kind of 'friend' that likes to be around people that are popular/ make her feel popular, and would mostly text me when she was having problems again or was feeling sad. I can understand that you will occasionally feel bad or have problems with your parents etc., hell I probably have a medal in complaining by this point, but to just text me for that or to hear about how amazing your new poem is, is just pretty shitty, and wasn't exactly a great feeling. So whenever she texted me I would already be annoyed.

We were in classes together, but my best friend and another friend, friend 1, were in a different one, so I had to deal with her the most, and she didn't really spend any time with them anymore except when she happened to see them. Though more with friend 1 because we had a joined math class, best friend had a different kind of maths.

For some added context, these particular texts happened when I was spending time with my best friend to celebrate her birthday. Now let's get into these dramatic texts.

Lilly: OP, happy easter. (First text she sended me that day, this is important later.)

Me: Thanks, happy easter.

Lilly: I am happy on my own so here I'll stay, save your loving arms for a rainy day, and I'll find my comfort in my pain. (note, I have absolutely no idea why she said this.)

Lilly: Thank you, can I ask you a weird question?

Me: I'm with other people right now.

Lilly: It is an easy question but I will ask it another time.

Lilly: This is so weird, I still fit in my dresses from five years ago.

Me: I sure as hell wouldn't be able to either.

Lilly: I thought I wasn't going to fit in that dress either.

Lilly: Still visiting?

Me: Yes

Lilly: Family?

Me: No the friend that wishes you a happy easter too. (My best friend who hadn't gotten a text from her.)

Lilly: (Best friend)?!

Lilly: Can I ask your opinion about a dress?

Lilly: It is a funny colour.

Lilly: Can you wish that friend a happy easter?!

Me: She said (middle finger emoji).

Lilly: (sad/hurt emojis.)

Lilly: But can I?

Me: sure.

Lilly: (proceeds to send pictures of her in a dress that was pretty tight, definitely not fitting her like a nice fitting dress should.)

Me: meh.

Me: The colour isn't funny, it's just mint.

Lilly: (more sad/ emojis)

Lilly: I really like it.

Me: Okay.

Lilly: Your opinion is really important, what don't you like about it?

Me: Idk.

Lilly: The colour? The shape? The fact that it's a dress? The person that's wearing it? (Attention seeking alert.)

Me: Idk.

Lilly: (even more sad/ hurt emojis)

Lilly: Your opinion is really important.

Me: Okay.

Lilly: Mind looking at another?

Me, just wanting this to end so I can stop texting her: Okay.

Lilly: (sends a picture of another dress that didn't fit her properly)

Me: Does not fit.

Lilly: I can put straps on it.

Lilly: It does fit.

Me: No, there is fit, and there is fit, you fit in it but your body does not fit the proportions. (Five years ago at that moment we were all about eleven or twelve, we at least grew a little in height, and grew in our hips, chest, and thighs, her not fitting into it shouldn't have been such a big deal because it is completely normal.)

Lilly: OP stop.

Me: You asked for my opinion?

Lilly: Yes I did.

Me: Then?

Lilly: (sends another picture of her in the dress, now with the straps.)

Me: Still does not fit.

Lilly: You are the only one saying that.

Me: Maybe I'm the only one being honest.

Me: You asked for my opinion don't get mad at me for giving it.

Lilly: Not nice.

Lilly: I could ask a boy.

Me: then ask a boy.

Lilly: (I assume she was referring to the being honest here) It can't be because he loves me so he would look nice no matter what. (I don't know either what her point was.)

Lilly: I already asked my dad and he said yes.

Me: Look, it's my opinion, if you don't like it because it's negative and honest don't ask for it.

Lilly: No!

Lilly: Why doesn't it fit? Because I am too chubby?

Me: Girl you ain't chubby.

Lilly: I am.

Me: (a bunch of annoyed emojis.)

Lilly: I am really.

Me: No, I am chubby.

Lilly: Yes.

Me: And I fucking love being chubby so don't go saying being chubby is bad. (Weight used to be/ is an issue for me, so this subject was a little bit sensitive.)

Lilly: I didn't say it was bad.

Me: And it doesn't fit because, I don't know if you know this, but your body gets wider and fuller when you grow up because it is biologically getting ready for child bearing.

Me: And you literally did.

Lilly: Perhaps you are wrong.

Me: Then don't ask for my opinion.

Lilly: Okay, then I won't.

Lilly: I will stop writing.

Me: Okay.

Lilly: Because I won't need your help anymore.

Me: K.

Lilly: That is freaking rude.

Me: Idc.

Lilly: Did you ever?

Me: I've seriously tried to support you as much as I fucking could so don't give me this cryptic shit because there is only so much I can take before I am done.

Lilly: Go ahead, fire away, you guys are all the same.

Me: seriously.

Lilly: Yes, for a brief moment I thought you were more like me.

Me: It's time to stop blaming others and start looking at your own faults.

Lilly: Haha.

Me: seriously.

Lilly: Bye.

Me: Yeah bye.

Me: Just leave me.

Me: Like you did to a bunch of other people.

Lilly: You don't have any right to judge me I never did with you.

Me: I'm not fucking judging you. (Maybe I was a little, but I was upset and annoyed and didn't really care much, she had crossed a line with me.)

Lilly: You are.

Lilly: You judge me just because I walked away but you don't know what happened.

Me: You literally left (best friend) and kinda (friend 1) and (friend 2) (a friend that was in our class).

Me: Want me to judge you?

Me: Fine.

Lilly: I didn't, I never left them.

Me: You use people as long as they are use-full and convenient to you and then drop them.

Lilly: I don't.

Me: Yeah, you do.

Lilly: You perhaps but not me.

Me: Are you fucking kidding me! When?!

Lilly: You are twisting my words.

Me: How the fuck am I twisting your words?

Lilly: You said you wanted... car.... without.... caring.... leaving... behind....

Me: What?!

Lilly: Forgot?

Me: I have no fucking clue what you are talking about.

Lilly: Remember when I wanted to walk away.

Me: I was literally worried out of my mind and going crazy and all you did was laugh. (She hadn't even walked away, her definition of walking away was going on a walk through her town, and her laughing did not sound nervous at all.)

Lilly: Those were nerves and you know that.

Me: sure.

Lilly: I called you.

Lilly: You said you... car... sad.... not caring.... who was left behind.

Me: I never did that.

Me: You say that I am twisting your words but you are twisting mine.

Lilly: I am not I remember that loud and clear.

Me: Good for you.

Me: I thought you were leaving.

Lilly: I didn't leave (best friend) and (friend 1), I still talk to them.

Lilly: And (friend 2) you haven't got a clue what is going on.

Lilly: So before judging you could have at least asked for my side of the story.

Me: This coming from (best friend), she does think you left her.

Lilly: Well I didn't and she could talk to me herself.

Lilly: Just because she thinks I did doesn't have to mean I did.

Lilly: I talked to (best friend) a few days ago I asked her where she was so we could sit together but she had already left.

Me: Because it was convenient for you to be with her at that time.

Lilly: No.

Lilly: Because I wanted to be with her at that moment because she and I are friends.

Me: She doesn't think so.

Lilly: Well that was the reason.

Me: Then why did you not wish her a happy easter? Or ask her opinion about the dress? Or literally almost never talk to her unless I am not giving you the attention you want?!

At this time she had texted my best friend about all this, and mentioned something about how this was bound to happen.

Me: And by the way, how was this bound to happen?

Lilly: I didn't wish anyone a happy easter only you and (dude I didn't know).

Me: Well then why did you wish me a easter and not others?

Me: Also you are ignoring my points for your convenience.

Lilly: Because I was talking to you.

Lilly: I am talking to her I even wished her a happy Bday.

Me: No, you just randomly said happy easter while we hadn't talked earlier today.

Me: And wishing someone a happy birthday is such a chore, how good of you to remember that for someone who was there for you for like three years.

Lilly: I meant the dress.

Me: What?

Me: are you seriously throwing a tantrum because I did not tell you you looked good in a dress you had on five fucking years ago?!

Me: That is just fucking petty.

Lilly: Not five years ago.

Lilly: I talked to her.

Me: You said it was five years ago.

Lilly: That was another dress.

Me: Okay?

Me: that's nice for you?

Me: I'm allowed to have my own opinion and if you don't like it then it's not my problem.

Me: Because **you** asked me.

Me: So I gave it.

Me: Then you're upset.

Me: I'm not going to lie about it when you ask my opinion like that, welcome to the real world.

Me: It's not all rose petals and sunshine.

Me: And if you prefer honesty so much then don't get upset when I am being honest.

Lilly: Haha, you are one to talk.

Me: Or lie about being sick in a test week when you can still walk the dog, be online the entire day, or clean your room.

Lilly: You only want the beauty not the beast, but there is no beauty without the beast.

Lilly: I was ill and my parents want me to walk the dog when I am ill so I get some fresh air.

Me: I have put up with all your talk about your problems! All your attention seeking! All your trying to be emo! All you wanting to ask me what's wrong and then not saying it.

Lilly: I am not.

Me: **DO NOT FUCKING TELL ME I ONLY WANTED THE BEAUTY NOT THE BEAST BECAUSE ALL I AM FUCKING NOTICING IS THE BEAST**

Me: And don't use cryptic shit or quotes, use your own words.

Lilly: I talk to you because we are friends and I care about you, I talk to you because your opinion is important to me, I talk to you because I like spending time with you.

Me: It shows how high you value my opinion and friendship when somedays you will randomly be upset with me.

Lilly: No that ain't true.

Me: Or get upset when I say I don't like a dress.

Me: Or always ask someone else after asking me.

Me: Or doing the exact opposite after asking my advice.

Lilly: You and I know it wasn't about that dress.

Lilly: And what do I do that with?

Me: Everything.

Me: And if it isn't, then please elaborate.

Lilly: We both knew it was going to happen anytime soon.

Lilly: The fight.

Me: **WE DID FUCKING NOT**

Me: I've been there for you so much, but fine.

Me: Pretend I wasn't.

Lilly: Remember my notebook.

Lilly: The little one.

Me: Stop saying remember this, remember that.

Me: It's annoying.

Lilly: Nah.

Me: K. Then not.

Lilly: Stop talking behind my back.

Me: I'm talking to you.

Lilly: And behind my back.

Me: Stop acting like a baby throwing a tantrum.

Me: And if you thought we'd have a fight it says more about you then about me.

Lilly: Well it was time, it always is, so yeah, I wasn't really surprised.

Me: Also you're talking behind my back so stop giving points that are crap.

Me: And how is it time?

Me: Seriously, you've had lots of fights with lots if people, maybe it's not their fault.

Me: Maybe, just maybe, the world isn't against you.

Me: Maybe you're making it like that.

Lilly: Just because I wasn't sure I already thought we were going to have a fight.

Me: But instead I'm fighting with you.

Lilly: How should I know? Wasn't invited, wasn't told,

Me: It was family and me.

Lilly: How am I supposed to know if she didn't tell me.

Me: Stop making that about yourself.

Lilly: I just said how am I supposed to know something if someone didn't tell me.

Me: I did tell you I was visiting her.

Me: I just fucking pointed it out don't go whine about it.

Lilly: Just now yes.

Lilly: Yes you told me **today**.

Me: Not just now.

Lilly: Today, whatever.

Lilly: Forget that I have a lot on my mind.

Me: You always have 'a lot on your mind.'

Lilly: It is the truth.

Me: Don't use it as an excuse.

Lilly: It is the truth.

Lilly: But you know what happened last year.

Me: No I don't.

Me: Is this about your grandma dying?

Me: I'm going to take the silence as a yes.

Me: **THAT IS THE STUPIDEST REASON EVER**

Me: **DON'T USE HER FUCKING DEATH AS AN EXCUSE**

Me: That's just disrespectful to her.

Lilly: I never said it was

Me: Then wtf is it.

Me: If you won't tell me, then fine.

Me: But don't plan on me wanting to talk to you if you can't even give me a reason.

Me: You act like you are soooo depressed and sad and need approval.

Me: Well we all do.

Me: You go be a special little snowflake because you won't keep friends this way.

Lilly: I hadn't had any before.

Me: Hadn't had any what? Depressed feelings?

Me: Well here's a little lesson.

Lilly: OP go away.

Me: If you act like you are 'depressed', you'll start to believe it.

Me: And depression isn't just being sad.

Me: By the way you're the one that wanted to leave.

Me: Sorry you can't handle the truth, I'll go away.

Lilly: Like I don't freaking know that!!

Me: Don't come to me next time you have problems.

Lilly: I surely won't.

Me: Depression isn't just about being sad btw.

Lilly: I know that!!!

Me: It's about not having a lot of feelings.

Me: Sure you do.

Lilly: I know that. Yes.

Me: If you are depressed then get some help.

Me: Don't come whining to me when you have problems, get actual fucking help.

Lilly: I? Maybe you should

Me: From a psychologist.

And then she blocked me.

Now was I out of line for some of the things I said? Probably at least a little, but I have some people close to me that deal with it, so to see it misused like that really ticks me off. And if she does have depression then she shouldn't have been expecting me to fix it or help if she never even hints at it.

Even reading all this back gets me annoyed.

After this I ignored her for a long time, throwing away all the notes she wrote me, until one day I was kinda done with it and said I just wanted an apology and I could start forgiving her.

She apologised, and I did indeed forgave her, big mistake, because not even a year later she fucked up again, apologised, and I forgave her again. I'm a push over.

I cannot wait for high school to be over so that I never have to see her again.

t2_172yeo,1553788405.0,b6khmf,t3_b6khmf,2,"Hello,

I (22M) have some problems dating this girl S (23F) and here is our story:

We met in June 2018, during a university summer course on a campus many hours away from both of our home cities where we knew nobody (which are not the same, by the way). From the first night, we clicked. Everything was perfect from the get go and and I think it took two or three nights before my campus apartment could be considered abandoned and so it went for about a month+. We got very serious and kept talking about keeping everything going even after the course was over because of how much we liked eachother.

Worth mentioning is that she has family in the city I live and after the course and housing in the remote city ended, plus a couple of weeks apart from eachother in July because of work trips abroad, we started seeing eachother in my home city, however, things were not the same. We had talked during most of the time apart, but not all. We met a few time both at my place and her family's (I had met her mother) as well as outside around the city, often going for a walk to talk about what is going on and what is going to be.

Another important part of this is that being my home city, I knew other people. There absolutely was none I had ever met like S, but sure there are others. I did not have anything defined or serious with anyone, however, there was one girl I had been kind of close to for a long time when I met S and we were still in contact(on the phone) during the month with S and she(not S) wanted us to become serious. She, girl of my home town, had wanted this for a long time but I have always said no. Anyway, this story is not about her. I obviously let them know about eachother and I suppose that's where it went south together with the time apart. I tried to make it work with S, telling her I wanted everything we had talked about and she agreed but things felt off. She didn't want to tell me personal things anymore, she could often just be quite instead of responding to questions and didn't want to show her face on pictures etc. 

Being in the end of July, some relevant events were coming up in August. First one being her birthday, second one being home universities starting up meaning she would leave my city to live far away, meaning we would not meet much more than maybe a weekend or two per month. This was what I was thinking about and probably she too. I tried to meet her as much as possible to talk and make her get back to the super happy, funny and outgoing person she was just a couple of weeks ago, that was making me/us fall in love. I tried many ways to get her activated (different activities, questions, gifts, whatever) but she did not. This is where I made the decision that I now regret because of the consequences. I decided we were not happening (she surely didnt seem to want it too much anymore) and did not join her birthday celebration she had invited me to, at a hotel in a neighbouring city (she was there with all of her family and some friends). After this, things kept on breaking down. We soon lost contact and I was pretty sad about it. Tried with some phone calls but her holding back just got worse over time.

During autumn and winter, two things happened. One is that I spent more and more time with the girl I had known for long, after a while even deciding to try for a relationship and move in together in her apartment. During this relationship we didn't ever find a way to make it great. I guess I should have known, since I had held her away for 1 and a half year at this point but then just let it happen as an alternative. She definitely noticed and often asked about my thought about S. I wasn't too comfortable talking about it. I didn't find it appropriate. Mind you, there were very definitely good times between us, but also pretty bad ones spent mostly fighting over things, not getting along. The other thing that happened actually happened twice. It was that S tried to contact me, or that's what she calls it. I thought a lot about my time with her when we were apart, but even more when she wrote. The problem was that I was convinced she didn't want to make us work except during the summer that we had and what she wrote did not indicate much else. She wrote in the middle of the night, once asking ""Can I ask you for some advice?"" to which I said ""yes"" the morning after and in return got a ""Nevermind. I just had too many drinks"". The other time being at new year's eve, also late and after some drinks. This time was different. She wrote right out that she wanted to see me. I was super excited, yet sceptical. I asked why and she said I probably know. She offered to talk about things sometime in person and I agreed that we should. I was still in the not-so-good relationship and I told my gf right away about S Writing, showed her the messages and added that I actually wanted to know what she wanted to tell me. Gf proceeded to concact S to ""make sure you didnt already meet"" (gf had been abroad for a couple of weeks over new years). We hadn't met, so apart for being unhealthy controlling and uncomfortable by gf and for S, things were fair. After their conversation, S wrote to me that she had heard from gf(this is how I got to know about their call) and said she was sorry she contacted me. End of story for a few weeks. 

Gf goes for another trip and a few days in, she decides to break up with over text. I was pretty shocked because I didn't think anything major had happened at the time. We had been together for many months now and there I was, alone in our/her apartement while she was traveling. She told me she didn't think I loved her as she loved me and that she never wanted to see me again because that would make it hard for her. I asked her a lot what was going on but just packed my things, met her to talk about it once she got back, in a try to make me understand, then left. She didn't last long before she tried to talk to me and get us back but I wasn't into it. I had realized it really wasn't good and that I indeed had been thinking about someone else, specifically S. I went solo for a few weeks  then decided there is no reason to wait and contacted S.

Today, we have been in talked for a month and met both in my and her home city. She is mostly back to the summer girl I thought she was and I am infinitely happy to see and talk to her all the time. My overall mood really goes up now that she is (kind of) around. We talk daily and most of the time I think we are going to last forever. It really feels to me like I have grown feelings for her ever since we first met and at this point I know she is the one for me. There are two problems with my hopes/plans, though:

1. She is still holding back a bit. She says she is insecure after trying so much last summer but being left by me and she does not understand why I didn't respond better to her tries of reaching me during autumn/winter. She thinks she really tried but I denied her and decided someone else to be my 1st choice. The times of her holding back is when I talk about future or personal stuff and around meeting her friends/family.
2. She has spread her view on me at the end of summer to all of her family and friends and it is bad. A lot of her friends at uni and around think I am the worst person on earth for her since I didn't make it work the first time and they are really really pushing that onto her, almost daily. Obviously she don't want to lose her friends and I don't want her to either.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not looking to be shamed by you because of my decision to be in a relationship without love. I sincerely wish I had not, since it has really hurt me over time. Please try to be kind about it and help me out with the girl I am in love with if you have some advice.

What I'm wondering here is how to get further with this, as a long distance relationship? How can I help her commit or at least not hold back? How can I lower the influence of her friends, that really really makes her insecure about me every now and then (even though I manage to get her back on saying she wants me/us pretty soon afterwards, they come back and are many. I don't know how long I can convince her over and over and over)? Or at least convince her friends to let her give us a try? Is it possible/normal to get back together and make it work?

I have tried to explain as well as I can but am glad to add edits/comments explaining other things. Also, if I added too much, please tell me so I can make the text shorter. I don't post much and English isn't my best.

We hadn't spoken or seen each other in this time and I had been finding myself increasingly more tempted to message her just to catch up. There was no romantic intention, just a desire to find out how she was getting on, what she had been doing etc. We had been together around 18 months before breaking up in a fairly mutual way and while we obviously weren't best pals after I didn't feel there was any bad blood and I didn't get the vibe she felt any either.

&amp;#x200B;

I sent a casual message asking if she fancied catching up with one another but she shut me down immediately! She said she had moved on with her life and has no interest in speaking to me at all. So besides the obvious rejection I'm finding it really hard to understand why she reacted in this way when I feel so intrigued and excited at the prospect of finding out about the last two years of her life. Am I naive to think she'd still be wondering about me as I am with her? Am I missing something?  Would anyone be able to explain or describe her mindset on this?

However ,I've noticed from like around Christmas time that he keeps asking me to buy him things. The first few times he said it i actually thought he was playing because he said it so bold , almost commanding me...in a nice way. Then times after that it would be so weird, because he would say it out of nowhere, like ""oh your in that store... buy me this and that"" ... wth . I'm not a cheap person but I am a bit selfish, and frankly I don't appreciate people telling when or what to buy , whatever I buy should be my decision and on my own time. 

He always wants me to buy him some new video game or clothes. He will show me some game or TV or console on Amazon. He even wants shirts or shoes from Nike or Adidas. 

BTW , we have never bought each other anything, expect for Christmas , but it's mainly because I'm generally uncomfortable with people buying me things unless its like the holidays. ADDITIONALLY, he works , and I dont. His family has a pretty decent amount of money and as I just mentioned HE WORKS, i mean if you want something that bad , how about YOU buy it, he has the money to do so. I dont go to school now because of my busy schedule and im a paid intern at a company . Currently i pay off for everything with inheritance money, and im pretty spoiled so my parents too.

So yesterday Cindy decided to break up with me, and that i could understand and relate to. Its the reasoning and the way she did it does not compute. She is upstairs packing the house we bought together (her stuff).

two nights ago me and her had a heated discussion/argument about her wanting to go back to a job from right when we met. It is a small bakery for very low wages and no benefits. I am very strongly against that idea not because of the money or benefits really, but it still weighs in. my large concern was about going backwards in life not growing as a person just finding a basic comfort zone or rut. That was the final straw for her. 


Her reasoning is that she didnt know if she could be an ""adult"". Life is overwhelming with her job (major companies call center) the hardest part for me to understand is that she never told me. I found out she was having breakdowns in the shower that i didnt know about them. Her reasoning for not telling me was because she thought she was being a childish millennial. She said its on her for poorly communicating to me what she wanted and needed. 

All i want to do is have her back and help her through things. I dont want her to be alone i want to give her love and support. She wants nothing to do with us as a relationship.

About a week later, I told her I liked her more than a friend and we kissed when we were both drunk. Two weeks in and now we're dating and having sex.

I think it may of been a mistake because now I get irritated spending time with her and preferred it when we were friends. It might just be because suddenly its like we're a couple living together and skipped the whole dating and girlfriend thing.

I'm not sure what to do now, I don't want to hurt her feelings by telling her I just want to be friends again and I'm worried it wouldn't be the same if we went back. Should I carry on with the relationship and give it another chance? Or maybe I should tell her I just need some space?

So, the title pretty much says it all. I am really sad and just kinda need advice I guess on how to move on. Back around the 2nd week of February me and my boyfriend went on a ""break"". During this time his ex-girlfriend reached out to him and next thing you know they have sex. He told me about this, I dealt with it and moved on. We have been in the process of reconciling over the past few weeks when she tells him this week that she is pregnant with his baby. I asked how far along she is and all he told me was ""about a month"". A few weeks ago she called him and ""pranked"" him saying that she was pregnant and he was like well its not mine because it was only about 2 weeks since they hooked up. Anyway... both me and some other mutual friends think that she may just be saying that she is pregnant to trap him and keep him around. She went off the deep end when me and him first started dating because he cut her out of his life to focus on our relationship.

Anywho... We broke up and I am heartbroken. Any chance of us having a future together is gone and it makes me really sad. We got into an explosive argument the morning after he told me and we exchanged some not so nice things that were really hurtful and made things worse. I honestly hope that she isn't pregnant, not because I would get back with him anyway, but because I know that she already has a 2 year old she can barely afford to take care of and my ex has a 4 year old that he is paying almost all of his paycheck to support.

In the beginning, he told me that he wanted to be friends with benefits which I was fine with because I was really busy. However, we soon became pretty close and it morphed into an open relationship. He has broken things off we me before because he's gotten closer to other women I suppose. We didn't end on good terms because I felt the way he ended things was kind of disrespectful.

So why would I want to reach out to him? There is part of me that misses him but a larger part of me that worries about him. He has a lot of stuff going on in his life (roommate issues, family issues, issues with his PhD program, etc). He also struggles with mental illness which he is treating with medication and therapy. Really dark stuff was said to me including contemplating suicide.

t2_3hqgzray,1553799420.0,b6mr29,t3_b6mr29,1,"I met my gf back in August 2016, we clicked quite quickly and we liked each other almost instantly. When i met her she mentioned she lived in a nearby city to mine, an about 1h drive. This limited us to seeing each other about 1 day a week at most, usually fridays or saturdays because our schedules didn't match. 

There are some great things in our relationship and things i love about here:

* I find her ridiculously beautiful and attractive.

* She's not wasteful with money and neither am I.

* We get along well and can easily talk to the other.

* We have amazing sex when we have it.

There are some other things i really don't like though and this is why I'm making this post:

* We spend most of the week away from the other, so when I try to make plans in a way that I can include us having some intimate time during saturdays, she sometimes will start saying that I only care about sex. She then often tries to shame me for wanting to have sex with her and considering it something important/a priority. I dont prioritize it over other activities, I just try to make space for it because it's good and I like it.

* We almost exclusively see each other in my house or go out in my city because there's zero privacy in her house because she doesn't have her own room and her mom is *always* around.

* In order to see me weekly, during saturdays or any day pretty much, she has to have a reason other than *seeing me* to see me. So she always has to be giving excuses to her mom or lying to her so that we can see each other.

* She's particularly insecure about me looking at other women. For example, I used to freely follow and like pics of some people on instagram, from friends of mine to a few models. I wouldn't really care if she did the same with male models, but she got really jealous and started following all the women I follow. Including old classmates, my cousin, etc. I found this a little bit uncomfortable. I understood her discomfort though, so I unfollowed all the models I used to follow (less than 5), after all, looking at this content is a waste of time in my opinion.

* She's going to finish uni in 2 years, I'll be done in like 4 or 5 months and I plan to move to another country, where we live is not really a good place to live or work and most of my family live and are from where i want to go. And I feel like a long distance relationship is not going to work out.

(Also, I happen to have an IBD and my meds cost ~1k USD per dose every 15 days, which my local government pays for but not forever. It's a very corrupt government and I'm really lucky to have been able to get it for a certain amount of time but I need to be sure that I won't lack this medicine in the future. Where my family lives I can get it with a government subsidy that is more reliable than the one here.)

Anyway, overall, I don't really know what to do, I feel like these problems kind of make it really hard to see myself with her in the future for like forever. I want your opinion r/relationships, what can I do?

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried searching but i'm not completely familiar with the terms I need to search for.

We've bought a 1930's house in the UK and the room with the toilet in has a hole that goes to the outside wall (I assume for smell ventilation). We've had the house rewired and the electrician put in an inline fan which draws air from the ceiling  through the loft space and vented out underneath the exterior roof section (TLDR; We don't need the ventilation hole anymore).

&amp;#x200B;

I've spoken with various tradespeople about how to fill it and most of them suggest expanding foam. This seems an OK idea as the products say they insulate very well (it has to cover a brick cavity wall type wall). It seems like a lot of foam for one single area.

Is it best to brick it up instead? Or is expanding foam fine?

Gap measured 28cm wide by 20cm tall and approximately 30cm+ deep (forgot to measure the depth)

&amp;#x200B;

Any pointers/comments would be really appreciated, I want to get better at DIY but also don't want to mess it up.

Thanks

The master bath has the exhaust hose just laying on top of some insulation. While it’s running, I don’t feel any airflow at all coming through. 1) I assume there should be some flow to be felt?

The guest bath fan has no hose connected to it at all and was blowing into a pile of insulation. I wasn’t able to check it for air flow. 

2) can the two of these vented through one roof vent, or do they need to be separate?  They’re only about 6’ apart.

3) our roof is only about 6 months old, so I don’t know that I want to be the one to drill holes through it. If I were to outsource this, is it a job for a general contractor or electrician or what?

My husband is very family oriented and he refuses to cut her from his life. She has put me and my child in danger while being under the influence of drugs. 
She was driving while on something. I was with our 4 month old and was unaware at the time. She drove through a red light and almost drove into a concrete barrier. She does not remember any of it. 
She continues to buy pills regardless of our feelings. (Im sorry I do not know the names of the pills she takes. Some she buys and some she is prescribed and misuses). She can barely function and sends us hateful texts while on them. Later she has no memory of doing anything. 
We have threatened for her to no longer be able to visit our child in the past if she continued. She said it was black mail and tries to play victim. 
After this week of her drug escapade I'm done trying to keep the peace with her. I find myself hating her and I know she won't change. She causes fights between me and my husband. 

Now he is saying that he doesn't CARE that she does pills as long as it's not around our baby. I feel he is enabling her and I don't know what to do. He says he can't control what she does with her life. 

 She will probably visit again to see our daughter. I feel like my husband needs to grow a pair
 I know she helps us financially and she is the only one family or friend wise that can help us if something happens. But this is ridiculous.

He and his girlfriend moved from a small town so that he could pursue post secondary. At first his girlfriend was a bit standoffish, as she didn't have a lot in common with myself and her boyfriends friend group. 

Over the years I have noticed a lot of red flag behaviors from his girlfriend. Most notably, she will get angry with him and give him the silent treatment if he is home late from game nights. She has also made very little effort to get to know his friends, and doesn't really engage in conversation. 

Fast forward to this past year. They are both in a lot of debt, and she convinced him to get a brand new car. This is a car they both have to pay off, but only she can drive it as he doesn't have a license. She has refused to drive him places she doesn't want to go, even going so far as to tell him to drive himself. She actually encourages him to drive without a license! Not only that, she almost did not 'let' him go to a movie because she didn't want to see it herself. He wound up in a 20 minute argument while my friends waited to give him a lift to the film. 

Now, I absolutely understand if she is lonely, as I have been there. I remember being clingy at the beginning of my own relationship (Embarrassing, tbh). But this woman really rubs me the wrong way. Her behaviors are very controlling and selfish. Before you ask, I have defs tried to befriend her...but she doesn't really make it easy. Prickly is too gentle a word.

We started dating on September. Everything was fine by then, we spent a lot of time together on weekends (we live in two differents cities but is only a 35 min car drive). Everyone from our enviroment loves us as a couple, we have a lot of friends in common and we fit pretty well with the friends we didn't know before, everyone thinks we are so ""goals"", they love the way we treat each other and how we help the other one. We're deeply in love, she met my parents on December and I met his even earlier, in November.

Everything was so good, so easy, we were so happy. But we decided to start birth control. She became uninterested in sex, and was pretty unstable. She cried a lot and everything she told me was that it wasn't about my at all. We considered that birth control hormones were making her being so depressive, and she stoped taking it. After stoping, everything was good again. She become again the woman I was in love with.

But, a few weeks ago everything started being like that, but without a birth control hormones to blame. She's super unstable. She's always saying she loves me, and that I'm not the problem, but I'm starting to feel frustrated. I think she's having some mental health issue right know. I don't know what is it, but she's a person that get very stressed and she's working and studying at the moment, and in my opinion she can't take that much pressure on her and she should focus in his studies right know. She had mental health issues before and she even went to a psychologist, a I think she should go again to therapy. She has been in this ""unstable"" status 4 weeks, and she also became super uninterested in sex, like simply proposing having it or trying to (you know, doing a massage, cuddling...) kind of offended her.

Yesterday, I tried to be constructive and as supportive as I could. I told her than I'm worried. I tried to explain that when she started to be unstable again I tried not to tell anything to see if it was something that stands only for a week or two, but wasn't like that. I explained her that not having sex is affecting my self esteem, feeling that my gf is not interested at all in sex makes me think that she doesn't like me anymore.

His response was that she loved me a lot, and feels super bad for making me feel like that. She told me that I don't deserve that and that maybe I should dump her because I shouldn't stay with someone that is making me feel bad, but I'm not agree with that, I consider that it has a solution and isn't fully break. She told me that she wants some time to think about everything, and of course I respect her decision. But I'm pretty worried thinking about she's going to break with me or if did anything wrong. I do really think she needs to search from help from a therapist, but she doesn't seem that she consider that an option right know. Can I do anything to help her that I haven't considered? Or I should just wait to see what she ends up after giving her space and time to think? Any tip to deal with her and convincing her to search for help?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She said we should go our separate ways on Valentine’s Day we were not together very long but in that short space we did a lot together she met all my family and I tried to introduce her to my friends, she only introduced me to her parents once for dinner. A few days later she said it may be nothing and because I am down I missed my period I took a test and it was negative she was going to take another then following week and let me know.

I can guess that she is not pregnant but it's the fact that I walked around like a idiot for a month with addresses and numbers for clinics incase the worst came to the worst and this would be something she would not have to think about finding.

t2_3hz0abss,1553811299.0,b6p5e3,t3_b6p5e3,8," 

I'm a married man for 6 years with my wife (37F) and our young daughter. 6 very hard years with more downs than ups, last year being the hardest of them all. I still love my wife but due to the length of time that it hasn't been working out I felt I was on the brink of moving on. We had reached a point where even the fights had stopped cos we both had given up on finding common grounds. Out of loneliness I ended up talking about my situation with a female friend of mine. Let's call her M.

&amp;#x200B;

I've known this woman for a very long time and I've always felt some form of attraction to her but I've never acted on it. In the same way that I've never made an attempt to be too friendly with any other woman for as long as I've been with my wife.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't approach her with the intention to look for a new partner. It just happened that the conversation started and it kept going and going and I ended up spending a lot of time talking to her. She also opened up to me about how her marriage had recently gone through similarly very difficult times but they were now back on better terms and that she loved him once again after having spent a period of time hating him.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of our conversations I couldn't help but notice how her husband's weaknesses were my strengths and how my wife's weaknesses were her strengths, and the more time I spent with her I started seeing us as a perfect match.

At this point the cocktail of emotions that started building up inside me were something I've never experienced before. I was in love with 2 women at the same time. In my mind, my wife had the advantage of having a long history with me and also our daughter, but the disadvantage of all the baggage that our bumpy relationship brings with it. M, had the advantage of being ""new"" and exciting and that I felt we were more compatible, but the disadvantage that I knew deep inside it wasn't meant to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

She never led me on to think that there's a chance of something happening between us, she had a lot of time available to her simply due to having different working hours than her husband's, and I didn't feel I was able to control how I felt for her.

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime I've managed to convince my wife to seek professional help (thanks to M's advice) about her mental/hormonal health (I won't go into details). So at this point I'm seeing the possibility that my marriage can eventually (maybe/hopefully) get back on it's feet. This isn't something my wife will be able to do on her own though, she needs my full support which up till yesterday wasn't something I was able to provide, because emotionally I was split between 2 women.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand I felt like I was being a hypocrite with M for having these strong feelings for her while she's telling me about her marriage issues. I had a conflict of interest.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning my cocktail of emotions had reached the point where it was driving me crazy so I came to the conclusion that there's only 1 way out of this. I had to tell M the whole truth, knowing from beforehand that I was going to get rejected. I had to somehow find the inner strength to do this or else I was going to get stuck in a spiral. Sending a message is much easier than talking to a person face to face so I messaged her just to let her know there was something I haven't been telling her and that I need to tell her face to face. At this point there was no turning back. We met, and I told her.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; M, I'm in love with 2 women... and you are one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

There was an immediate feeling of guilt on her end and I reassured her that there was no need for that. I told her that I was doing this because I believe she had the right to know, and that it made me feel better now that I finally let it out. Even though there was no need of saying it she reiterated that she's in love with her husband and she couldn't reciprocate how I felt for her and she told me that I will need to learn to control this emotion.

&amp;#x200B;

Later on i picked my wife from work and gave her a big hug just to let her know that I'm there for her. I don't know if it will work out or not in the end, but I will try to keep this relationship from falling apart 1 more time.

&amp;#x200B;

I never would have thought that one day I was going tell another woman that I loved her to help my relationship with my wife.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is also my way of getting some closure.

t2_2qlovu6y,1553776226.0,b6i6ym,t3_b6i6ym,4,"I know this dude and his girlfriend for the same amout of time, little over one year to be precise, as they joined our now mutual friend circle through my best friend. The three of us went clubbing with our mutual friends on numerous occasions and the girl, lets call her Lisa, and I always got along very well.

At the beginning of our friendship I noticed that I seem to really fall in love with Lisa, but I tried to supress my feelings because I assumed she was happy in her relationship and was just interested in a friendship. I never even had her phone number as we only met randomly if she was with her boyfriend, and they decided to hang out with us, as we usually do.

But whenever we went clubbing it was like we only had eyes for eachother, like we spend most of the time dancing and partying together while her boyfriend was roaming around the place, talking to strangers or flirting with other girls.

This has been going on for about a year, until 1 Month ago, where I dunkenly told her that I really adore her. I told her that I really like her personality and that I was curious if she had a sister or a cousin that was similar to her ( I know, not the best approach^^). She told me that she has a cousin but she doesn't want me to meet her, so I just shrugged it off and tried to forget the conversation as I was really embarassed.

Now to the problem: last Saturday, at 3 am, she hit me up on snapchat, asking if I was still awake and if I wanted to hang out, because she didn't feel good and needed someone to talk. Being the dumbass that I am I said sure thing, so I grabbed a bottle of wine and met her. She didn't seem sad at all to be honest, and we just chilled the whole night, drinking wine and having a great, deep conversation. She was talking about how she really appreciates me as a person and that she has always enjoyed our nights out, and thanked me for caring for her when her boyfriend didn't. She also said that she ofthen thinks about the things I said to her.

As u can imagine, no good things happen after 2 am, and eventually we started holding hands, talking about our feelings for each other, and making out. Now imagine how I felt that night, holding hands with the girl I have adored for so long, when she suddenly tells me that she has wished for this to happen since we first met. She felt exactly like I did for a whole year, and we both supressed our feelings because we both thought we were only interested in a friendship.

​

We have been chatting for the last days , and we came to the conclusion that we both really want to commit to this, as we seem to be perfect for each other, but our situation is what is stopping us. If she broke up with her bf, we would have to hide the relationship for atleast half a year, or our friends will hate us and most likely cut contact. and her bf would still be part of our friend circle, which doesn't make it easy either. 

​

Please don't tell me that this is morally wrong, we both know and we won't go further before she is single, but I would appreciate advice on how to handle the situation in general. Or maybe I just wanted to get it off my chest, who knows.

I hope it is coherent, I'm not a native speaker :)

There is an important little twist to this: I am his dog's veterinarian. I do house calls. It's not like human medicine where you have HIPPA violations and doctor/client romantic relationships are forbidden. Just putting that out there. 

So I went to see his dog, and I end up sitting down and we're just chatting. He's asking me all sorts of personal questions about myself (like get to know you questions), and says at some point, ""Hey, I heard about X thing going on, I really want to go!"". I was really tired after a long day of appointments, so I didn't pick up on the hint (is this really a hint? My friends think so). But I did after a good night's sleep.

His response confused me, it was, ""yeah, um,  I really want to go. If I head down there I'll give you a call"". He seemed...hesitant? Maybe a little uncomfortable/awkward?  So I said, ""ok, let me know, I'd really love to go!"" and left it at that.  It was a little strange because up until then, all signs (not going to bore with a list) indicated really strong interest. He seemed to really enjoy talking to me. I'm really clueless when it comes to this sort of thing, but it seemed super obvious to me (and the friends that I asked) that he really seemed interested in me.

Since then, there was about a month break where I didn't really hear from him, and then he texted me about a question for his friend's dog (why not just give them my number?).  I've texted a few times, just random, non-pet related things, and he always responds, and fairly quickly at that.

Did I read him wrong? Was I not clear enough that I like him? Should I give up? Be more blunt? Ask him if he's seeing someone? Idk. I don't want to miss a 'thanks no thanks', or be stupid and just assume on his behalf either.

I’m currently in my senior year of high school and my traditional Asian parents want me to take a gap year before heading off to university so I can help out with their furniture store business. I thought this was a great idea since and it’s a win/win because I get to help them while still maturing to figure out which occupational pathway I would like to follow.

So a few months after this I thought it would be a good idea to build a PC with some of the money I’ve gathered from my part time job. This would make sense because my current computer is a piece of crap and it would be a fun thing to do and have before I head off to university.

My boyfriend Jason and I have been together for nearly 4 years. He’s not super close with his mom Anne, but she’s definitely a presence in our lives. They chat on the phone once a week and we see her on the major holidays.

She owns a bath product business and conducts the majority of her sales at trade shows each weekend around our area. Last year, she asked me if I had any friends who could help out over a weekend at a huge trade show. My friend Bianca offered. Anne agreed to pay cash and laid out the payment schedule to me to which Bianca agreed – I connected them and otherwise moved on with my life.

Cut to three months later, Bianca revealed to me that Anne had yet to pay her for her work (she was supposed to be paid at the end of each day). She told me she had followed up with Anne multiple times – she showed me screencaps of conversations where it was clear Anne was avoiding paying her, giving excuses about personal bills, etc. I was horrified. I told Jason, who called him mother immediately. Suddenly, Anne was on the phone with Bianca telling the money was definitely being transferred the next day. Of course, when the time came, she “forgot” how to e-transfer. Anne asked Jason to pay Bianca and she would pay us back. That was nearly a year ago and we haven’t seen that money since. I realize we bailed Anne out of that situation, but we could afford it at the time (it was $400 – not chump change but not life ending), and I just considered it a lesson learned to never help her out in that capacity again.  
 

Cut to this week. I’ve recently been laid off from a toxic job but offered a few months severance. Since I would be off for a few months, my boyfriend and I decided to get a puppy. I’ve spent the past month training my dog, taking a couple community college courses, and working on my resume. It’s been great. I just received a message from Anne: “Hi – Wondering if you are busy Friday and Sunday. I’m in a show and need help. I’ll pay you right there each day.” 

I don’t want to do this, for a few reasons. Friday truly is not realistic for me – I have an assignment due, a company has asked me to submit my resume for a position so I’d like take time to tailor it specifically, and of course, just watching our puppy. She didn’t inquire about Saturday because she thinks I’ll be helping her daughter move that day (I’ll actually be at home with the puppy).   
 If she had just said she needed help, I would be way more inclined – but by even making the promise of paying, my anger over the position she put me in with Bianca has re-emerged, and has reminded me we haven’t even been re-imbursed for that.   
 I’m looking on how to navigate this super uncomfortable situation. Jason is 100% on my side and knows that as nice as his mother is, she cannot run a business very well. He stepped in and handled the Bianca situation. He would with this as well, but she is going to continue to ask as long as I am off work, and I am not always going to have a legitimate reason. I’d love to figure out a respectful way to say that I can’t work for her, ever.

The scarring came from bad acne as a teenager and stress from relentless bullying. The broken nose was from a sports related accident. I had it fixed but it is still clearly not symmetrical.

I can look like an airbrushed version of my old self with makeup. My skin is smooth and my nose is straighter thanks to subtle contouring. My eyes look more alert via mascara, and my lips actually have some color with a natural lipstick. I’m far more attractive this way and people’s reactions to me are always so positive. It is like a shield for someone who deals with anxiety and was bullied previously. 

My relationship with my fiancé is amazing as far as emotional connection goes. We support each other like a team. There is a lot of affection and cooking or cleaning for one another just to create more happiness. He tells me Im the love of his life and always wants me with him. I’ve never had anyone care for me this much and I’ve never put so much effort in to someone else. But I’m very well aware of the fact that his previous girlfriends were gorgeous (even if one left him out of the blue and the other was a cheater). When we first met he said something along the lines of “you are so pretty / I wouldn’t date an ugly girl”.

I suppose I let this go on as long as I have because he has hid a few things from me and slowly revealed the truth over months of dating. One is to do with his appearance and he paid a bundle for a cosmetic fix for it. Unfortunately my issues aren’t as easy to get rid of.

I’m not really sure what to do anymore. It has been a wonderful three years and I finally got to see what life is like when someone loves you. But I think some of that love is conditional and that is why I’ve hidden myself for so long. I cannot keep living up to the stress of being beautiful. Every day has to be planned so carefully and I’ve been unable to pursue treatments for my scars as this will make me look worse for some time thanks to swelling, redness, peeling, etc.

It is a ridiculous situation and I already blame myself for every day.

I got some help but also received numerous advice from here and other places. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I wasn't specifically diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, I was told I have inattention towards things that are not related to me or aren't a direct benefit to me, due to a lack of empathy that actually developed later in my life after I became a Engineering major started to see everything in logical steps and solutions. I stopped thinking about how other people felt and instead focused on the logical progression of events and how they were arranged in my internal queue.  I didn't always have this issue, and my therapist helped me realize I had more empathy in middle/high school when I read more books, communicated more often with a variety of people, and did a lot of writing when trying to understand texts and pieces or literature and art. As a result, I'm trying to read more books, find a deeper and abstract meaning in pieces of literature and art, and just talk to more people besides my girlfriend and close friends. I also tend to go off on tangents when I don't know the answer, instead of saying ""I don't know"". However, it wasn't specifically for every person; I most often go off on tangents when answering a question my girlfriend asks me because for some reason, I shy away from appearing as if I don't know something. It was suggested to me that I might be afraid to show a lack of knowledge of anything to my girlfriend, which I don't specifically understand why because I don't think I feel that way, but it might be something underlying that I need to dig deeper in to. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I've received solutions, and have been implementing them, which is good, because stepping out of that comfort zone has been helpful to expanding, or rather, expending my mind and my understanding of things, I'm not sure exactly how to apologize to my girlfriend. I have definitely gone through the process with my therapist, so I know how to apologize, but the thing is that I've made the mistake so many times, I know that apologies become less useful. I have a better understanding of how she feels as well, so I don't want to apologize and just have it seem meaningless, repetitive, or disrespectful. We are on somewhat speaking terms, but I can tell she's upset at me. I think the most important thing to show her is results, but those need to come in time and over a long period of time. Right now I need to apologize and make it up to her, but I'm not sure how to do that.

We've went to different colleges in different states but still stayed very close. Recently I feel that she's hit her post-grad crisis. I hit mine after I graduated and now that I am working FT and doing what I like I feel able to help her miss the speedbumps that really messed me up. 



During my crisis, she was still at university or study abroad and I do not hold it against her that she wasn't available because when she was, she was very supportive. Also, I wasn't a great communicator so I now know that's on me. 



Anyways, Rina is clearly in a rut and unmotivated and I am getting worried for her. She's very picky about her job prospects but hates writing cover letters or reworking her resume. I have sat down with her, made goals, send her links to jobs, but she will maybe do a job application every two or three weeks. On top of that, she hates going out. I figured trying to get her to do things would help but she's refused hiking or concerts, and cites being broke preventing her from doing much except stay home and play video games. Her parent's house is only a 30 minute drive away from the city I live in, so it's not like she's stuck either.



I've been independent since I was 17, due to home issues, so it's reaching a point where I'm worried and frustrated on how to proceed. Even at my lowest points, I knew no one would help me get out of my hole except myself. Rina gets offended when I bring up therapy or pissy if I bring up her lack of motivation. Sometimes I feel like this isn't the Rina I remember. There are tons of opportunities in my city, but I don't know how to help her get back out the door. 



It's starting to affect my own schedule and outings. She gets snippy even when I mention ""tgif"" in our group chat let alone complain about work on hard days or if I talk about events and hobbies I am doing. When she does drive to visit me  all she wants to do is stay in my living room and watch youtube videos on her laptop or nap on my couch. What should I do?

My girlfriend and I are going through a bit of a rough patch, there’s a lot of issues we have but I think 2/3 are solvable although I’m not sure how to go about this one. 

My girlfriends Mother is a dick. I don’t know how else to say it. There was one incident where I was balancing scrabble tokens, she said I shouldn’t as they’ll fall and I replied saying they wouldn’t, she smacked them out of my hand and then said “Told you. Pick them up”. Additionally she is quite controlling and manipulative, a couple months ago my girlfriend was meant to come round one night as we only really get one night a week alone due to work and other stuff but her Mother pulled a literal ‘:(‘ and then went on to say how “She’ll be alone all night but it’s fine you go have fun”. This exact line has been used around 8 times now and we see each other outside of school about once a fortnight. The issue now is that my girlfriend says family is important to her and that I get along with them, which IMO is fair enough. I get along excellently with her Dad and Sister + Sisters Boyfriend but just not her Mum. 

I offered to let everything go and try to get along with her more but she then replied that she wants it to be natural. I don’t know how to overcome this, her Mother is a controlling child who pisses me off and I’m seemingly the only one to not take it. My girlfriend has even admitted she annoys her, but “that’s how she is”. I feel as if I even do start to try and get along with her that my girlfriend will not see it as fake and ‘not natural’. 

Thanks for reading &lt;3

TL;DR - girlfriends mother is a dick and has been on multiple occasions. I get along with the rest of her family. I’m the only one that doesn’t stand for it even though my girlfriend has admitted she finds her annoying sometimes too. She thinks I should be natural with her family and even if I do get along with her now I’m scared it’ll come across as ‘not natural’.

Last week is when the issues appeared, she seemed distant and rather strange. She also just got off birth control as she was having problem with her old one about a month ago. I asked her a few times what was bothering her and she pushed it off and said she was fine and that she didn't think she was acting strange. Somehow her ex came in up in the conversation and I asked her if she thought she moved on too fast from him, and should told me she didn't want to talk about it as it was giving her anxiety. She had a 4 year relationship and we started talking after 3 months after their break up (so now it's been almost 6 months since their break up). She also hates her ex and has blocked him on everything as he was very mentally abusive to her so I don't think her cheating on me is even a scenario. Last night I finally said it and told her that she was pushing me away, for example every time I said ""I love you"" she would defer to something else and wouldn't say it back which was strange. So last night she finally admitted that she feels empty on the inside and has no feelings, but says it's not depression. After talking and not getting anywhere for a few hours, I finally just asked her if she wants time and space to find herself, and she said that's the part that scares her the most since I'm the best thing that's ever happened to her. She started having more anxiety so we dropped the conversation there. I really don't want to lose her so I'm not really sure on what to do.

I originally came on this subreddit asking for advice (I changed our ages because I was afraid he’d find the post) and have since spoken with a lot of my other friends about it. They’ve all expressed concerns that, despite my friend’s claims otherwise, he is not trying to get over me and is treating our friendship like a game he can win. I’ve also learned from them that he doesn’t actually talk to or about anyone but me, and he’s been actively ignoring the other members of our friend group when I’m not around. 

I reached out to him to have a discussion, and we’re meeting at a coffee shop tomorrow night so I can confront him about this. He’s never done anything violent or spiteful that I’ve seen, but despite this I’m really scared. I’ve been in a similar position before with other guys but they’ve always been more stalker-ish and not my friends. Others have advised me to be very safe and have offered to be present during the talk, and it’s giving me the vibe like they’re afraid he’ll react violently towards me. We’re carpooling to the coffee place, which is close enough I feel comfortable calling a car home, but suddenly the idea of letting him drive me there makes me nervous?

I intend to tell him that his actions are making me uncomfortable and that we need to take a break at the very least. I’m prepared to cut him out of my life if necessary. I’m really anxious about this conversation and I want to go in with a level head, because every time we’ve had these talks in the past he’s started crying and it’s up to me to calm him down if I want the conversation to continue. Whether he’s doing it on purpose or not, I don’t want him to manipulate me into doubting my perceptions. Any advice?

TL;DR I’m finally going to confront my friend about his obsession with me, and I’m scared as hell. What can I do to stand firm and not be manipulated?

t2_3hxi0eum,1553794428.0,b6lqtf,t3_b6lqtf,7," Hello all,

I'm a 22 year old male, and 3 days ago I broke up with my girlfriend for the second time. To fully understand the situation I will take you back to when we first started dating.

&amp;#x200B;

I was out with a bunch of friend, and met her in a club. This is an ex colleague I used to work with in a restaurant. We made out, even though she had a boyfriend. I texted her the next morning saying sorry for my behaviour. She texted back that she really enjoyed the night before and we stayed in contact. A few weeks later I fell in love, even though she was still in a relationship. Despite the fact that she was in a relationship, the love was concensual. She would keep telling me that she would break up with her boyfriend, but never actually did. Half a year passes and I decided to end contact. Lo and behold, she breaks up with her current boyfriend and we can actually start dating seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

We quickly become boyfriend and girlfriend. Though, it sometimes feel like I have to put in the effort and she isn't taking it too seriously. In hindsight it was probably because of her recent breakup, and I was too in love to care about it too much. In addition, she had a condition with which she couldn't have sex. Throughout or relationship I never had trouble with this, and repeatedly told her so.

&amp;#x200B;

However, things changed. For some reason, after a few months, she starts becoming really jealous to me. Whenever I mention a girl, work with a girl, or look at something without a penis she gets pissed off. This would go on for a few months until I had enough of it. She explained to me that she became this jealous because of her ""problem"". I tried to reassure her so many times that it didn't matter to me, and I still loved her unconditionally.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time I also found out alot of things about myself, for example that I have ADHD. Not only is this an attention disorder, it can also affect a lot of other parts in your life, for example relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

Our relationship was great, we did a lot of fun stuff, I trusted her with everything. She was everything I ever wished for and wish it didn't end up the way it did. Though, the jealousy kept going on. Then comes an evening of going out with friends, and I cheat on her. I still regret this to this day. The next morning I felt so much guilt that I break up with her. I didn't want to hurt her feelings and decided to never tell her. I'm a coward, I know.

&amp;#x200B;

She doesn't accept the breakup, she keeps texting me, calling me, and in the end looks for me when I'm out with my friends. Being drunk, I made out with her and she sleeps at my place. Within a few days we are back together again. We decided it would be best to stay together and work on ourselves. She would try to be less jealous, and I would work on my ADHD problems. For the first few weeks after that, the relationship is fantastic again. We do fun things, and she is not as jealous it seems. Though, in the next few months she starts becoming jealous at everything again, and we fall back into the same thing we had before. I know she loves me very very very much (maybe too much), and I love her too. She never really had anything going on for herself, I was her everything besides school and work.

&amp;#x200B;

For a few weeks I had the thought of breaking up with her. I was sick of lying about super simple stuff. I would lie about who I worked with (I would say I worked with a male coworker, even though the coworker was female), I would lie about what I was doing and why I couldn't respond to a call. I visited my parents house and told them how my relationship was, and explained to them how jealous she became. They told me to move out of the relationship, and that it was certainly unhealthy.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did. I was supposed to pick her up to stay the night at my place, but instead I told her I wanted to break up. Just like last time, it was no fun. She wanted to follow me outside but her mom stopped her, it was really really bad. I drove home that night crying all the way. 3 Days later, I'm still really sad about the whole situation. I decided to have a few beers this evening and am typing this now. I know she loves me unconditionally, and I love her too, but I can't take it anymore. It all became too much for me, I felt guilty over such stupid shit. In the end of our relationship I couldn't really tell what was actually bad, and what was just bad in her eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

On paper, our relationship was perfect, in reality, it often made me feel really shitty. I miss her though.. Damn I miss her so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this post doesn't make sense, English is not my first language and I've had a few beers. Cheers all.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I don't know if I made the right decision after breaking up with my girlfriend. My parents kind of talked me into it, but still I had it in my mind for a few weeks. My girlfriend was really jealous and had a condition that didn't allow her to have sex. I feel sad and lonely now, so I made this post to get things straight in my head. Even if one person reads this it's good. ",relationships,I(22m) broke up with my girlfriend(21f) of 2 years

We basically spend everyday together; either going back home together from school or going on dates during the weekend or on breaks between trimesters. I know she loves me a lot and cares for me very much and I equal feel the same way about her. She’s also had a really rough past with her ex, few years back, who cheated on her so she knows what it feels like to be in the receiving end. 

But for some fucking reason I have this paranoia of her either cheating on me or breaking up with me. I basically only think about it when I’m not with her and especially when I find time to contemplate (e.g. in the shower) on days when I don’t see her at all. 

It could be that I just spend time with her too much or I think this relationship is too good that I start creating problems for myself. 

If it is, that I spend too much time with her the best solution may be to spend less time with each other but I really, really dislike that idea. It seems as if we’re putting a wall between us and it feels like what a dying relationship would do.

The paranoia is starting get worse and worse and I need help. Why do I keep getting paranoid and what should I do to stop it. 

tl;dr: very healthy relationship but I’m getting paranoid that my gf is cheating on me or going to break up with me. Need help! 

Edit: writing this made me realize some important points I should add. This my first real relationship I’ve ever had.

I realized that there are a few minor problems:
• my gf did dump me once around two years ago but that was because she just broke up with her ex and she wasn’t really ready for a relationship again.
• my gf has mentioned before that “I am just right” in terms of looks; meaning not too ugly nor not too good looking which has definitely hurt my self confidence to an extent 
• although I have warned her and she already stopped, she had been a little too physical with other guys: sitting on another guys lap, putting head on another guy’s shoulder, and kissing another guy’s cheek or kissing the lips of another girl (she is straight tho)

I have an older IKEA table (not a desk), which has screw on legs at each corner of the table. The screw on legs are screwed into what I would call a ""rail"" or ""bar""; this rail/bar is about 1"" in height, and leaves  about 1/2"" - 1"" of trim (I will take a picture at home, but can't find anything on google atm to show this; essentially there is smaller frame on the underside of the table). 

The problem is the clamp needs about 3"" of depth at the edge of the table, and I only have about 1/2"" - 1"" due to the rail/bar. I was going to do an exact measurement of the height of the bar (~1""), cut out a shim to fill that gap, and then clamp the mount to the shim, bar and tabletop. But part of me thinks this might not be the best idea, or it's not a very solid construction. I'm sure this is a somewhat common issue, but I had trouble finding an answer/solution on Google. (The obvious solution is buy a mount which already fits your desk, but I was not going to buy a free standing mount as it seemed to the defeat my purposes of ""saving space"".)

I am not going to drill into this table, as it's a table and only a ""temporary"" desk -- when I buy a new desk I intend to make sure it won't have a ""lip"" like this table does. But until then, I'm trying to find a temporary solution!

I hope I am using the terminology and the follow the subreddit rules right, and please feel free to correct me! Thanks!

EDIT: I'm starting to think that, instead of cutting one block to fill the gap (both depth and height) and clamping onto both that block AND the frame/bar/rail, it might be better to construct a piece which would go over each side of the rail, and create one flat surface for me to clamp onto (i.e., it would be shaped like a U and just go over the frame completely).

We recently had a new shower installed and after a few weeks the shower head holder clamp(?) started to become wobbly. I didn't want to seek professional help for something that seemed trivial but I now regret that.

I noticed a screw so assumed it would be as easy as tightening it a bit, I opted to remove the screw completely to check it before I would tighten it up again.

I am unable to put the screw back in place, there is spring, a plastic ring (presumably for decoration), the shower head holder and a screw. I am putting them on in the correct order, I was careful to note how it came apart.

Here is an album of each part and my current progress:

I tried unscrewing the plastic nuts underneath with no success, using a wrench and a deep seat socket wrench. I think the only way I’m going to have any success is by getting the darn caps off.

Just a quick question, I ordered this doorframe earlier and had it delivered and upon unwrapping it found it to look like the picture linked.

[My door frame.](https://imgur.com/kIObThd)

Am I wrong in thinking that this is faulty or that something is missing?

For instance, the black stuff up the left-hand side of the frame is the weather stripping, the plastic bar across the bottom has the ""mushy"" weather sealing side facing the same way, so it's obviously intended to act as a seal also, the only problem is it's about an inch away from the rest of the sealing material and the stops and unless I rabbet the bottom of the door, this thing is just going to cause the door to sit about an inch away from the frame when it shuts which isn't how I think it's intended to be.

This frame comes with the cil preinstalled, it's just that plastic bit that seems funky...

I'm working on building a loft in my garage, and wanted a sanity check / advice on my current design. My garage has about 22' ceilings - it would be a shame to waste all that vertical space. Here are some of the details:

&amp;#x200B;

\* 2 16"" x 1.75"" doubled up LVL Ledger Boards connected to existing studs on opposite walls using FastenMaster Timberlok screws (directly above concrete foundation)

\* 16"" x 2.5"" Engineered Lumber I-Joists, 16"" OC, connected to ledger boards using face mount joist hangers

\* OSB subfloor acting as lateral bracing

\* The clearspan is about 22' across the garage, depth of the loft is about 12'

&amp;#x200B;

I've added links to a couple screenshots of my current design. Are there any issues with the current design, specifically related to the ledger boards - is ledger to ledger joist hanging acceptable? Thank you so much in advance for any advice!

I have having some serious issues on a couple of fronts that are really beginning to frustrate me and I’m hoping for some advice from any cutting board experts out there. 

My biggest problem is the pieces of my patterns not lining up perfectly, this is usually caused by 2 things.

1. Shifting during glue up.
2. Slight variations in thickness of the stock, or non square cuts.

Problem 1 I understand, in my last project, an 18x26 2 inch thick board I was absolutely meticulous in my glue up, only glued 2 rows at a time to limit the number of joints that could cause issues, and yet somehow, despite clamping from every direction, using hardwood runner boards to keep everything in line, I still had tiny little shifts during glue up that then make the pattern look off, ruining the board.

Does anyone who is used to gluing up hundreds of pieces in a pattern have any tips to help with shifting? 

Problem 2: This one really kills me, I spent 3 hours milling the stock for my last piece, milling 5, 48 inch 2 x 2 maple boards and 2, 48 inch 1x2 walnut boards. I worked in batches so all the maple was done together, jointed, then planed, I checked for square with my carpenter square every pass on every board (on the end), I was meticulous because I’ve had this issue with my mini version I made first as a trial. Somehow, despite all that, I ended up with variations in thickness, pieces that did not appear to be square once cut, which ruin the pattern. 

Under normal circumstances tiny variations are fine but in my case where I’m lining up 30 pieces of walnut end to end, the slightest variation in thickness makes my line no longer appear straight/continuous  and it ruins the pattern. 

I don’t know where these variations are coming from, I have a dewalt DW735x planer and a cheap little porter cable jointer (needs to be replaced with a big boy jointer one of these days). I’m pretty confident the jointer is the cause of my slight variations, but I have spent HOURS making sure the fence and tables are square and true. I’ll glue the pieces up and everything looks good, then I start planing down the final board and discover a spot where now the walnut appears to be jutting out into the pattern like it wasn’t square all the way through. Hard to explain I guess, hopefully you know what I mean.

So 2nd bit of advice I’m hoping for, does anyone have a tip or process that you use to address / eliminate small variations, or make sure that you can get square stock, that doesn’t involve me having to buy a professional jointer. As much as I would love to do that I think my wife would end me, and I really don’t have the room. 

I’ve contemplated just having the lumber supplier mill everything for me, but I feel like I should be able to do this, I don’t know why I’m having such a hard time. 

Sorry for the length, I’m including my failure pictures so you can see the screw ups in the small sample board and then again in the large board (Which were supposed to be avoided by doing the trial board 🤬) maybe it will make more sense or someone can tell me the way I should be gluing this up / laying this out so I can stop messing it up repeatedly.

We laughed, had fun, talked about things we enjoy (movies, music, etc). We also were supportive of each other. We felt comfortable talking about things that bothered us. We had a really good thing.

Over the last year, there's been less and less of the good. Every conversation we have is her feeling down or being frustrated or upset or worried. Thing is, being there and helping the people I care about is what really makes me feel like my life has meaning. So I'm happy to have her back and be her sounding board. But it's just so taxing. It never lets up. When I was doing my psychiatry rotation for medical school (a month ago), I felt like I was working every minute of every day even after I came home.

I realize it's weird to say, but I feel like my relationship with her is becoming parental. I feel like I'm a caretaker. Moreover, I feel like I can't come to her about the things in my life that aren't good because I feel like I have to be this pillar of strength for her. On top of it, she does this thing where if I ever even hint that I'm not all smiles and sunshine, she talks down about herself saying ""I'm stupid. You've been through so much more than me and your problems are so much worse than mine"" (she's obsessed with the fact that my mother died when I was a teenager and it left me with some mental health problems that I've mostly gotten past at this point in my life) and then she won't tell me anything for a week.

I love her so very much. I just don't know how to tell her what I'm feeling. I want to be her boyfriend (hell, wouldn't mind being her husband) and tackle life together, not be her hero that she only turns to when she needs metaphorical saving.

He doesn't want to stay where he lives now as it's a bit of a dump and his roommates and him don't get along very well.

About two weeks ago, she brings back this 6'9 guy that looks like she came straight out of the show Vikings. I.E my dream guy. 

They had very loud sex which I couldn't help but get off to. And yes I feel a little weird about that. Anyway she wakes me at like 6am to tell me she needs to rush to work. She asks me to just make this guy a coffee when he wakes up then send him on his way. 

Well he finally crawls out of bed around 9am and I make us both a drink. We got to chatting and one thing led to another and we started making out and I gave him a handjob. He had a shower before taking my number and leaving. 

At first I was concerned he just used both of us. But we have been on one date together and text all the time. We have both agreed we really like each other. He told me he wished we met in a better situation but hopes having sex with my sister won't be an issue. it's not for me atleast. 

We haven't had sex yet (apart from the handjob) as we haven't been able to be alone. Im starting to really want him sexually. He lives on a Barack's with his dad so I can't just waltz in. 

Which leaves my place. Now the issue is how to I explain to my sister that the guy she had a one night stand with is now the guy I'm seeing. I'm worried she will have questions about when it started as its the only possible way we could of met and she might potentially feel betrayed. 

She doesn't have feelings for him and has been with guys since however she has talked about him not responding to texts (which I new) and occasionally tells me she wants to fuck him again which annoys me a little. I'm just worried it's going to be awkward as hell.

Suffice it to say, our situation is unusual and unique, and from the start I knew that my girlfriend had zero sex drive. But we still had sex on a regular basis, which I felt was a great gift from her, something she was doing for my sake because she loved me.

A half a year ago, that all stopped. And while that was frustrating, I might have been able to deal with that if that's all it was. But my girlfriend has completely shut off sexually. Any sort of sexual contact between the two of us is pretty much gone now. I know that none of this is anything that she cares about, but it matters a great deal to me, and it feels like she just stopped caring about my wants and needs.

I pled with her to try to work with me on this, to try to find some sort of compromise that we could both be okay with, that while I would be disappointed with the loss of sex, I wanted to at least have some semblance of that connection to her. She said she didn't feel that she should do anything she doesn't want to - no sacrifices or concessions, no compromises, nothing. I tried to explain that I felt that people who cared about each other tried to work with each other to try to find ways to make each other happy, but she wasn't having any of it.

I'm not demanding sex. I'm not demanding that we do everything I want. I'm not saying that only the things that I want matter. But it seems that my girlfriend has suddenly flicked a switch in her head and decided that *nothing* I want matters, if it's not something that matters to her too.

I've tried asking her to go to couples counseling, but she has no interest in going. And it's starting to feel increasingly like talking to a brick wall, someone who refuses to give an inch on *anything*, who doesn't care about my feelings on things, and doesn't even want to try to work through this.

We've been together for two years, and I feel like a half a year ago she suddenly decided to stop loving me. Not when she stopped having sex with me, but when she stopped trying to work with me on our relationship, and decided to make unilateral decisions for the both of us.

We never shared the same interests, but it was always alright, got over toxic friendships with other people twice. It just worked out.
Recently though, she's become worse. She was always psychologically weak, introverted and easily hurt. But i don't know how to deal anymore. 

If she makes sarcastic jokes, and uses offensive language, it's always ok because it was a joke. If i say one thing, she blows up, and ignores me and one other friend (18F) for a while after an argument. 
At Christmas she got really angry at me because i met my long distance boyfriend the whole time, and i forgot to hang out with her, which is understandable. I told her we'd hang out. But i had to apologize over and over again and she never really accepted it.

Now, months later, she tells me sorry, she forgot the date of a concert we wanted to go to since last year, got the tickets and all... She bought BTS tickets for that day, payed the flight and everything. I said i wasn't angry. Because honestly, I don't know anymore.

Talking about BTS, she's become a manic k-pop fan. Goes to concerts all the time, talks about nothing else. Posts on her WhatsApp, on her twitter, all about them. She asked me who i shipped her with the least, i circled one of the idols and wrote 'he kinda ugly' 

You won't believe how crazy she went.
She quoted a song with something along those lines of 'look in the mirror'. So she got at me basically with 'no you.' then told me how insulting and horrible i was for insulting this 'poor Teddy' and how he got hate so much and stuff. I don't know one thing about the band so, nice try. 
Then she called me stupid. Now she's ignoring me and the other friend since 2 days almost. 

She often plays the victim role, is allowed to do everything but i someone acts a way she dislikes, she explodes.

There also was a big fight because i was talking about what i achieved until now (I've had a hard time) and she took it as an insult because she felt she didn't have all that and didn't have any friends (one of my points on the list, amazing friends at school). 
But somehow now she's always going out to drink with her school friends? Just about 1 month later? She also didn't drink before.

I can't really remember how it happened, but my coworker started saying to me that he thought I was really beautiful, intelligent and funny and that we have a connection, he proceeded to start holding my hand. I told him it's not okay, and to think about his wife (who I know). He hugged me, saying he wanted to make sure I was okay, but i didn't feel comfortable with it as it was a bit too long and felt like he was trying to make a move. Anyway he continued to speak about how he has feelings for me etc, getting a little too close for comfort. In hindsight I should have just told him to leave but I had had a few too many drinks.

I’m 23 f, my bf is 21 m. During this relationship I tend to hold onto past mistakes. 
So on New Year’s Eve, my bf, his brother and I tried to go to a pub (I was 9 month pregnant I just wanted to go out but not drink fyi) but none were open except clubs. I didn’t want to go in the club being pregnant and not dressy. In the end, we decided to go back home. I told them I would bust out the non alc rosé and make a cheese board. His brother is upset. My bf convinces his bro to come to the table and watch the NYC New Years live. 5 mins before midnight, we’re snacking and his brother asked us if we’re going to kiss and my bf got the impression his brother was uncomfortable. I didn’t really clue in and thought we were going to kiss. (Background: his bro is lonely and wants a gf plus we moved to a different city so we didn’t make friends yet) So, it’s midnight and we cheered our cups. For a split second I waited for my bf to kiss me and saw he didn’t even flinch to. 
I played it off and moved on for the sake of it. I did enjoy my night though. 
Later on as we were heading to bed, I asked why he didn’t kiss me at midnight and told me he didn’t want to make his brother uncomfortable and upset.
This is our second New Years and we didn’t kiss yet on New Years. The first one I visited family and we were a days travel apart. This year he wanted to protect his brother’s feelings and wait to kiss until I mentioned it. 

This is also my first real relationship. My first one I was 13 and that doesn’t count. I was always scared to date and worked up the courage to say yes to him.

t2_1e2zzofu,1553790294.0,b6kvrv,t3_b6kvrv,4,"So I’ve been dating her for a year now and I started dating her when I had major sleep issues so I kinda took the first girl that had interest in me because okay cool whatever. We met on a dating app and it’s always been long distance (45 minutes usually) and for the first few months it was awesome!

But as I’ve caught up on sleep I realize that she’s a very obnoxious and dramatic person. She’s a great girlfriend and means well with core values but we have different life plans ahead of us.

She wants to move to DC (USA) and work as a director somewhere while I want to remain close to home by my family in the northeast. I am highly functioning autistic so I need to further my seasonal special interests otherwise I go crazy.

She wasn’t like that to start and away from each other we seem fine but once I go to her house (which is every weekend) I feel like we always get into it. She’s a very stubborn person who comes off harshly and I’m laid back and just do my thing so when I’m around her I escalate into her and we get into it. I don’t feel like myself around her and feel very guarded because of her strong personality. She’s loud and dramatic and all that.

It’s an every weekend thing too. We never did this before and I’m wondering if it’s because she’s more comfortable around me or whatever it is.

But she’s the type of person that is so career and life oriented that you can’t even help her with anything because she has it “figured out.” Meanwhile she’s always on my case about what I do and it comes off as more of a mother thing than a girlfriend. We are supposed to co-exist and it doesn’t feel like we are compatible in the slightest anymore.

Is this all in my head? Maybe we just are a little too opposite for one another? Because nobody else says what she says I do (about being difficult or high maintenance) so I’m thinking it’s not me and it’s her.

I just need help explaining. Sorry if I left out details that’s really the gist of it. I feel this wall between us when I’m with her and while we’ve had some good moments I just don’t think we click. And I date for the long run so if she wants me to move with her or do this and that then I don’t know. I like being close to family and I just feel like I’m wasting my time.

And I’ve read articles affirming my incompatibility theory which probably doesn’t help but still. 

She’s a very dominant person and (this is gonna sound stupid but I’ll say it anyways) I feel a little powerless not being the primary support system. I as a guy feel like my girlfriend should always be able to come to me for help and she NEVER does that. She’s so independent and driven that she can do no wrong and it’s always me who needs improving. 

I grew up in a family where that was the case with men so excuse my traditional way of thinking but I truly enjoy being a means of support. And it goes both ways. 

Be honest with me please, am I being ridiculous or are we too different from each other?

Now I'm in college but one 2.5 hours from his. For a year it was good. After that, it's like we've been fighting even more and more. Our conversations are through messaging through out the day and rarely videochat. My roommate says our arguments are about the weirdest things. (For example, he doesn't like when I correct his grammar, but he knows I can't help it because I'm K-6 major. I want him to do better and not have him be embarrassed for simple mistakes in his career.) These fights we have are long drawn out. We will argue, stop talking, keep being mad for a day, solve/not solve, we will be okay for a few days, and repeat. Anyways, I've always thought we've been good together when we are actually with each other in person. We see each other for a few days about every two months. Though these fights really get to me sometimes. It causes a lot more conflict when we should both be trying to finish bachelor's. There's so much stress.

Edit: The grammar correcting is not a day lasting argument. When it rarely has happened, it has been fairly short arguments. I did not want to bring up any other examples.

t2_2blm1m4z,1553789985.0,b6ktjc,t3_b6ktjc,6,"Okay, so harsh title aside, I love my gf and plan to marry her. I worded it harshly to catch some attention. Now that you’re here, let me describe the problem somewhat vaguely to avoid identification.

We have a great relationship of 3.5 years. It was rocky at the start, but I’m proud and happy with where we are except this one issue that I don’t know how to address that’s becoming a bigger and bigger issue for me.

The issue is that even when we’re doing great, she seems to need come up with some kind of issue to come after me about. It’s like she has to have something to complain about every so often or that I’m always doing something that is “obviously” some kind of slight towards her. 

I’m getting exhausted with this mentality that I’m always doing her wrong in some way. I won’t say that all of her concerns are completely fabricated to make trouble. She has brought up relevant issues and I will address them. But the vast majority just feels like she just wants something that needs fixing or needs something to be wrong in the relationship. I’ll try to discuss them still but if I disagree in anyway, she just shuts down and accuses me of not listening and cuts the conversation off since im apparently going to ignore her wants and needs.

The most recent example of this behavior:

- Says that I prioritize my friend over her. I hangout with my buddy once every one or two weeks. We get together after work and play some games all night, then I dip out late at night. Typically on a weekday. Total time actually hanging out is maybe five hours. I don’t feel like this is an unreasonable amount of time to spend with my friends. Her and I usually have all or most of the weekend due to conflicting work schedules during the week so I’m definitely spending more time with her and as much time with her as We can but also, she spends far more time with her friends so It feels like she’s making this into an issue just to have something wrong with the relationship. It feels like she just doesn’t want me to hangout with him at all sometimes which I don’t get.

This isn’t the only example of she’s doing that makes me feel like she just needs to have some kind of issue with me but just the most recent. But I don’t want an even longer essay of a post either. I know her feelings are valid and I always try to treat them as such, but I do try and be honest with her if I disagree or just don’t see where she’s coming from and need explaining but all of these are met with her shutting down the conversation and my wanting to talk about it if I do anything other than just agree that it’s an issue and promise to address it. But even doing that just means that there will be something else for her to be unhappy with later. I address one issue and a new one pops up a few weeks or a month later that has been supposedly boiling for some time. **Half the time she even says that she overreacted and that it isn’t an issue but In a few weeks or months it comes back up.**

I’m exhausted. I don’t want to tell her to just straight up stop nagging me over these petty things because it’s invalidating. But I’m walking on eggshells always worried that shes going to use something to bring up some type of underlying issue that she’s supposedly kept quiet about forever until just now. But if we have a “huge” issue that needs addressing every couple weeks then none of them seem very huge anymore and it’s hard not to go to a “oh here we go again” mentality. I’m at the point where I’m wondering if she even likes me because of how many of these issues come up. It’s always something every few weeks and some of them are even things that she’s actually doing.

What I’m asking here Reddit, is what do I do? How do I tell her that it feels like she just wants something to be unhappy about? And how do we fix this issue? Am I just being a dick? I know I come off as dismissive and probably as a shitty boyfriend. But I’m so tired of there always being some issue every few weeks. The time in between is awesome and fun and we have a blast together. But every few weeks I lose a day to some new issue or some issue that she swore wasn’t really an issue a few weeks ago.

TLDR: Gf always has something I’m doing wrong. I’m exhausted and need advice on how to stop it.

t2_1bw8gbcw,1553789272.0,b6ko4c,t3_b6ko4c,4,"TLDR : CAUGHT MY BF DOING C0KE BEFORE WORK, MADE HIM TAKE A TEST AND SHOWED POSITIVE... SAYS HE WANTS TO STOP AND HE HAS BEEN LYING, please read on - thank you readers! :)

When I first met my boyfriend he used to go out lots, he had been single for about 6 years on and off seeing people. He is now 30 and we have been together 6 months. I knew he drunk a lot and done drugs (c0ke) a lot, but he agreed he doesn’t want “that life” anymore and wants to “change”.

His social circle do drugs regularly, twice a week. BF has cut down from going out twice a week to once a fortnight with me. But he has football training on a Wednesday night, and if I go out after work on a Friday he will head down to the pub for a “couple”. BF swore that on these occasions he didn’t take drugs, but I was always hesitant to believe him as his best friend carrys it around like it is pepsi max. He wants my BF to do it so continually offers it to him and my bf told me that he would say NO. I caught him out a week ago because his friend called him up drunk and my bf said you want to lay off the drugs! To him on the phone, then the friend said to my bf on the phone (he couldn’t tell I could hear him) YOU CAN TALK YOU DONE IS BEFORE WORK THE OTHER NIGHT !!!! my bf has been working nights, and after he got off the phone he admitted he had done it after football training and before he left for work last Wednesday, I am disgusted. He has to drive to work, he could lose everything, his job ec.

BF has made a lot of effort to half change his life around, he has taken up the gym, swimming, thanked me for making him like his old self again. He really gets excited about the future and wants to live together, talks about kids, getting dogs, my opinion is that he really is excited about settling down with me. anyway, me being me (and after I noticed every week he would have a blocked nose, when I asked him about it he said his nose was messed up from years of doing it, or hayfever) ordered a drugs test online and what do you know, he agreed to take it – test come back positive. He can’t pinpoint the last time he done it, he said it was on the 15th March but he was with me that night, so I said maybe it was the 16th? And he agreed. Seems like he isn’t even sure. Can I just point out that on the 16th he went for DINNER AND TO THE CINEMA but had football during the day, which means he must of done it after football training and then stopped before food and cinema. I really don’t get how someone can so casually use c0ke before the cinema etc and then just stop. He said he doesn’t affect him and he only done “few c0rners”. This isn’t the point. I cant get over how he has not only lied to himself about improving his life, he has out right lied to my face. He would call me crazy and say stop asking him its doing his head in and annoying him “of course” he hasn’t done it at football and at the snooker hall, kept going on about how peaceful the cinema and food night was and he doesn’t go out anymore, little did I know he was doing a few “corners” that was offered to him before cinema/ I CANT GET OVER IT, SHOCKED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. Its SO hard because this is the first bf I have had that would do absolutely anything for me, puts me first, wants to make me smile, I can tell the way he looks at me he adores me, I just think he is surrounded by these friends. He also says that he has never been popular and doing this has helped him become popular, and he likes to give this impression to his friends that he is “jack the lad”. My aunt died from drugs, I don’t want to become a babysitter. I also don’t want to tell my bf he cant go out with his friends, he needs to be strong enough to say no, he said he has deleted all the numbers off his phone, he is sorry that he ever jepordised us blablabla. 

wasting my time? Apart from that, he is pretty much perfect….He says he only does it as its infront of him and he thinks its funny why not sort of attitude…

I'm very sorry to bother you with this but I am just dead tired and done with all the panick attacks that I have daily. 

I'm 22F. My so is 24M
He is from Australia, I'm from Belgium.
I'm depressed and have very very bad thoughts. I'm going to therapy.
I work 40+ hours a week. Same as my partner. My partner is a great one and very understanding and sweet. However my fear if getting ahead of me.


I wrote him something to talk about soon but idk if it might help him



I firmly believe I am not being a good partner to you and I am very ashamed and sorry for that.


Because of that I am afraid that you will leave me, since you won't find happiness or positivity with me anymore. You will find it in gaming with ""female friend name"" 

Also because of this I feel scared you will talk with your (in my eyes) almost perfect ex. I am letting these fear driving me crazy to the point of panick attacks and crying.

I am very scared of sharing this with you because I don't want you to see me as weak or ""less of a partner"" because then the above might happen and I will push you away with this. (That has happened before to me)

I am scared that I am not ready for a relationship yet that is so settling down. I don't know who I am anymore and I miss my old self.

I am panicking and am afraid so many times because of this that it has caused me to resent you for the choice that I made. It feels often like I am dead inside.

I do not know what to do with my life anymore and if I still want to live it. I do not have goals anymore or fun because the fear is just overwhelming. 

I need to work on this in therapy and I need to find myself again.
I am scared that I will hurt you in this process and that I might push you away.

tl;dr: 
About 4 months ago I was always worrying about the fact that he might not actually love me even though I had no reason to think that way it almost felt like I had no control over those thoughts. I still feel that way but its getting easier to convince myself I'm being crazy and to let it go, so I no longer verbalize my worries to him and he's happy to see that I'm sure. 

About a month ago I was laying on the couch at his place trying to get rid of my headache. He was sitting on the couch on my phone, (he is on it quite often and I don't mind as I have nothing to hide, my phone is his phone same with the other way around) his phone was sitting next to him so I took his and went to his Reddit page (hoping he doesn't see this) about a minute later, if that, he takes his phone back and walks off saying he needs to, ""look something up."" I personally called BS on this but didn't say anything. 

2 weeks ago, he got an innocent text from his female coworker, of course I didn't care, he's allowed to have female friends and it's not like I saw anything 'fishy' anyway and if I did I would say something, he simply cleared the message as he was with me and didn't feel a need to reply at that moment.

Yesterday, I was with him and he left his phone in the room so... I know I shouldn't do it, but I picked up his phone to see exactly how regularly they talked, sure enough, there was a message from her that he had cleared from him notifications and it sat in his messages unopened. I wished I would've opened it myself to see if he was talking about anything out of the ordinary. 

I want to talk to him about it, but I don't want him to think I'm simply over thinking again and that I haven't totally, ""recovered"" I guess you could say. I never thought about him cheating on me though. This is a first. Although I feel he wouldn't do it for sexual reasons, I feel he might fall for someone other than me... What do I do? I don't want him to be afraid of telling me things because of how anxious I am.

I have been diagnosed with anxiety, paranoia and depression, but recently overcame my depression 😁 go me. I have never been mediated as I feel I should be able to deal with it myself. 

I have over thought too much in my past and I'm unsure if this is it manifesting itself again, or if I actually have something to worry about. This is the best relationship I've had so maybe I think it's just too good to be true? I need feedback here😅

t2_61np6,1553787845.0,b6kdj1,t3_b6kdj1,3,"Hey, thanks for clicking, I could use some anonymous advice. I'm a 20 year old college student. I major in jazz drum set, and music takes up a lot of my time. I play in a band, 2 school jazz ensembles, host a radio show, write and record my own music, and take classes. On top of this, I also work two nights a week part-time. On a usual weeknight this semester, the earliest I will get home is at around 9:30. I'm very busy with a mix of classes, rehearsals, and gigs.

I met my girlfriend, let's call her ""Sabrina,"" on Tinder a month ago. We went out to eat, back to my house, and made out. The night after, she came to see me perform. She then went away for a few days, but came back to a fun night, and we officially became boyfriend and girlfriend. We almost immediately laid out what we wanted in a relationship, and we both agreed that casual wasn't our thing, and we were looking for something meaningful and long-term. I was really happy. I'd felt that I'd finally found the girl I had been looking for.

I have a complicated past with relationships.

I've had seven girlfriends and many more flings. Each relationship has not lasted very long, the longest being nine months in high school, but we had broken up then gotten back together. I have never made it to four months without splitting up, and I'm definitely realizing that I'm the common thread. My last girlfriend had Borderline Personality Disorder, and once we split, I felt like I had been manipulated into dating her. I've had a consistent streak of dating ""crazy"" (according to my mom) girls. I think I have some sort of commitment or self-sabotage issues. I'll get the relationship that I want, and then after a short amount of time, my mind will convince myself that I don't want it anymore, yet I still constantly seek out a relationship. It's frustrating. Two days ago, I was in a bad mood, worried about an exam, a rehearsal, etc. and she was worried about me, so she saw me during her break. I was really in my head, and I laid everything out for her. I have to be honest with her. I told her that I am scared of a long-term relationship, that I've been damaged by previous girlfriends that I've had, and that I often tend to see being single as a sort of comfort zone. She took it well, and comforted me, saying that it's okay and holding my hand. I went to rehearsal, then called her after (once I was feeling better) and apologized. She said I have nothing to apologize for.

Last night, she actually met my father for the first time. He visited up from my home state, and took us out to dinner. It was a really fun time, my dad likes her, and we all laughed a lot. I was feeling good. We came back to my house, turned on Lord of the Rings, and had sex. It was good, but after we'd finished, the thoughts came pouring back in my mind again. She noticed and asked if I was okay. I shook my head no, then we talked about it. I reiterated to her that I'm scared of hurting her. I told her that I think I have the tendency to sabotage myself once I get what I want. She asked if she needed to be worried about me hurting her, and I hesitated for a long time before saying no. She said that she too has been through a lot of bad things and was scared of being alone. She then said that if she were to go back to ""that place,"" that she doesn't know what she would do, and I saw a tear fall from her eye. She was in a messed up relationship for a year and a half (She was 15, he was in college, and took advantage of her). We woke up together this morning, then I drove her to campus.

Sabrina is a girl that I'm happy to be dating. She meets the high expectations that I've set for a partner, she's insanely supportive, funny, smart, talented, and I find her attractive. I, however, am swamped with responsibilities, I have a consistent marijuana habit and she doesn't smoke, and I'm worried that a long-term relationship with her will take up time that I don't really have. Plus, there are four to six weeks left in the semester, then I go back home, three hours away from her, to work two jobs over the Summer and only see her a few times. I don't know if a long-term relationship, despite being what I've wanted (and still want!) for a long time would be beneficial for me.

I'd really appreciate any response you might have.

Full disclosure, never built a deck before but I’ll have some knowledgeable friends helping out. Right now just in the planning / information collection stage and looking to take care of as much of this step as possible.

It’s going to be a freestanding deck, and my goal is to have it be mostly ground-level, however my back door is at just over 3 feet above the ground, so there would need to be steps coming down to the ground-level portion. 

My local code requires that any deck above 2 feet needs concrete piers down to below the frost line, but if the deck is below 2 feet high then deck blocks can be used. I would ideally like to use deck blocks on the lower portion, but the upper portion requires concrete piers.

Is it possible to use deck blocks for the lower portion and concrete piers for the upper portion? I’m worried about some differential movement between the two portions, and the effect that would have on the stairs connecting the two. 

Should I just suck it up and do concrete piers for the entire deck to avoid any possible complications to the deck? 

Also, I want to build a privacy fence on the side of the lower portion, so would that necessitate concrete piers as well because of potential wind loads, etc.?

The house I moved into last year has a bedroom where one of the closets must have had an older style sliding door that was from the floor to the ceiling. It looks like finding a similar door style is expensive or difficult and I prefer the look of a standard bi-fold like [this](https://www.amberyin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Bi-Fold-Doors-Hardware-Heavy-Duty.jpg).

I've been trying to find guidelines online but I'm not sure what to do because the one wall comes out a bit.

As you can see, I just have a curtain for now, but it's an eye sore.

My thoughts are header and frame, then drywall top, add trim and get a bi-fold door to fit. But how do I handle this in my wall situation? This might be more common than I thought, but never have seen it before.

t2_8g866,1553044372.0,b35ozl,t3_b35ozl,3,"Hi all,

Recently I've picked up a couple rusty tools and wanted to try out electrolysis instead of my usual vinegar bath and steel wool/file routine.

It all seems pretty simple and reasonably cheap except for the power supply. Most builds I've seen use some kind of car battery charger but it needs to be the manual variety. Something like that just doesn't seem to be available from the stores near me and the options online are too pricey for me expecially since I only really want it for this one task. A lot of the builds suggest picking one up in a car boot sale or something like that which just isn't really a thing near me and obviously not a guarentee.

So looking into it seems all I really need is a AC to DC power supply and there are a number on Amazon for much more reasonable prices (£14ish) like the one below 

https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B079BR75SF/ref=psdc_430514031_t1_B072J97N8T

Can someone with more knowledge on these things let me know if that's a suitable power supply? I notice it is rated for 30 amps and a number of builds I've seen previous are only running at 3-10 amps so is this overkill? Also I notice this power supply seems to have a number of protection features like short circuit protection so I'm wondering if that means it won't be suitable for electrolysis as that's basically what it's doing? Does the lack of amp control pose a problem?

With electrolysis itself I've read that the amount of water or the size of the part will require more current? The main piece I'm looking to de rust is a large record vice so am I in danger of blowing any fuses/melting something with such a large piece?

Also the rebar I've source for the positive anodes are only 8mm in diameter which seems smaller than a lot of the other builds I've seen. Will that be a problem? I was just thinking I'd get less use out of them?

Apologies for all the questiosn and if this has all been answered before I did do a search and read a number of posts/builds on this subreddit but none seemed to answer my specific questions and googling tended to bring back stuff about hair removal instead...

t2_khekb2h,1553001668.0,b2xc42,t3_b2xc42,12,"Hi, I'm trying to apply [GILA window film](https://www.lowes.com/pd/GILA-Heat-Control-48-in-W-x-15-ft-L-Platinum-Gray-Platinum-Heat-Control-Window-Film/1183687) to a 19.5x12.5"" pane of glass. The glass is loose, so to speak. That is, it's not attached to anything as you might see in videos about ""[how to apply window film](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+apply+window+film)"".

&amp;#x200B;

Well, after a solid 10 tries (nine with acrylic and one with glass) I seem to be no better at applying window film. My first few mistakes were because of dust getting caught under the film. Now I have that taken care of because I clean thoroughly. But also now my problem seems to be the film crinkling as I'm putting it on and, of course, bubbles.

&amp;#x200B;

A huge part of the problem seems to be that the film wants to curl itself back up. During some stages of the process I can put weights on the film to prevent it from curling but when you are removing the backing layer and applying the film to the glass the film curls and sticks to itself and never goes on the glass flat. I always have to lift the film back up to try and straighten it only to eventually end up creating a crease/crinkle where the film has stuck to itself. ...Maybe part of the problem is I'm doing this with the glass parallel to the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

This is crazy labor intensive for me. Each try is like an hour long. So, yes, I've spent at least 10 hours trying and failing at this one ""simple"" task. I've seen four or five videos and a how to article or two but none of them are helping.

&amp;#x200B;

Another problem I have is squeegeeing. For one, I get bubbles instantly and I really have to squeegee  hard and repeatedly to get them out. Sometimes I create creases while squeegeeing out the bubbles.. I think a lot of these squeegee issues would be somewhat mitigated if I could just get the film on flat and straight.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice for a hopeless window film application technician?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**edit -** I'm thinking maybe instead of trying to put the film on the mirror I should try putting the mirror on the film. That way I can keep the sheet flat with weights. Then I'll flip it around and do the squeegeeing. This will involve some tight grips on a thin sheet of glass which I neither want to smudge nor cut myself on. Any advice about how to avoid smudges and cuts while maintaining enough dexterity to manipulate the film and glass?

**edit2 -** on second thought, I have some [suction cups](https://www.harborfreight.com/4-1-2-half-inch-diameter-suction-cup-40993.html) lying around that I could probably use to manipulate the glass. ...okay, I feel good about this.

](https://imgur.com/a/l7LYCOe)

I tried using a chisel to kind of open up the head a little bit, then hammered a screw driver in to make sure it was set deep as possible and used a wrench to help turn it, but the head was stripping after a quarter turn.  I figure the process of beating the slot open with a chisel weakened the screw.

My other idea is to use a multi tool to try to recut the screw head, and I'm going to try that tomorrow, but I worry about the blade jumping around and making everything worse.

Anybody have any other ideas?  Or am I screwed?

Also, anybody know why the fuck?  I mean seriously, who makes it so you can't remove a screw?


UPDATE: Problem solved.  I took an old Craftsman screwdriver, from back when they were made in the good ol' US of A, and hammered it sideways into the slot to open the head, then I used a driver and very slowly spun the screw loose.  For screws where the slots weren't horizontal and I could only get in from one end, I used a Dremel to clean up the other side.  For the one I started last night and stripped, I chiseled away at the wood around the head and use vice grips to twist the screw out.

- **Wires, cables and connectors**

    Originally there was no such connector and the [wires were just soldered](https://imgur.com/a/jJNAptp).  
  - The [yellow connector](https://imgur.com/a/QjEG8pv) is using insulating tape while the original used [transparent rubber](https://imgur.com/a/EMlmgCW).  
  - Originally there was no insulating tape over the [thermal protection 'jacket'](https://imgur.com/a/KqqRrfz).

- **Minor differences between the electric motors**  
  - The coil of the new motor is 'exposed' while in the original there is some kind of ['tape protection'](https://imgur.com/a/rxUNnj0).  
  - The new motor has a shaft thicker than the original motor, which required a [new propeller](https://imgur.com/a/LrdxH7d).  
  - The [shaft's bevel](https://imgur.com/a/SXW72td) was extended in order to keep the propeller at the same original height and not touching the top case.  

**Questions**  

Considering I'm not an expert on the topic, I still feel somewhat insecure to turn on the boiler. Things get pretty hot near the radiator and I'm not sure I have protected everything properly:

- What is the purpose of the 'tape protection' over the coil of the original electric motor? Should I reproduce that on the new electric motor?  
- The insulating tape I've applied should be able to withstand the heat?  
- The distiller was properly repaired and reassembled? Is it reasonable to expect that it should last again for several years? Is it safe to use it like that?

So last week my (now ex) boyfriend decided to end our long distance relationship because of my plans to live in another country for 6 months come this fall. 

We dated normally for about 8 months and then had switched to long distance for the last 4, but we are only about 5 hours apart and in the same time zone. Things were going pretty well and we visited each other as much as we could, but the looming obstacle of a 9 hour time difference and upcoming responsibilities in each of our lives caused him to seriously doubt his ability to be there for me emotionally and maintain a deep connection. I wasn’t super thrilled about ending things, as I had been really happy in the relationship and we communicated a lot, we were functioning well with distance etc. but at the end of the day I understood that it was probably for the best and we decided to remain close and reevaluate upon my return next year. It was a very amicable and well discussed break-up so I wasn’t too distraught but still fairly disappointed.  

Well, some unexpected life events happened and I’m now unable to leave in a few months like I originally planned, and will likely be staying where I’m at for at least the next few years. 

Now I’m torn, because I am still very much into the idea of starting our relationship up again and last time we talked he explicitly said me leaving was the one thing stopping him from being willing to put in the effort right now. He was worried about me overextending myself trying to hold up a relationship he was apprehensive about since an inevitable break was looming. The one thing he couldn’t get past is no longer an issue, but how do I tell him that without making it seem like I’m doing the exact thing he didn’t want me to do and overcommitting to a relationship, when the decision had nothing to do with him ? 

I am going to see him in person next month so should I wait till then? Or try and talk to him before to see where we stand now that things have shifted around ?

t2_903emdk,1553800070.0,b6mvt5,t3_b6mvt5,42,"Last night my beloved mother injured herself for the first time really badly in her old age. Her recurring pain made her scream louder than I ever heard and when we (my brothers) came to help, her tears were flowing and she almost fainted because of the pain. 

My mom is a very tough woman for her age so this made us even more alarmed and shocked. We were scared that we might make things worse and also just struggled because she was being difficult to help due to the pain especially as she refused to allow an ambulance to come for her as she felt like she couldn't move.

My GF of 5 years (intended wife who loves me a lot) is an excellent doctor, so I called her for advice given the challenges. Soon before this incident we were having some relationship problems due to past issues making us hesitant to move forward, one of them for me is her coldness mentioned below and one main issue for her is me not being able to accept her fully because I struggle to be happy as an individual while with her (a very long story).

When I called her she got mad at me because we were struggling to take control of the situation but I understand she was just trying to help so that was fine with me especially as I got used to her having problems expressing herself and understanding my side of the story over the years.

Afterwards, when we managed to get the situation under control and I wanted to thank her for the effort over the phone she mentioned in a concerned manner that I need to toughen up.

I don't mind the sentiment because I believe we live in a world where it becomes a necessity to be tough, but here's the thing: she knows I'm not that kind of military-grade person. She knows I'm a lover, a very caring person, big on making the world a better place, a creative type into music and lots of other cool and fun stuff.

What bothered me was her timing. I found it extremely insensitive and in poor taste.
I would normally tell her but it was late and I didn't want to disturb her sleep for work with that drama. Were we so wrong for being shell-shocked by a first-time incident with those circumstances?

I've always had an issue with her being cold and self absorbed, it is just the way she has always been but I can guarantee you that she tries to be caring towards me ever since she realized I needed that kind of support from her.

I just don't feel safe with her because of this especially as she knows I have emotional scars from fighting my way out of years of depression. I feel like she will always misunderstand me and be cold to me and I'm just too warm of a person to feel ok with that. Seeing that she's such an amazing friend and lover aside from that I just need to decide if I can or cannot accept this part of her.

Generally, I think we can do great things together in life if we stop unintentionally hurting eachother.

Can you all please help me understand this dynamic so I can assess it fairly especially as we are trying to make decisions to move forward with our lives. It's been over 5 years now, let me assure that I have tried on my own and with her before giving reddit a chance. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and offer any help based on your experiences.

Throwaway because he's on Reddit too.

​

I need help knowing if a) I'm overreacting, and how do I get over this on my own? or b) this is a problem we both need to work on.

​

Some context: My boyfriend (21M) and I (20F) have been together for a year and a half. We're long distance, so we've spent a summer and every break during college together. I always knew that sex was really important to him. He has always had a really high sex drive which I have always easily kept up with and satisfied both together and apart. We've always been open to each other about porn, which I've never had a problem with in past relationships, or this one. Why would I if I watch it too?  We have watched it together and we have shared it while we were apart. 

​

For this past winter break I spent at his apartment. We had no problems between us, although he was stressed about his last semester of college coming up as well as waiting to hear back from a job offer. It was the night before my flight that was the following morning. He was going to shower, and normally right after we would have an extended time for foreplay and sex since I would be leaving tomorrow. Especially since we hadn't had sex for the past couple days. While he was showering, I started our laundry and cleaning our dishes that were around the apartment. Went to use the bathroom, but he had locked it. Which he had never ever done. He said ""oh, sorry!"" &amp; I heard him shuffle around and then unlock the door. I opened it and he had only just jumped in the shower, even though almost 10 minutes had gone by with the shower on. He also wasn't playing music from his phone which he always does. It was obvious he was watching porn and masturbating. It made me really uncomfortable, confused, and insecure immediately, but neither of us said anything about it which I really regret now. But the night went on and no sex happened. He was very overly sweet to me after that too, like he knew what he did was wrong and I was bothered by it. I really regret not confronting the situation in that moment but oh well.

​

I go home and the following weeks consisted of very little ""sexy time"" between us, whereas there would usually be a lot. I kept commenting on it and he just said he was stressed. But he's also told me that sex stuff relieves his stress a lot, so I just assume he's watching porn all the time instead of incorporating it between us like usual. I finally confronted him about what happened that one night and how it hurt me a lot, because it was the last night I was there and I didn't understand why he chose to do that. It was really hard for him to talk about, as it is an awkward topic, so it took like two days to fully get everything out of him about it. I felt bad but it made me really insecure, since I do so much for him sexually all the time. He confessed he does have a porn addiction, and it's how he copes with stress. He sees it as one of the healthier addictions to have, since it's not harmful. He told me about how he would just stay home and play video games that he can AFK and just watch porn on the side. He would watch it for hours and do it several times a day. He said he stopped at the beginning of our relationship for me (never told me this, he wanted to do this himself), but when we had a rough patch about a year ago he started up again. He told me he knows he needs to stop, and he knows that it hurt me, and he apologized. He told me that he would stop watching porn completely for me, and that instead we would increase our ""sexy times"" to help him relax. That meant a lot...but it didn't happen.

​

Now, two months later, I'm an anxious and insecure mess because anything sexual between us has withered away substantially. He doesn't ask for pictures anymore, he doesn't want to sext anymore, and anytime we have our ""sexy times"" is when I bring it up and he doesn't seem to really enjoy it like he used to. Now I'm constantly paranoid about not being enough or not being attractive. I'm paranoid when we hang up at night because he's probably just watching porn. I'm paranoid about how many times he's been doing that when I was with him instead of including me. since we don't get to be together very often. I understand that masturbation/porn is its own thing, but the amount of times I satisfy him is way more than how much he satisfies me, and that's one of the big problems. Recently I broke down in front of him about how insecure it has made me ever since I walked in on him, and he reassures me that it'll be okay, and that I have nothing to worry about. He says that now he just jerks off without porn, but he's told me before that he's not able to do that (""bad imagination""), so I don't believe him.

​

I don't know if I'm forgetting anything, and wow this was longer than I thought. Please help me through my thoughts on this. We're planning on him moving to my state after he graduates in a month, but I honestly don't want to live with this constant paranoia. And no, I don't watch porn anymore. I can't. I just see the women on there as women that he's watching and it makes me compare myself to them, adding to the insecurities.

​

**TL;DR:** After walking in on my long-distance boyfriend watching porn the night before I left to fly back home, I realized that he's had a porn addiction. He told me he would stop but has not offered any evidence or reassurance about it. It's made me incredibly paranoid and insecure. I want him to stop watching it completely now, even though I used to be okay with it. Do we need to properly address this together?

Friends before our relationship for a year and I fell in love incredibly fast.  Fully trusted her, was incredibly confident at the start, and I am a damn good man.  She is a great girl and we have immense potential.

We are both in professional school together and have very bright futures.  We are having issues right now (that I will admit I caused at this point).  The issues stem from two things:

1) My trust for her was broken due to inappropriate interactions with another colleague of ours who always makes sexual comments to her and is always going out of his way to playfully touch/joke with her directly in front of me.  She no longer reciprocates the flirting, but she did at first and I feel betrayed.  It has pissed me off on multiple occasions and everytime I see him I get pissed off and lose my loving feelings for her.  I told her about this and she made the initiative to stop it, but he continues to do things that cause massive issues (for me) in our relationship.  It has been affecting my sleep, my happiness, and my focus.

2) For the relationship to function, I would have to sacrifice some of my career goals.  She would not necessarily have to do the same.  I am becoming concerned about whether or not it is worth it because the risk is becoming very apparent to me.  I am having trouble focusing and I am not having my needs met lately.


I just today told her about the trust issues I am having.   She has been very respectful since the initial incident, but this guy is a creep and won't fuck off.  I have now said something about this guy 3 times.  The worst part is, I fully consider myself ""better"" than this guy, and I am extremely fed up of dealing with it.

I want ""us"" back, but I am concerned that our recent problems have made it to a ""point of no return"".  I want some outside perspective.

I'm  getting married in 6 months to a woman who loves to me to death, and I  love her the same.  Been together five years and otherwise have a great relationship bar this huge issue for me.

&amp;#x200B;

When  we first met I had ended an engagement that was a long distance  relationship that had been falling apart for some time.  She was an  acquaintance of mine at the time and remembers me mentioning the breakup  and how it had made me sad, mostly because I felt like I had wasted  both of our time not living up to my own expectations of myself.

&amp;#x200B;

She  remembered this and really held it against me as our relationship  progressed, feeling like I was the needy type that was always willing to  settle, and that maybe I was doing the same with her.  This girl is  also far more attractive than the previous ex and I feel that messed  with her ego to see herself as an equal in my eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

Over  the relationship if anything reminded her of my ex she would flip on  me, whether it took days or weeks, it would come out in a very unhealthy  way.  Days of fighting, screaming at me and showing me pictures  demanding I say I was an idiot and should be ashamed.  Multiple fights  happened where she would just shut off emotionally entirely after  flipping out and these fights never really resolved.   She would just  lose energy, apologize and we would move on with me burying all of the  frustration and anger under the carpet.  Only in the last 12 months or  so has this stopped.  I've been taking this shit for years for the sake  of the relationship and completely ignoring my own issues with her.

&amp;#x200B;

When  she was young she was one of those hot, but insecure girls with major  daddy issues that liked to be the loud obnoxious girl that would do  anything for attention.  When we first met she was very up front about  not wanting a serious relationship and even bragged about orgies,  threesomes, drug-fueled parties, using men for money and gifts and proud  of how often she savagely cheated on her ex.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless  to say this was the sum of all my biggest fears to find out about  someone later on down the road, but hey, I got it all right up front.   Oddly, because of this I approached the relationship without hesitation  of being myself, blunt and pushed this aside as this was now obviously a  rebound situation anyways.   Due to my fearless approach of  not-giving-a-fuck the chemistry in the relationship actually ended up  working out.

&amp;#x200B;

As  the relationship got more serious her issues with my past became a huge  problem and I was never able to deal with how I felt about hers other  than a few outbursts that she probably thought were just retaliatory.   I've mentioned it as an issue before but I can't get specific enough  about the shit that actually crosses my mind and how often it happens.

&amp;#x200B;

She  knows it is an issue and has brought it up recently, acknowledging how  much of a shitty person she at times was before me, how lost and low  self-esteem she was and why she felt ashamed at all of that.   This was  all unprompted by me.

&amp;#x200B;

I  don't have as much an issue with the sexcapades as much as an issue I  have with the flaws in her personality that led her down that path.  Now  before anyone goes on a rant about me being insecure and slut-shaming  it isn't that.   I've had my own somewhat wild sexual past, including  multiple partners at once, am a good looking, tall dude and am well  endowed.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm  not worried she had more fun than me, or that maybe her ex and her had  some swinging fun.  What I picture is that in a social situation she  gets insecure and compensates wayyyyy too hard, wanting to dominate,  showoff and willing to do wild shit and create a situation like that  where none existed.

&amp;#x200B;

This  to me is a risk if she is traveling for work, finds herself drinking  with male coworkers and in the past has had very shitty boundaries and  obviously this is part of her sexual appetite.  Even when we were first  together two different times she suggested threesomes with no discussion  with me prior.

&amp;#x200B;

Also  of mention, prior to me she only dated and enjoyed fucking men of a  race different than me, and on occasions made this preference very  clear.  Her mother is racist and likely why a serious relationship in  that path would never work, making me feel like there are guys you fuck,  and guys you marry, and I'm just one to be settled with.

&amp;#x200B;

Because  of all of this I have a hard time not comparing myself to the wild shit  she likely misses.  It makes it hard to initiate regular sex without  feeling fucking silly or pretending that fucking 2-3 times a week at the  exact same time, same day, same way is what she wants.

&amp;#x200B;

This  has me overthinking shit, I get frustrated, resentful of her past,  resentful of how she has treated me with mine and I just keep this all  to myself.   Even when she brought it up I said nothing, just nodded my  head and let her talk.  I need to get this out because I am getting  panic attacks.  

&amp;#x200B;

I love this girl, I want to be with her, I just need to  be able to trust her, the changes she has made over the last 5 years and  feel like I can tell her this without breaking up and address how I  feel without feeling weak or exposed.  I also want us to be more sexually expressive without the fear of triggering the other's fears.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is how can better accept her when she has had trouble accepting me, for something much less controversial?  How can I set this resentment aside of being unfairly shamed and not look at her and feel that way about her now?   I hate looking at something I like about her and feeling that at some point it was made very cheap and impulsively so by her.  I hate having to fight the idea that my supposed queen was happily remembered by many others as something much cheaper, easy, saw her when she was feeling worthless, exposed (specific to her scenario and what was going on in her life at the time).

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Getting married soon, fiancee shamed me for years over my ex being ugly.  I now have repressed all of my own insecurities about her wild past that she happily bragged about but now acts ashamed of now that she gets the scope of the impact it has had on our relationship.  Having a hard time trusting if we are both real at all about our desires, I know I'm certainly not trusting enough of her reaction to be open, though she has been very forthcoming lately and I need help growing the fuck up.

He asked me to say it again and I said I think you already know how I feel about you.

My partner has a degree, but no experience in the field. I have a degree and 2-3 years experience. Jobs in our field are competitive, with employers sometimes receiving 100-300 applications for a single position. 

Last week, we both received a phone interview. My partner thought he nailed it, and instantly bragged. I did my best, and didn't think much of it. This week, I received a call and a request for an in-person interview. My partner received... nothing, despite the interviewer stating they would follow up regardless of the outcome. I knew this, and before I accepted the second interview, sat him down and asked how he would feel if I interviewed and potentially recieved it. He said it would be fine.

But my interview is today, and he is not fine. I mentioned I had a few errands to run before it, and he had an instant mood change and shut down. I walked into a vocal discussion he was having with his mother about it being a good opportunity for me, but him being angry about not getting a call. I don't want to potentially sign on today, (it's the final round, my errand is printing references), and bring anger/resentment into our relationship. That being said, it was a fair contest, and I did apply us BOTH, he didn't apply himself.

Obviously distraught, I reached out to a friend of mine whose only response has been, “I’m sorry to hear that” or “I’m sorry you’re not feeling well.” Maybe I’m wrong, but when your friend of nearly 15 years tells you there’s a significant chance that they won’t live to see the end of this year, wouldn’t you ask questions? Be concerned? Tell them you love them or respond in kind when they say it to you? 

Under no circumstances do I want a pity party or expect this person to drop their life and cater to me. It just that they don’t care. In my mind, “I’m sorry you don’t feel well” is what you say to someone with a head cold, not malignant tumors. What’s even more odd is that until I told them about the recurrence six months ago, everything was great. But once I did, every response I’ve gotten has been very curt (for lack of better wording) or just extremely out of character.

I’m not sure what I should do here. Am I overreacting? Should I confront this friend? I’m scared because I don’t want to continue getting worse w/o clearing the air, but I also want/need to spend what energy I have focusing on finishing school and taking care of myself.

The relationship was beginning to go downhill really fast after he told me that he basically was “ young &amp; hasn’t experienced anything fr yet and is scared of what life has for him and for the both of us “ .. After he said this , we broke up for like .. a day but he ended up apologizing , saying that he didn’t need to experience life , he has all he needs. Sweet right? Well then, in this support group chat for army wives and girlfriends , there began an expose session of some of the husbands and A LOT of them had cheated during AIT and within their first year at their duty station .. My boyfriend had been emotionally shut off with everyone since he got in training and of course . I tried to maintain the relationship, putting in 90% while he of course was putting in 10.. I felt myself starting to build up resentment , we began arguing all of the time , barely wanted to speak to one another ( on his end more so ) and I’d tell him what I wanted out of this relationship and he basically would tell me he couldn’t be that man for me .. At least for right now , his focus has shifted towards his career and he wants stability before making any long term decisions . We had definitely discussed marriage and stuff before , multiple times, enthusiastically . But about a week ago I brought up his desire to “ experience “ and we both came to an agreement that we need a break . A breather . I even accepted the fact that he’ll flirt with other girls , probably even sleep with them too because thats what his friends are doing .. And he’s a young man in the army who is around a bunch of people..I’m not delusional. He may be one of the nicer guys out of the bunch BUT he is still a young MAN.. I just told him I want him to be able to marry me without the need to go and experience someone else during the marriage .. I don’t want to worry about cheating . He says he’s just focused on graduating and trying to get his shit together , he isn’t really thinking about girls like that .

Now , here is the bad part .. A guy friend who I ideally had no kind of sexual or deep emotional feelings for came in the picture in December . We would talk , I’d go and get him sometimes and take him to get a rello or some pods for his JUUL , little shit like that . Nothing ever really serious and he had just gotten cheated on and left for a dude in the Navy (ironic huh?). He was pretty down about it, smokes his depression away all of the time .. But I was being a friend . We’d talk and everything . After my boyfriend and I broke up , I went over and talked to him about it . Asked him what he thought you know ? My friend had been there emotionally for me the entire time while my boyfriend was being neglectful . He started to say things like “ you deserve better , you’re so beautiful “ .. My boyfriend made me feel like he had gotten tired of me ... I felt unwanted by him and wanted by this guy in a short frame of time ... Things got intense extremely fast . No this was NOT planned at all ... It isn’t what I wanted , This all happened a week while me and my boyfriend had broken up . It was like .. emotional healing for the both of us .. At least in my head because although the barrier for emotional safety between my boyfriend and I had been broken , leaving space for feelings to grow for other parties had successfully been filled , I still didn’t see a future with this guy . I saw maybe a short term rebound kind of deal . After this hookup happened , he looked at me and said that “ we shouldn’t be doing this “ I agreed and began to cry .. Had a whole break down .. I felt bad afterwards because I was only doing this to fill a void, I knew that .. Even though I do have love for the guy and he said he loves me and doesn’t want either of us to feel used and he eventually wants to be together . We’ve known each other for roughly 3 years , but I am sure this is just infatuation ... We had a fling back in high school but he ended up choosing someone else over me, which he regrets now because its the ex that he was cheated on by. He looks at me like he admires me and he is so attentive .. He gets high all of the time which is probably why he is so sweet half of the time .. I don’t know , I’m pretty sure we both know we’ve crossed a boundary that wasn’t meant to be crossed .. At least for right now . My (ex)boyfriend and I talked last night , he basically says he is enjoying the break ... He is trying to get this training shit out of the way and everything ... I asked has he experienced things yet and he said no he hasn’t ... Doesn’t plan to but I’m asking questions he hasn’t really gotten confronted by yet . Anyways... I mentally decided to not have sex with this guy anymore . For what ? It made me feel awful ... I love my ex .. He told me he has the desire to come back &amp; plans on it .. in a month or so . Possibly . We said no longer than 2 . I just want him to be sure . Question is , should I disclose my hookup with this guy to him ? He said he doesn’t know if he’d be hurt or not if I did something like this because he hasn’t really thought that far ahead but I KNOW he’ll be hurt . Truth is , I’d never think to do something like this if I felt wanted by him . I’ve been faithful to him my entire relationship and only longed for the same emotional support I was giving to him . I need help you guys . What do I do ? What am I feeling ?

Mobile, formatting bad, yknow the deal.

My ex and I have gotten together near the beginning of May last year, and before that we've been friends for roughly three years or so, things are great for a while, until high school happened. When we got our schedules I had no classes with her and didn't even have the same lunch shift as her. We tried to squeeze in time in the mornings and the few minutes going from our locker to the bus ramp. She also recently had to be working during the weekends to not live on the street because she grew up with a deadbeat dad, terrible sister, broke home stuff. That took up a majority of her weekends, and when she wasn't working she was doing chores or homework, so she never had any time to maintain a relationship.

 This went on from the beginning of winter break to roughly a week ago, a cycle of wanting to hang out, never hanging out, thinking I did something wrong because anxiety exists, and being reassured by her that I did nothing wrong. On Monday, she decided to break things off to figure out life, and you can't force a relationship so I agreed, and I feel like such an asshole for doing this, tried to still make some reconnection after considering that she just can't deal with that stuff right now, and yesterday she cut communication between us outside of school. This meant that we can't really see each other at all if she chooses not to. 

One of the people who I trust most in this world, I couldn't even see their face. It's just been picking me apart and usually I always go to worst case scenario, but now that there's a chance I could never see her again, my brain want to be optimistic, and hold on to the memories we shared. I still trust her, and if she says we both needed this, we both needed it. I'm holding on to that bit of hope, and I don't wanna let go until we can talk again, she means too much to me. My question is what can I do to fill the time? She probably wants to cut it for a month or so, and I need something to fill this void.

*Skip to the end for a brief TLDR, but if you’re curious keep reading*

I’ve had anxiety ever since I was 9 years old, and that ranged from panic attacks, social anxiety, phobias, obsessive compulsive thinking, depersonalization and agoraphobia (fear of public places). 

I often feel like people don’t understand the severity of my anxiety because it’s also a basic descriptor of emotion that everyone feels from time to time, but my anxiety took me out of school for three years, hospitalized me for a year and I’ve been seeing mental health professionals for 10 years now! I was on medication for ten years until a month ago now (Horray) when I finally decided it was time to do it on my own. 

BUT THIS ISN’T MEANT TO BE A MENTAL HEALTH POST 

This post is about my romantic relationship and how my mental health is/has effected it.

If my anxiety problems were 9/10 growing up I would say they sit at about a 3/10 now with occasional 6/10 flare ups. 

My boyfriend works in the trades while I’m a student (works retail in summers); we don’t live together and we hangout probably 3-4 times a week! He’s super social, creative, hard working and kind. But he also is an extremely empathetic person meaning * he is very susceptible to my emotions. *

And here I am, aware of how much he loves me, and how much of an empath he is, continuing to be negative about my mental health recovery. This is why I am a horrible girlfriend.

I can tell sometimes that when I mention I’m particularly anxious, or sensitive, his face sinks a little and he doesn’t seem to enjoy our time together as much. He sometimes gets upset for his own reasons but I truly believe at these times it’s my fault he gets upset.

Recently I found out he’s been keeping things from me like how he’s feeling on a given day, or what he needs (sex, his mood, space, distraction, etc.). He says sometimes he just doesn’t want to make me more anxious or more sad. And it really scared me that he’s been distant with me and so I started hiding that I was upset, so he wouldn’t be upset on my behalf. This just made me feel more compressed, and I felt like I had no one to talk to.

Speaking of talking to people— here’s my support system situation: my mom, my boyfriend and about three other close friends. Unfortunately my closest friends are also students and we all only really hangout when we do study seshes at the library so we don’t talk about our feelings a lot. I am currently seeing a therapist every two weeks. 

TLDR:
My boyfriend is the sun, and I am like a black hole sucking the life out of him because I still have decently bad anxiety.

I'm in a strange predicament where I don't know how to go about it. There is this girl that I've known for about ten years now we are both 27 (I'm a dude btw). She lives out of state as well. Over these past ten years we've gone through a lot of ups and downs and helped each other out constantly. We each considered ourselves each other best friends similar interests and what not and talk almost every day. She has been through A LOT like traumatic stuff with past relationships. Anyways a few months ago I confessed straight out in a novel of a text wall (after a few drinks) how I feel about her and everything just spilled out on the page so to speak. I knew probably the response I was going to get that she didn't want to invest a relationship with anyone and just focus on herself right now. Which I understand and I'm okay with honestly. At the same time I constantly think about her and what could be. She's a really independent woman has a plan in life, goals and shes gorgeous. I'm just a dude that just coastin' by still trying to figure things out and I'm a bigger dude thats okay looking. Even if she was looking for someone I feel like as much as I want it I wouldn't be right for her ya know? I always think about trying to explore and to try and date again (it's been 3-4 years since I went on a date last) but I feel like even if I did find someone that would date all I would think about is her. One I feel like I'm robbing myself for happiness or two even if she was looking I feel like I wouldn't be the one she would be looking for. So I'm lost and just wanted to vent out about it.

ackground: for a year and a half I dated a guy on and off who of course, initially seemed great, but would randomly leave me, cheat on me, talk to his exes, degrade me, mock me, insult me, and constantly neg me until I began to believe I couldn’t do better. Around him, I constantly felt insecure, unsafe, unloved, and like I was never good enough for anything.

It’s been about a year since things ended for good between us. Recently, (a bit over a month ago) I met a guy. So far, he’s great. He makes time for me, doesn’t spend all his time at the bar, he is very family oriented, gives me advice and motivation when I need it, takes genuine interest in me and makes me feel good about myself.

We started off seeing each other constantly...I told him we should pump the brakes and relax a bit, focus on dating, have less sleep overs. He agreed. Nonetheless, we didn’t see each other for a few days and since then he’s wanted to hang out three times and we have and we had fun.

Despite my hurt and issues with trust, I do initiate a lot, I’m very kind and willing to put myself out there. However, all these little things make me doubt his true feelings for me.

For one, his family came to town for a weekend; he didn’t tell his mom about me and went so far as to tell me not to talk when she called, but apologized saying he hasn’t gotten around to telling her yet. To be fair, I haven’t exactly been telling everyone either, but still- it’s just how it makes me feel.

Secondly, we agreed on being sexually and romantically exclusive (he actually brought up the romantic part) so I deleted my tinder but I noticed he didn’t. I brought it up and he said he has, but left it at that. I don’t trust it.

Thirdly, he plays adult softball. I said I wanted to go to a game but he didn’t invite me to any of them. And yeah, it’s a co-Ed team.

t2_j5j6w,1553780480.0,b6ixgf,t3_b6ixgf,4,"This is going to be a doozy, probably very long, ranty, and disorganized. Sorry for that. 

To start, I met my ex(I'll call him C) online, and our relationship was entirely long distance, so if you think this kind of relationship is less valid than the norm, I don't really want to hear it. Thank you. 

We met when we were 14 and by the end of that year, we were together. No relationship is perfect, and we were obviously very young, so we made a lot of mistakes, but we were generally happy. We worked through mistakes, arguments, etc. and by the time we were 18, things were good. We'd started plans to move in together, from basically opposite ends of the country, knowing it would be tough but determined to make it happen. 

Near the end of 2016, he started to cheat on me. This person was also long distance, but closer, and this is one of the plethora of (inconsistent)reasons he gave me for doing what he did. This went on for about 2 weeks before he told me what was going on. He told me he was cheating(Didn't put it that way, but that's what was happening), but that he was devoted to me and he would tone down his time with this other person. This obviously greatly distressed me, but he seemed to expect me to just accept what he was doing and approve of him continuing to hang out with this person. Of course I didn't approve and told him that this person needed to go. He flatly refused, but I loved him deeply and he insisted nothing would happen, so I relented, which was a grave mistake. 

About a week after telling me, I bought him a gift. He told me that [person] already got him the same gift. I had a bit of a freak out. After being all cryptic and telling him that this situation was draining my will to live, I turned off my phone and basically didn't talk to him for the whole day, spending it with my brother instead.

At the end of the day, I texted him and he said we were done. Looking back, I knew deep down it was coming. Of course everyone says long distance doesn't work, cracks were forming in our plans, etc. I realize I was immature in dealing with this situation, but I still believe he was flatly wrong in what he did. If he'd wanted to pursue another relationship, I think I deserved confirmation before he did that. Either way, this is basically a prologue to what my more current problem is. 

Skip ahead to the beginning of 2018, we'd talked a couple of times throughout 2017, but the pain was very raw for me, and he seemed to be blaming me for things, so I'd decided to focus on other things; school, my brother's upcoming marriage, etc. At the beginning of the year, however, we got in contact. I was in what would turn out to be a temporary but fun relationship, and he was still with the person he'd cheated on me with. I forget who sent the first message, but I think it was me. I wanted to be friends again, and he seemed like he'd been wanting to talk to me too. 

This is fairly relevant context for some of my actions in the rest of the story, C is quite poor. He and his family get by, but he's never had much in the way of spending money. I'm middle class, in and out of part time jobs while going through college, and typically get money as gifts from various family members. Soon after we reconnected, I decided to get him a Christmas/birthday gift, as he'd mentioned that his laptop was failing. So I got him a laptop, I think it was about 300 dollars. Not that much, but I was unemployed at the time, so it was a good portion of the money I had on hand. 

This is fairly unimportant, but this is where I started to see a trend. For a couple of weeks after getting him this gift, we talked all the time and spent lots of time together. I felt like he was really my friend for a while. This didn't last long, and we were soon distant. I didn't mind this so much, as I was busy most of the time and I knew I wasn't any kind of priority for him anymore. Eventually, he opens up to me about how [person] doesn't seem to really care about him and misses the kind of affection and love I gave him. Keep in mind, my relationship ended a little while before, and I definitely still loved C. I took this as the start of us getting back together. He confided in me more than once, and he admitted that he still loved me too. 

After a couple of months, I guess he and [person] had a talk or became closer somehow, because he started to distance himself from me again. I was disappointed, but I didn't get too upset really, knowing he'd prefer not to end another relationship. We stayed distant through the summer, talking occasionally but not really being actual friends. 

Fast forward a bit to about October of 2018. 

My mother had been battling stage 4 breast cancer for almost a year now, and the last effective drug had begun to stop working. I tell C about this and he says that he wants to be there for me throughout this whole thing, and that he wronged me in the past and wants to atone for that. Mom was put on another experimental treatment, but it quickly proved to have little to no effect. She was moved into hospice. I went to C for support a lot during this time, and he helped me a few times, but mostly told me he didn't have time or patience enough to really care about my problems. I'm paraphrasing that, but he was very transparent in how little he could bring himself to care about me. 

I decided to stop asking for his support after a while, and mom died early this year. I was very close to my mother, so I was indeed very sad, but it had been coming for a while and I was glad that her pain had ended, so I rebounded pretty quickly. 

Here's where it really gets bad, and makes me seem like an ignorant child. I got inheritance from my mother. Not a ridiculous amount, but certainly more than I'd ever had before. C's birthday had been recently and I hadn't talked to him at all lately, so I decided that I needed to get him another gift. I spent about 2000 dollars on a few gifts for him. I rationalized this to myself, saying that he'd been there for me in the *really* rough times, even if he wasn't consistent, and that I hadn't gotten him a birthday or Christmas gift last year. I'm the type of person who loved giving gifts, not to imply I'm a very generous person, it's just something I enjoy, and again, I still very much loved C, in spite of everything. So again, repeating the trend from the last gift I'd gotten him, we were very close for a couple of weeks. He told me thank you all the time, hung out with me just about every day, and even said he loved me again, but specified it was in a platonic way. That's fine, I knew our romantic relationship was long gone, and I was having a great time just being friends again, very thankful for his friendship in my rough time. In the back of my mind, I suspected I was being taken advantage of though. 

Keep in mind that C is not any kind of greedy, and is always reluctant to accept gifts from me(Though I guess that could be a front since he knows I'll get him gifts anyway, but I don't think so). 

This brings us to now, he's again distancing himself from me. I feel kind of betrayed, as I thought we were going to be friends for keeps this time. He insists that he cares about me and wants to stay friends, and gets very defensive when I bring any of these feelings of doubt up with him. I also feel sick whenever he mentions his current SO, seeming to forget how their relationship came to be and what that might mean to me. I feel like I really should cut him out of my life and try to completely move on from all of the cheating and everything, but I just can't bring myself to. I love him and I want to be there for him even if he won't stick to being there for me when I need him. 

Not sure what to do. 

**TL;DR**(Very simplified): My ex acts like a friend after I give him gifts, but he's never really there when I need him despite him saying he wanted to be. I know I should leave him behind entirely, but I can't bring myself to do it. 

I really just want advice on any aspect of this huge rambling post, mainly from anyone who's successfully cut someone bad for them out of their lives.

Anyone who's actually willing to read this is an absolute angel. Thank you.

Throw away account for obvious reasons, but at the same time if my SO found this, this would be very obviously us, RIP. I am putting the TL;DR at the top, actually, so you understand what you're getting into.  
 

TL;DR: My SO and I are from two different countries. We have a really intense/deep committal relationship, and I don't want it to end. I have four months to ask him if he would maybe want to move to my country for the next 4 years or so so that I can finish schooling. I am really nervous on whether or not this is the type of relationship where such is appropriate/if I'm of age th I can be having this talk...nd if I am where to start.  
 

**The specific question(s):** Should I/how should I suggest my SO to come live with me in my home country while I finish schooling. Are we too young? Is this relationship normal enough? Is this too quick? Is this what people do? Help help help.  
 

**Background of this relationship in terms of ups and down**: In November of 2017 I matched with a foreign exchange student at my University. We never had a formal date, just met up and talked; developing the kind of friendship you have where you can just sit and talk for hours and never get bored/be content. He was hooking up with a good number of girls and we never did anything, not even kiss, until about a month into us knowing each other. From November of 2017-now we have been through a lot of growing and redefining. From November 2017-January 2018 we were just friends with benefits. January 2018-March 2018 we were exclusive. I asked him for an open relationship in March because I felt like I wasn't enough for him sexually/was wasting his time abroad to go wild and hook up with people. This hurt him, a lot, and we ended up breaking up and not talking for two weeks. We had a long conversation there after and got back together, and was in an open relationship until August 2018, which was when I told him how unhappy it made me to know he was with other people at the same time, and it was one sided. I wasn't honest with him on how much an open relationship hurts me and when that watershed moment happened he was mortified and we agreed to become exclusive starting when he got home because when his study abroad year ended by (actual, genuine, universe manifesting) coincidence I started my study abroad year two weeks later in September of 2018, not only in his home country but his home city. Since September of 2018 until now we have been exclusive.  
 

**Background of this relationship in terms of intensity:** So with my timeline of this relationship it can be seen we have known each other for almost a year and a half now. Since we've met we have done a lot. We have traveled within my country to different regions for weekends. We've celebrated 2.5 (this .5 is actually super relevant, it will come later) birthdays. I've met his family, he's met mine. We spent this past christmas and new years together, with his family. We have met and have frequently hung out with each others friends. When we were in my country it was a 20 minute walk from his place to mine. Now, even though we are a bit over 1hr from each other via metro, we still see each other at minimum once every three days or so, and if we can't see each other at all during the week we will spend the whole weekend with each other.  
 

**Really significant things we've done for each other:**

*Me for him*: We have both done a lot for each other, especially in this September 2018-now period. As I said, my SO and I met at my University. He was actually in the law school and I was in the undergrad program. If it wasn't for matching, our paths wouldve never crossed. As he was a law student he had to pass the bar after graduation in July of 2018. Unfortunately, he failed. So he had to fly back to my country in February of 2019 to retake it.....and I went with him. I have a relative who lives about 2 hours by car from the testing center, so we flew in, stayed with her for a week, and split the cost for the rental car and an AirBnB for the days surrounding the test, saving him money and stress. I drove him to the library to study every day, made and figured out meals, brought him lunch the day(s) of so he didn't have to deal with the rush of stressed hungry bar takers, rubbed his back all night the night before when he had anxiety attacks etc etc. We spent 12 days in a row with each other, never separating for longer than the hours of his bar exams and it felt so normal. We studied, ate, slept, drove through snow storms, etc together and made out with our relationship stronger than ever.  
 

*Him for me*: Last week today, my health took a sudden turn for the worst. Walking up three stairs winded me, I was hot and had chills, I lost my appetite, talking was exhausting. I didn't go to class, which is uncharacteristic of me, and just felt off. It wasn't until I passed out in my apartment twice from just trying to go to the bathroom that I realized I needed help, and fast. I was able to drag my body into bed and sent an SOS text to him basically. He came and at that point shit was dire. I was delirious and had a high fever and hadn't eaten or showered in over 24 hours. He hoisted me out of bed and gave me a bath, made me food, tried to get me to eat (unsuccessfully) and called my mom back home to say what was happening. He called the ambulance for me and off we went to the hospital. When I arrived we found out that I was dangerously low on something in my bloodwork. Lets just say the average person needs 12-15 counts of this and I had 2.5. I basically was over halfway dead. He stayed with me from 8pm Thursday to 8am Friday. He spoke to doctors for me of my medical history (dominating language is not English in this country, and while I can manage day to day definitley cannot while on verge of death), of which he knew of, kept my parents updated back home, held my hand and wiped the sweat off my forhead while nurses and doctors picked and prodded and asked questioned and onwards. I have since been stabilized and am on the mend, but still am in the hospital. He has been my hero. He spends the hour commute everyday to visit me from late afternoon until after dinner, has brought chess, checkers, watched videos and TV and read books to me. This whole health crisis happened three days before my birthday. On my birthday he came to the hospital with a 21 candle, a card, and a mini present, he got permission and a wheelchair from the nurses and got me outside for the first time in three days and ran me around the hosptial grounds outside because I was too weak to walk still. He said that it was all he can do for now, but when I get out we are going to truly celebrate. (.5 explained). Since then everyday he finds wheelchairs and runs me around outside for an hour and its my favorite part of everyday....Also since I am abroad and being hospitslized is cash money, he has also been advocating for me and has made me aware of and has been fighting for to his best capacity my rights, cause he luckily can do things like read thick texts of legal insurance policy. This experience is what has given me the time to really think about us and think/realize how much I deeply love him and want him in my life.  
 

**Back to the question:** So I love him very very much. But an important and obvious note is that we are not from the same country, obviously. I only have four/fiveish months left here. We have both made it clear we do not want long distance. Something that we really both value a lot is time together. Not having alone time to just even sit with each other every couple of days is hard for us. So if we were to stay together one of us needs to make a move, literally. If I were the older I would've made a choice in a heart beat, but I'm not and I can't sacrifice my schooling. Even if I decided to, he has made it clear that he would never ever want me to sacrifice my schooling for our relationship, he would rather break up with me which would force me to stay in school than stand in the way of that, which I actually really appreciate. So now, I may need to ask him if he would maybe be interested in moving to my country, I guess?  
 

**Logistics**:  
 

So here is some things about us to gauge realisticness  
 

Him 

\-Finished with law school in my country and his   
 

\-Has no job yet and is just searching   
 

\-Fluent in three languages  
 

\-Interested in pursuing other/higher degrees  
 

\-Was/is fond of my country  
 

\-Has citizenship and in country and a degree level where the ability to get a (work permitting) visa in my country to would require 'only' getting a job offer and would cost about $500 and has a very very short processing timeframe.

&amp;#x200B;

Me   
 \-One year of undergrad(International relations)+3/4 years left of law (yes, I wanted to do law before I met him) left in my country   
 

\-Since I was little never felt a desire to live long term in home country/dream of living abroad  
 

\-Fluent in two languages, high level in a third (the langauge of his home country)  
 

Us   
 \-Have common country of duel citizenship between the two of us 

  
 \-Both have similar career path aspirations

  
 \-Both have same goals for family, financial's, travel 

  
 \-Love each other a lot  
 

**SO**. After all of this, lets reastate the questions...Should I/how should I suggest my SO to come live with me in my home country while I finish schooling. Are we too young? Is this relationship normal enough? Is this too quick? Is this what people do? Help help help.  
 

I am afraid of scaring him away, I'm afraid we are too young, I'm afraid that maybe there's red flags I'm missing, I'm afraid cause I've never been in a relationship this deep and sacrificial before, and it's terrifying. If we lived in the same country I would say that we have no plans on breaking up soon and things are going well. But with this deadline approaching, a conversation needs to happen, and soon.

She's told me about her past and how she was abused and scarred from previous relationships and is still a little mentally unstable and depressed. She overthinks a lot and has major trust issues now. Despite knowing all this we still want to try and make things work. I want to be the one to help her heal and make her healthy again so she can move on from her past. Things were going great, but recently, literally right after we finished sexting, she started asking questions about a girl I had sex with in the past and asked if I thought about her. I told her the truth and told her that she crossed my mind while masturbating. I have 0 feelings for the girl in my past and I never did but when I went home over the break my gf was on her period and I guess I was just extremely frustrated I couldn't have sex with her which is no excuse for what I did. She was absolutely devastated and I felt so guilty and disgusted with myself. I texted her and voicemailed her the whole day telling her how sorry I was and that I would do anything to make it up to her. She asked me how I could do that to her knowing her past and knowing how much she trusted me. She said that what I did was repulsive and that she was disgusted with herself for sexting with me. She said she was so close to being healed but now she thinks she's not enough for me and is back to the way she was before or maybe even worse. To make matters worse, this was similar to a situation she was in with her abusive relationship in the past. Even after all this, she told me she forgives me and that we can stay together but I know she still thinks about me and that girl and I don't know how to make it up to her or how to forgive myself for what I did. I feel like I got a second chance that I don't deserve and the guilt of putting salt on her wounds is killing me. I want to go back to the way we were before but the thought of how I hurt her is constantly on my mind. How can I forgive myself for what I did...

\[EDIT\] I was masturbating to my girlfriend and then the girl crossed my mind... not sure if that changes anything but yeah. Shes a really good and sweet girl and she was completely committed to me and I was committed to her which is why she feels so hurt and betrayed.

I hate myself but I looked at my boyfriends Facebook account and I see he’s in contact with old FWBs and exes. It mostly seems like casual platonic catching up. But one of the women keeps asking him to hang out and come to her place to hang out as friends and chat. And he avoids her and says he thinks she has ulterior motives ( I think she does too), but she denies it. She sent him pictures of her in a bikini, and she’s actively trying to meetup with him all the time at her home. The other lady he’s talking to seems to be a friend that he must have slept with based on the info. He says he will hang out if there’s no sex involved. But I can tell he’s still tempted by her. He tells her that he feels conflicted sometimes because of his “hormones” but he also knows from past encounters that even if his partner never found out about the cheating, cheating makes your partner less attractive to you and he doesn’t want that to happen with me. He also says he thinks Im the right person for him. 

I’m happy he hasn’t cheated. And I’m happy he says he wants to stay committed to me. But I’m insecure that he was even talking to these women or entertaining the notion of meeting up with them as if it was going to be platonic when it seems that’s not what they want. Also, I’m troubled by his reason for staying monogamous. Just so that the sex doesn’t decline ?? What about my feelings, what about the guilt? 

I feel insecure and I’m worried that maybe one day he won’t have the restraint to stay faithful. I mean, my body will change, our sex life will fluctuate. I know what I did was wrong. But am I right to feel this way. Should I bring it up with him or just leave it be and trust him? 

Tl;dr my boyfriend speaks to his ex lovers online. Even though he hasn’t cheated I feel so insecure because he mentions in a message that he feels conflicted when he has the urge to sleep with other women and when thinking about his long term happiness in our relationship. What do I do?

My partner and I have been together for almost 12 years. First five years went really well, we're an OK couple together for the most part but our relationship has always been unstable. We've been toxic with each other within the last 6 years ever since I caught him cheating. We fight a lot and call each other names. I yell and scowl at him a lot. I'm an irritable and a mean person. I don't know if my PCOS had something to do with my attitude or I'm probably just an asshole. He's cheated on me multiple times, I caught him sexting women on facebook. I know I know, I should've left while I still can.

Fast forward to 2019. We have a 3 year old child. He works and pays for everything and feeds everyone at home. I'm more than thankful that he let me leave my job to take care of our daughter. He's a hard working person, he hardly sleep since his clients demand his help almost all the damn time. I, on the other hand is jobless, I can't hold a job down not even a home-based one because my daughter is too clingy. I take care of our child on my own but we do have a house maid and they pretty much do everything at home and all I have to do is look after her. It means that I don't serve my partner thinking that the maid can do my job for me. I gotta admit, I became a little lazy especially every after breastfeeding. I thought everything is going well. I'm starting to regret being a stay at home mom because not being able to go outside everyday within the last 3 years is driving me insane. We don't even say hi to each other anymore, we talk right away about stuff at home. No hugging, no touching hands. Every time he's here, I sit at the edge of our bed and watch him go around the room getting ready for the day and getting dressed to leave. We haven't had sex since October last year, it's been a while since we've gone out as a family, I don't socialize with other people since I don't have friends, I hardly go out of the house due to my spondylolisthesis and being an overweight. I hate myself. I am self-deprecating, he once called my an anti social. I have a crippling social anxiety due to my looks and bad skin and he kept insisting that people don't give a shit about how I look and I should change my mindset. I get upset quickly and I cry a lot when my daughter is asleep or napping.

A few days ago he decided that wants to break up with me, I don't want the same. He says that I am not the person that he needs. I don't make him happy anymore. I don't even take care of him, and I feel very ashamed of it. I know my faults and shortcomings but I wasn't expecting that he wants to end everything. I'm aware that our relationship has gone real bad and there's nothing I can do to make him love me again. It also doesn't help that I'm extremely clingy and we have a child together. I've considered moving out but I don't have enough money to feed me and my child. I also don't have any relatives that would help me get back at my feet. I have brothers but I know I can't get help from them, that they have no means to help me. I've no parents, no friends. Can't get women's aid of some sort from where I live because I'm pretty sure it's not available. I'm 100% sure I'd end up on the streets if I decide to leave with my child. I've spent roughly 30% of my life with this person and I don't know what to do if our relationship ends. I'm considering taking my life.

Recently we went on a break because I couldn’t handle the constant arguing and he really needed to grow a little, I couldn’t handle the extra stress while also struggling with school and other issues with friend groups. He agreed to the terms and we both established it would be best for the relationship and separated for a couple weeks. 

When we started talking again after the discussed time period I learned that he followed the girl I had been worrying about our whole relationship on social media. At the very begging out our time together he strongly considered dating this girl but then forgot about her the two years he and I were together. He admitted that the plan was to ask her out during our break but he never worked up the courage. 

I was super hurt by this because we had established there would be no dating during this time but if anything had happened between other people we would work past it together. 

After a long conversation it came out that he thinks she’s hotter than me but he loves me and chooses me. He’s a pretty shy guy so choosing me also seems a lot like settling for me because he doesn’t need to get to know another girl. 

What does this mean for the relationship? Is it even something I should worry about? I’m not the type of person to really notice other guys, is that why this bothers me so much?
 
This guy is one of my first healthy relationships so its new ground for me. Before him there were abusers and cheaters. Overall the relationship wasn’t anything bad. He has mentioned being bored but we live in a town with very little to do and both suffered from minor injuries recently making it hard to go out and do things. I’m just confused where I should go from here or if I should let it go? If it’s nothing to worry about then how do I apologize to him for being crazy?

her: I weirdly thought about you today.

Him: whisky and hugs?

Her: I would but I'm at his

Him: all good keep ya head up.

So the next day I ask her about him and she says ""he's an old friend who hits me up randomly"" 

fast forward to tonight, she's telling me about herself and says ""yeah I used to hit guys up for emotional support whenever my BF wasn't paying attention to me, but I don't do that anymore"" I said was it with one of the guys you cheated with? she said yes. Turns out it was the guy that was texting her that I night I was with her at 2am. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I asked her about the messages and she lies. She doesn't tell me exactly what they say to each other. I asked her one final time to come clean, she gets her phone out reads the messages and she lied again. and I tell her ""you left the part out where he asked for drinks and hugs, also where you said ""I would but I'm at his""

After I dropped her off at home she said “ I lied because of how jealous you get about me and other guys” which is true I do get jealous and I’m currently in therapy and also seeking a psychiatrist for help and coping mechanism for anxiety. I completely understand she was probably scared of my reaction, I never got physical or yelled at her for my jealousy I’d just get sad and shut down and would want my space. Since then though I’ve been making good progress with combating my issues. 

I’m not sure where to go from here with her now.

I currently have 2x4 as the skirting (I think these are too large to look good but I genereally put my legs up when watching movies and 1x4's would be more uncomfortable I think) and then 4x4's for the legs, but I'm wondering if I can get by 2x2s or that too risky?

They are about 5 years old, and had greyed from the elements. I power washed them, sanded them down, and stained them (oil-based stain, we didn't want to paint them, we wanted the natural wood look). So far, so good! 

The last step, i thought, would be to weatherproof them. I tried putting polyurethane on one of them, and it's turned into a hot mess. I'm finding it impossible to apply cleanly without leaving bubbles and large drips, especially at all the little corners, nooks, and crannies. It ends up looking like my chairs are covered in snots, not the look I quite had in mind. It's a bit disheartening, as they were looking so good, and I feel like I'm ruining my own hard work. 

Some photos! https://imgur.com/a/J7T1VE3

So my questions are this:

1) Is there a better way to weather proof them? What should I be using?

2) Or do I just need to be better at applying the polyurethane? Any tips/tricks to this? I'm using small foam brushes, and trying to not over apply. 

3) If I just left them stained, am I going to have to go through the same thing in another few years? Or will just giving them a good wipe down a few times a year add some life? 

I want to build an outdoor storage bench to match next, so I'm hoping to figure out the right solution for these, and take it to the next project. I really had absolutely no idea what I was doing with this project, and was learning as I go. Thanks for any thoughts and guidance. ",DIY,Best way to weatherproof wood patio chairs?

Not wanting the baby to get access to the outlet, I decided to just temporarily remove the outlet (until he's older), cap the wires with wire nuts, and cover the box up with a blank plate.

I disconnected the wires from the outlet and had the following:
Two black wires that were spliced
Two white wires that were separate and loose
A red wire that was loose
Two ground wires that were spliced, and a third ground wire that was loose

After individually capping the loose wires with wire nuts and turning the breaker back on, I discovered the other outlets in his room no longer worked. I determined they must be daisy-chained.

So, I flipped the breaker off, and then twisted the two white wires together and capped them. Now the other outlets work.

However, I'm concerned about the red wire and the ground wire.

Do I need to do anything besides cap the red wire? Does it become ""hot"" when the lightswitch is turned on? Is that a concern if that happens?

We wanted to go with lvp for price and ease of cleaning. Full disclosure I did buy the flooring before I pulled up the carpet so that's my bad. Once I got the carpet up I realized that the floor not only has joins but has about a 1/4 inch lift along the edges of the joins. There are a few waves on the flat areas as well though they are (as far as I can tell) within the tolerance for the flooring though it's hard to tell because of the rise of the joins. 

My plan going forward is to sand down the with an angle grinder and then fill the joins. I haven't done that before but I've see that you should use a backer and epoxy so that's what I will probably go with. Any suggestions on that would be appreciated. After that I am going to put down primer and self leveler before going ahead with the flooring. 

The main question I have is if this is a good plan or should I re-think the whole thing. Thanks in advance!

Hi DIY,

&amp;#x200B;

I purchased this West Elm lift-top coffee table (product page [here](https://www.westelm.com/products/industrial-storage-pop-up-coffee-table-large-h3519/)) secondhand at a deep discount, and at the time didn't think it not closing all the way would bother me as much as it has. A night of Googling has only turned up this Quora question/answer: [https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-repair-a-lift-top-coffee-table-hinge-that-closes-with-a-gap](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-repair-a-lift-top-coffee-table-hinge-that-closes-with-a-gap)

&amp;#x200B;

However, both sides don't close fully, so I don't have a ""good"" and ""bad"" side to compare to. Screws all seem tight. Haven't tried lubricating yet, but I'm off to pick up some WD-40(?) after this post. It seems to me (the top closes fully if pressed down, but then springs back up slightly once you take your hands off) like maybe the coil spring is too tight/there's too much tension in the closed position? I included photos of the mechanism fully-extended and half-closed-- it looks like the spring gets stretched as it closes, and maybe it just can't stretch enough to fully close.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any experience or thoughts about this? Is it possible to adjust those coil springs? Am I way off base regarding the probable cause and a little lube will do it? Kind of lost here.

Thanks!

First time posting. So lately my front door has been having problems closing, it doesn't close all the way without me having to lift it a bit. Because of this I can't properly lock my door either. I know for a fact that it's the top hinge that's affecting the door (seams along the side are widest at the top when the door is closed.) I've looked at some of the hinge screws, but I don't think that's whats causing the issue because they all seemed relatively stable. My guess is the hinge might be crooked or unaligned? causing the door to slack a tiny bit. 

Would I have to buy a new hinge altogether? If so, what would be my best approach for replacing it?

being military myself, I understand that there is a stereotype within the military about deployed service members coming back home and discovering their s/o has been cheating on them. my boyfriend takes this to heart and is constantly worried that I’m going to betray his trust, even though I’ve never done anything to make him question my loyalty. I would never cheat on him; I’ve been cheated on before and I know how awful that feels. aside from that I just don’t have any interest in sex with casual partners. 

the issue is, he gets upset if I so much as hang out with one of my male friends. I decided to grab some lunch with a buddy from high school in my college’s dining hall one day, and he was still upset about it the next day, saying I should have asked him first. if I even mention having any small interaction with a guy (be it friend or classmate or store employee) he becomes passive aggressive with me and accuses me of cheating on him or going behind his back. in his opinion it’s completely normal for him to not want me to have male friends. 
he has also claimed that my guy friends only want to hang out with me because they want to screw me. that part is kind of hurtful. 

my question for you all is, in your opinion, is it okay for a woman to have platonic friendships with men? essentially, would you feel threatened if your s/o had friends of the opposite sex (or whatever gender they have a preference toward)? how can I make him feel more comfortable with the idea of me having friends of the opposite sex? or if I’m in the wrong, should I just not hang out with guys? 

above everything else I want to make sure he’s happy and feels secure in our relationship while he’s deployed as well as when he’s home. 

tl;dr is it normal for my boyfriend to be upset that I have male friends? ",relationships,My (20M) bf doesn’t want me (20F) to have male friends

She is just too busy with her work, and when I come up with some plan for the both of us, she complains and says that I take away her time.
When she is free, she either sleeps or watches a movie. It is as though she is not interested in me anymore.

But I do everything for her, from food to her assignments , everything I can. I take more subjects than her at school and I still have extra time for our relationship. We only go out to malls if she wants something.

We fight almost everyday, and honestly it’s been putting me off. I sometimes doubt this relationship.

Sex is off the table. She just comes up with so many excuses, and when I make the first move to seduce her, she says that I touch her inappropriately and says I don’t respect women. 

When I asked her if she wanted to breakup, she says she loves me and doesn’t wanna breakup.

Help me ? 

TL;DR: Selfish girlfriend, doesn’t wanna breakup , need help.

t2_2fyj7y64,1553776133.0,b6i6du,t3_b6i6du,75,"Some background we've been dating for over a year now and I swear everything is 99.98% perfect. I had to leave the state to go to school I'm (F28) in Ohio and my gf (F34) is back in Virginia. 

My gf has been separated from her husband for a few years but due to complications they didn't get divorced until 2 days ago. They got divorced and had dinner afterwards and joked like old buddies. 

However almost 2 months ago I realized our anniversary was coming up (in a week) and she was still technically married. It never really bothered me but I was starting to get irritated and I haven't gotten updates about it. I called my best friend of 10 years to ask if I was right to ask my gf what was going on and how do I phrase it in a non abrasive way? (I can be too blunt and come off as an ass when I don't mean to). Best friend confirmed and said to basically ask nicely. Well I never got the chance.

See gf was upset that I told her I wouldn't snuggle her cuz she was sick (idw get sick!) And we were arguing about it and I was trying to figure out why it was such a big deal (long distance strains), I was texting my best friend and accidentally sent a text for her to my gf. (It said ""I don't see why she's so hung up on it"") Cue explosions.

GF thinks we're talking shit about her. Calls me a fake and a liar and demands screenshots. I get mad back because as I'm trying to explain I keep getting texts and I get frustrated and blow up. It's officially nuclear.

I said Alotta things I shouldn't have said and I apologized for that. My best friend trying to pacify, texts my gf saying that it's not what she thinks and to not get mad at me. GF is still livid, actually gets madder that best friend talked to her. 

GF insists that I send her screenshots and at first I refuse because I think it's fucking stupid that she's reacting this way, when I finally caved it was 2 days later and I had gotten a new phone, the texts never transfer. She tells me to ask best friend for screen shots I'm not happy about it. Best friend is like is she calling us both liars? Look I'll send it but I'll let you know idk if I can visit in the summer til this all blows over (she's from Chicago) because I know she'll be uncomfortable with me in her house and idw be fake. I say ok, well you can relay that to her later (they've been talking about stuff)

Here's where it gets worse. Best friend retracts my gf's invitation to visit and states she doesn't wanna make her uncomfortable and she doesn't want to come off as fake, that she hopes they can work this out and be friends and that the summer is our time so she won't come and she would back off from our relationship. GF takes that as a slap to the face, how can she claim she wants to help then decline the invite? Best friend must be calling my gf fake and is acting like the bigger person. She replies ""cuz she's doing it for me"" stating that it's not about my best friend, she wants to work on us and asking my friend how can they be friends after she retracted her invitation? She then said to not respond to the message. Best friend said ok and never messaged GF since. She also unfriended her on FB because she took it as ""we can never get passed this"". GF believes that was my best friend telling her to go fuck herself. 

I told both of them I believe they misread each other. My best friend says she can see how she came off as condescending but my GF swears my best friend isn't who I think she is. My GF thinks I'm taking my best friends side and that I refuse to understand her. When really I don't understand why she's holding on for so long and I tell her I'm trying but idt she's hearing me. 

Here's my problem. Every single time I bring up my best friend it's a fight. Every time my best friend tags me in something it's a fight. Anytime my best friend posts anything like a memory or something we talked about it's a fight. My gf swears up and down that my best friend is out to get her that she's vindictive that she is doing this shit to ""flex"" in her face. We've been fighting about this for 2 months I've said we can all talk about it we can fix this, I tell her everything she wants to hear and it's not a lie I want it all too. I ask her what does she want me to do and all I get is ""idk"" but she refuses to talk because she feels she did nothing wrong. She thinks I'm trying to make her fix things when I'm not. I agreed intitally she did nothing wrong. But dragging this out is making it so much worse and I just feel like we should all talk it out clearly and drop it already. 

How come I cant talk about my best friend without a fight but she can have dinner with her drug addict ex husband and tell me just fine without feeling worried about bringing it up to me? But I can't mention my friends without her getting upset about it (I had slept with a guy friend ONCE probably 5 years ago and we're still good friends now but gf gets upset if he's brought up) 

I love her like crazy, but these insecurities are driving me insane and idk what to do... She vehemently refuses couples therapy (bad experience as a kid). But she got some relationship book and admitted that her anxiety is a problem. 

TLDR: my GF and I are long distance and she thinks my best friend is out to sabatoge our relationship. Recently my best friend tagged me in a UFC fight in Chicago in June, inviting me. So my GF thinks she's disrespecting our relationship because my best friend retracted an invitation to her house and said that the summer was our time, but the fight is in the summer.

I'm so fucking lost and idk how to convey it because I've repeated myself so many times now I'm just yelling whenever it's brought up.

I guess I just want any tips on how to convince her that no one is out to get her and I'm trying to fix things. So we're not stuck on this it's been months it shouldn't be going on for this long

I'm flying out to California to see him in about 5 days, and today he suddenly told me that his parents want to eat dinner with us a few days out of the week I'll be there. It makes sense since I'll be staying in their house and I didn't really have any intentions of saying no to begin with, but to say the least, I'm terrified out of my fucking mind.

In addition to having crippling anxiety, I've never really been in a serious enough relationship to where I got to meet my significant other's family, let alone live in their house for a week and share meals together. On top of that, they're hardcore conservative, authoritarian Filipino parents, and although I, too, am Filipino, I wasn't raised with the same traditional upbringing he was. Therefore, I only have a vague idea of what they're like, and I'm extremely scared of accidentally saying something that'll end up in them banning me from their house forever.

His unhealthy diet is killing me, he doesn't have a job and all he does is play video games and smokes weed. Last time we went on a date was a year ago, last time we had sex? I don't even remember. Whenever I confront him about this, he says that I just wanna argue and that he is broke. Then he proceeds to tell how I am lucky to have a an easy job (worked hard for it, ive been poor and homeless before, luck has nothing to do with it) and that I earn a lot of money.

6 months ago, i ended a few year relationship after a tremendous amount of mental and more recently physical abuse but after a couple weeks i started dating this kid I've known for 15 years but have been out of contact for 6 years. I always had such strong feelings for the kid i recently met back up with. He moved away 6 years ago and back then he was one of my best friends. So we met back up and fell completely head over heels in love with each other. I'm talking like looking back on it I've loved this kid before even really knowing i was in love.

I've never been truly in love with my ex. It turned into something that was just comfortable and familiar. 

My cousin (22F) never agreed with my decision to start a new relationship so soon. We got into a really bad argument and haven't talked for 6 months, practically since this new relationship started. And even though we've recently started talking again, it still somehow reverted back to the original argument causing her once again to cut me off and ignore me. 

i believe if somebody is truly your friend, no matter how you decide to live your life, unless you're harming yourself or somebody else, should always support everything you do whether they agree or not. 

My cousin on the other hand thinks the complete opposite. If somebody is really your friend they're going to tell you when they think you're wrong and not support your decision to the extent of even cutting you off completely regardless if it affects them directly or not. 

I've been honest with her about going thru the mental and pyschical abuse in the past and has NEVER once felt he wad in the wrong.

So because I actually enjoy hearing people's opinions, and if I'm wrong i can correct myself, what does everybody else think? Or just any general opinion at all would great

The next day, the weird things started happening, in the morning, a mutual friend(F17) of ours, told me she needs some distance and time, that made me confused, as we weren't in relationship or anything. It still made me feel really bad, because ever since we met we've been really close to each other. 





Our friend also told me that she already knew that i had feelings for her,i thought maybe that's why she's acting so weird. But the things got even stranger. I didn't text or talk to her for a day, she calls me and acts as if nothing happened. It was the the day i went back to university in another city.

In the next few days she's been texting me sometimes, my friend told me today she's been going out with that guy, but has been acting really weird, angry and unusual. He told me she still feels bad for the things between us being  strained, she was afraid of calling me because she thinks after that we won't talk to each other anymore.

t2_zjmsv,1553746907.0,b6ecbt,t3_b6ecbt,2,"First things first: we met on tinder. 

After talking for like a day, he shows up at my work (I’m a server)! I got off right after he left, and he was still in the parking lot so we just hung out and talked for a while. 

We went in a couple dates, movies and dinner and that stuff when he made a move. I told him I wasn’t comfortable yet, I had some bad experiences in the past and wanted to take things slow. He was so kind and understanding and didn’t pressure me to ask what happened. I also asked if he’s just looking for a FWB or a relationship, and he told me he wants a relationship but doesn’t want to jump into it too soon. I agreed that’s what I wanted. We were just starting a casual dating thing after a little because we aren’t worried about a relationship; if it happens it happens, if it doesn’t that’s ok too. 

It’s been a few months, we started talking in December. We’ve been seeing each other still and talking at least once a day saying good morning or snap chatting occasionally throughout the day. We’re both adults, I’m not worried about what he’s doing or with whom. At least I thought, until I realized I started to like him. 

I was having pretty bad anxiety on a date night a few weeks ago, and wanted to cancel but he promised he would make me feel better. We met at the movies, and went in and sat down at the back. We were holding hands, and then the rollercoaster scene comes on before the movie starts and he puts his arm around me and starts making the chchchchch sounds and putting his other hand up and moving us from side to side like a real ride. I started giggling and had the biggest smile. 

During the movie at random times he would just kiss my forehead, or kiss the back of my hand a bunch when he was holding it. He fell asleep because he had a long day at work and he had already seen the movie, and I just played with his hair. After the movie we just talked for a little and I went home feeling a little better. I realized “oh fuck”... I was starting to fall for him. 

A different day, he drove an hour with his grandmas car because his was broke, just to see me after class and give me a hug... I about cried when I saw him and he hugged me. He literally just wanted to see me, even after I had gone a few weeks without seeing him due to school, work, anxiety and stress and he was so amazing during all of it. 

I realized after talking about that with my friend that I really am starting to like him. I’ve met his sister and his parents when I went over to his house the first time, and I’m nervous to tell him. I know I need to, I think he feels the same way but at the same time I don’t know how to approach him. This is the first real “adult” relationship I’ve had, where we take things slow and not just get into a relationship after a couple of dates. 

We have been intimate, and the sex is amazing and we have great sexual chemistry which is a big thing for me. 

My question is this: should I wait to see if he initiates anything, or should I just go ahead and tell him I need to talk to him and let him know I’m starting to catch feelings and we should have an adult discussion? Any tips or hints or helpful sayings will be appreciated. 

Also, he kept saying he wanted to move out of his parents house before getting into a relationship when we first started our dating... he is getting the keys for his house April 26th, and he wants me to be one of the first few he gives a tour to.

t2_29q6dvxu,1553715324.0,b68my6,t3_b68my6,8,"TL;DR IN THE BOTTOM

Okay.. So I have been dating(ex-bf now) this guy for almost 2 years, he is 19 and I am 18 and now we are in our first year of University. We both have almost the same classes and spend our time together. Well the problem here is that I don't know if I'm right for him. Whenever we talk it somehow gets into an argument. He tells me that I never understand what he's saying and when I do tell him to make me understand he never does and expects me to know everything which results to him getting mad. Also, whenever he tells me his feelings, I acknowledge them but at the same time when I try to express myself to him he tells me that I always talk about myself and that I'm not noticing his feelings which in fact I do, but he believes otherwise. Another thing is that he always tells me I'm lying about things when I'm not. 

One time during the summer when we were on a break another guy dm'ed me but we only talked normally for a day and then I blocked him after because even tho me and my bf were just on a break, i still didn't want to disrespect him. When we got back together later, he told me that what I did was cheating and that I had broken all his trust. Ever since then our relationship has always been rocky. During our break he talked to another girl as well but whenever I bring it up he always dismisses it. 

He always tells me that I have lie to him but he never tells me what I did wrong. I admit, I have lied to him about a few things but I have always told him about it later and none of these lies are harmful, it was just that I broke a promise about hanging out or that I did something stupid like making an account on instagram 2 years before I met him and talked to myself on it (lol im not going to go into detail about this, because this is such a stupid thing).  He tells me that I have to gain his trust because he feels like I broke it when the guy DM’d  me. And I don’t talk to any guys at all and he knows that. I have 0 straight guy friends but he has many friends who are girls and that’s okay.

Also, he always gets jealous when I follow guys on instagram but they are guys that I know but when he does the same its okay all of a sudden. Also, during our relationship when other girls DM’d him and replied back, he never branded that as cheating. He said it was a mistake and moved on but when I did the same, he tells me that what I did was cheat on him. 

Also, he has talked to my mom on the phone one time and disrespected her, which my mom obviously got mad at and didn't approve of our relationship but I still wanted to be with him anyways because I liked him.  Another thing is that he gets mad over the littlest things, whenever I don't look nice or I just look like a hobo lol, he tells me to dress better or look better because he wants his friends and family to have a good impression on me all the time. Like when we are at university, he tells me to always put my hair back because I look better like that and because if his friends see me I will look good in front of them.

I told him that I wanted a break because I couldn’t deal with the emotional stress and that I wanted to better myself first before I can get back into the relationship. I told him that it’s free for him to move on since it wouldn’t be fair if he waits for me. I told him that I still care for him and want to be with him in the future but at this point on I am unable to. He then tells me that I was fake and never truly loved him and wasted 2 years of our lives because of the way I feel. He said that If I truly loved him, we would’ve been together and we could’ve gotten over it together but I don’t agree with that since we’ve tried doing that before and it hadn’t worked. Which is why I thought me being alone for a while would be better instead. So, I had told him we can be friends until I get back to normal and if he doesn’t want that he can move on. To which he didn’t give me a proper reply

Until yesterday. Yesterday, he posted a picture on Instagram with the caption “follow me on this wedding website- my username being John(for example)”. He posted this on his public account with almost 4000 people and not his private account. 
Obviously there were many girls who had commenting back and he even replied to all of them. One of his comments to the girls were “only if you teach me how to smile”. And I thought that what he did was really disrespectful so I blocked him on that account. He then texted me saying that what he posted was a JOKE and he didn’t know SO many girls would comment. He thought only his friend would. He said that he did this to get my attention. And that he has nothing to hide, since it wasn’t a dm but a public post where I could see it all.

I don’t know if I’m crazy or not but he tells me that he loves me and wants to be with me after he did this. I can’t believe it. He said that he gave up all his friends for me and that he has no one to talk to about this because he lost me as his best friend. I never told him to give up his friends for me, I always encouraged him to hang out with them. 

When we were on the phone yesterday, he told me that he will make me regret my choice of not being with him and that he would smear his success in my face in the future. But later on he texted me saying that he was only hurt, which is why he said those things. Which he does a lot, when he’s mad he says the craziest things but always apologizes for it afterwards.

EDIT: he also said that I’m not ready mentally because that’s what I believe and that no one says this type of stuff when their in a middle of a relationship. He’s telling me that how I feel is an excuse and that I just played him.


(TL;DR): I really am unable to understand anything that’s happening to me rn.

I’ve always been sort of a tomboy all throughout my life. Perhaps the main reason why it was easy for me to befriend her was because she is the same way. Anyways, we both moved from another state and are currently in long-term relationships. Over time I have found that my best friend’s favorite thing to discuss is her relationship problems. My boyfriend is fairly acquainted with my best friend’s boyfriend before any of us ever dated each other. My boyfriend understands that not too many people, including himself, do not really like him. The guy is pretty narcissistic, selfish, and always shines a negative light in situations most people don’t have any issues with. 

At this point, from what my best friend has told me, her relationship with her boyfriend has already gotten toxic. Now it truly is a wonder for me and to everyone who knows her, why the hell is she still with this guy? It’s like she is diseased with the hope that she can change him and she can finally get this guy to finally treat her how she wants to be treated. One night we were drunk and I truly expressed how I felt about her relationship as she was ranting about it, in a “fed up” type of way. every time she said something he did to her, I said “break up with him”....“break up with him then.”. After that, her complaints reduced about 85%. 

PROBLEM: For the past couple months, I have been planning a road trip out of state with my best friend, boyfriend, and male friend (whom my boyfriend, best friend and I are very close with). My best friend initially did not want her boyfriend at all involved in this trip because he always would go on trips with his friends without her. Last night we were with our boyfriends at a social function and she asks me if her boyfriend can come on the road trip with us, with her boyfriend right next to her!! I honestly do not want this guy to go...thanks to my best friend, I do not respect him at all. I told her there won’t be enough room in my car, which was true...then she answers, “we can take my car!”. then moments later I tell her privately the friend’s place we will be staying at won’t have extra room for a 5th person. Then she responds, “well we can just get our own place....I just feel bad because I never even take more than 5 days off to go on a vacation with him”. I thought in my head....how is that my fucking problem?!

This guy will seriously ruin the trip and now I regret inviting her even though she is my best friend. I don’t know what to do and I really don’t want to lose this friendship. What should I do?

At the time, boyfriend said that he had the vasectomy because his wife told him she was using contraception and got pregnant with a third child and he didn’t want that to happen again. He said everything was ‘on the table’  his past decisions didn’t have to impact my life. We’ll cross that bridge but I’m open.

Fast forward 2 years. Boyfriend now says he doesn’t want any more kids or to get married and can’t guarantee that he will but might feel  differently in the future. His demeanour suggests that he definitely doesn’t want to but doesn’t want to say it outright as it will push me away and, honestly, it does make me angry that his stance has changed. I would never want to push someone into a marriage or children so I feel like I have a decision to make. Like it, or lump it. He wants us to buy a house together near his children and I don’t want to take that step without seriously considering what the future looks like for me and whether or not I will be happy.

I’ve always imagined that I would have kids one day but I haven’t experienced the overwhelming maternal pull that my friends seemed to have gone through. I’ve focussed on my career and got myself into a really good position but I’m not sure I’m going to be happy if I don’t have the opportunity to have a family. The way I have expressed this to him is that I know I wouldn’t regret having children but I think I will regret not having them. 

I appreciate the positive side of not having children. I’m free to do what I want to do, can travel, focus on my career and generally have a good lifestyle but, with my boyfriend having children, I do feel like I can’t enjoy that to the fullest because he has limitations. An example would be that I’ve always wanted to live in a different country - I could do that as I don’t have children but can’t do that because he does. I feel like I am making compromises and sacrifices for him and his children but he is not considering what I want out of life.

What do you think Reddit? I’ve been told this is one that I have to decide on for myself but there must be people out there who have been through this. I would very much appreciate any advice from the other side.

I have my own home with her brother, and all three of our bedrooms and our only bathroom is upstairs. The only reason anyone has to be upstairs is to go to the toilet, or possibly to my daughter's room if their kid is playing there too. 

I've noticed whenever my SIL comes over, she just walks on through to our room, which I kinda feel like is an invasion of privacy. All the clean laundry comes to our room, and if we have visitors we tuck away a few things in our room so it's invariably the messiest room in the house and the one we least want people in. But no matter what she's always in there, and seemingly for no reason at all. It's usually to 'see my paint colour' (it hasn't been painted in over a year) or 'see the cat' or 'look out the front window'.

The worst was today - I came home from work early as I'm feeling ill. I knew she was coming over with her kids and my partner kindly said I could stay in bed and not worry about coming down to be sociable etc, especially with the kids over it's a lot when you have a headache. He said he just wasn't gonna mention I was home at all because the kids would come try and chat and play if they knew I was here.

So I'm listening to them play in the next room and SIL comes up to check on them and sees they are all fine. THEN SHE OPENS MY BEDROOM DOOR. I've stuck my head under the covers and she hovers then closes it again. Wtf?? Why is she always opening my bedroom door like what is she expecting to see? 

I just feel like because we're all adults it's an unspoken boundary, you don't just hit up someone's bedroom without having an invite to come see or a legit reason. 

Am I weird for thinking this is irritating and not being able to make any sense out of it? Also I know that everyone is going to suggest I just talk to her about it but how awkward is that? 'Yo I know you're in you're 30s now but please stay out of my room?'. I have tried in the past to hint that I hate having folk in there because that's where all my laundry goes for ironing and all the spare toys get stored to create extra play room.

We've been doing long distance for the past 8 months, and it hasn't been that bad. Yes, we both miss each other and we have only been able to see each other twice (every 3-4 months) but we've been making the most out of it.

I love him and I see a whole future with him (which is a new thing for me) but is this realistic? We don't have an end goal. One of us will have to sacrifice our career and/or family to move for the other. 

Since his job offer, I have really been thinking about breaking up... I don't want to do it (and I know that he doesn't either) but it seems like our only option at this point. Do we end it?!

       So my bf(20m) and I (21f) have been together roughly  9 months and we are trying to work through a lot of issues and I'm utterly stumped.

    Well the last few weeks I haven't exactly been the sweetest gf in the world. I mean I've been telling him over and over that I'd like him to help me more with house work and budgeting but all I get is a head nod and ""I'll try better."" Well I haven't gotten off his case and I've border line begged and nagged at him. Also we haven't been having sex like we used to. We're trying to work though all this and its to the point our relationship almost came to an end. 
    He finally sat me down and explained how he's tired of me b*tching at him when he does anything that makes him happy. For example he recently put new speakers and subs in his car because he loves bass and all I asked was that he not make the car rattle when I'm in it. Well a week ago I said he was being inconsiderate because I could hear his radio from our second story apartment,and he was 3 blocks away. I'd like to add that he comes home at 7am in the morning 5 days a week. But he says ""The bass helps me calm down and feel better after work."" Well we already have issues with our downstairs neighbors, and I'd like to not make it worse.
    Any way while he was telling me he was tired of me nagging he went on about how many times he's tried to compromise me and the only examples I got from him was the speaker, and how he doesn't go out to see his parents anymore because he doesn't want me to feel bad about my relationship with my own parents,and he knows I'm not keen on going out there every weekend. Which I said that he can visit his parents anytime and that I wouldn't tell him no and he said ""But I don't want to go without you."" So I don't stop him he's the one who has told me for 9 months that his mom's strictness makes him not want to visit.
    Ugh I'm just frustrated with it all. Like yeah I'm tired of nagging, but I feel like he's trying to make me feel guilty for me wanting him to stop acting like a child.  Like I can go on and on about he gets defensive if I call out his crappy partnership.

TLDR: Boyfriend says I nag at him too much and wants me to be a little nicer, claims I nag at everything that makes him happy. I'm just tired of coddling his feelings. I feel more like his mom than a partner.

I also do love her and treasure her as my second mom.

But somehow I can't help but think that living in the same roof would be a problem in the future because I feel like if I would get married, I would want to be the master of the household. For example I want to change the color of the house, I want to be able to change it the way I like it, without anyone telling me what to do. I want to be able to leave the dishes if I feel tired and not feel guilty about it. I want to be able to raise my kids with my husband and I's ways only. I want to be able to do household chores whenever I want to and not just because I'm pressured that my mother in law would be disappointed on how I run the household. I want to be the one who will serve my husband and my kids and do it my way.

I know that my boyfriend and his mother's relationship is very tight. He loves her so much. He gets crazy when she's sick, he follows what she says, he will never leave her (she's a single parent) and to my boyfriend's eyes she is the only person that has never done him wrong and loves him unconditionally, he always brags about how his mother is the best in the world and that she's very good in taking care of him. in short she is literally his bestfriend and vice versa. I understand that because I am like that to my mom as well, but I can leave her when I get married because she has my dad. My bf's mom doesn't have anyone who can look after her.

Now he's been asking me and giving me clues that he wants to settle down already, but it is clear that we 3 will live in the same house. I kinda feel okay about it but I'm torn, because really my idea of marriage is starting with just the two of you in the house and eventually having kids but not this setup of having a parent in the house. What should I do? I love my boyfriend but there's a gutfeel in me that something bad will happen if the 3 of us will live in the same house because I can see that they are overprotective of each other which could lead to trouble and I don't want to be the third wheel in my own marriage?

With that being said, I’m also adapting to the idea that she is her own separate person and the world wouldn’t end if we broke up. 

Anyway, the issue is her sorority social events. Specifically the fact that she has a mixer every Friday and then she doesn’t want to go to any other parties. It’s annoying to not be able to go to parties with her because she’s not a party girl. She said Ive made her guilty in the past because I tell her how I have nothing to do while she’s gone and I just sit in silence and wait for her to be done, that I miss her etc. You need girls to get into parties here, and it feels weird for me going with a group of girls while I have a girlfriend. Then I see all her sisters at these parties and I feel like I’m being watched. Im never drunk with my girlfriend, and I guess I’m left wondering what it is that she does at these mixers.

My dad is a serial cheater and compulsive liar. It’s normally something that’s known but we don’t talk about. Unfortunately, my dad decided to be much more open about his adultery while I was visiting him with my boyfriend a couple days ago. He began telling us a story of how my stepmom (43f) caught him redhanded while he was supposed to be working. He also told us about times that he’s slipped up with text conversations/phone calls. He kept going on about not being a good cheater and how needed to stop. He said he goes weeks where he does “good”, then there’s a slip in the routine. It was embarrassing and uncomfortable to sit through.

My dad and stepmom have been together for about 10ish years. I can’t help but think of the emotional abuse this woman endured. nevermind the physical and mental abuse she endured during her pervious marriage.  I think back to my mom, everything he put through when I was younger. My parents split when I was 9 for the same reasons. I can’t help but have some sort of resentment towards my dad for being a huge part in why my mom self esteem plummeted so bad she’s continuing a relationship with my abuser (story for another time) 

I’ve asked my dad why not leave? He’s all about being frugal and saving money, he could even look at it as a financial gain. They have no children together, everything they have he’s paid for. i’m honestly surprised i’m my dads only child. He’s even known around our hometown. 

I want to sit him down and try to at least reason with him a little bit. I feel wrong, like I’m condoning the behavior. I need him to recognize the emotional trauma he’s inflicted on the women in his life. I need him to recognize that he has a problem and do something about it. I love my dad, he’s been great and stepped up when my mom completely failed me but I just... i’m conflicted and hurt. i’m not sure what to do or is there anything i can do?

She had this doubt at the beginning about starting another relationship since she hasn't been single in a long time and feels like she has to learn how to be on her own. We talked about this at the beginning, decided to try to work through them while on the relationship, but she says that she felt a bit of resentment building up because she wasn't doing what she decided she was gonna do on this exchange program, and I could feel it troubling her so I suggesting breaking up, I just want some help figuring out what to do from now.

She says she cant tell how long it will take and can't say either way that she would or wouldn't wanna go back together, but would if she felt well. She would say how she felt so happy and well when she was with me, but would get sad and depressed sometimes when alone, which is why she thought she had to learn to be on her own. We are still on messaging terms as friends, but agreed to give it some time before we see each other.

On one hand I want to ""wait for her"" in a sense, give it some time (and take some time for myself too, I also haven't been single for long going on year now) and then talk about it and check in with each other in a couple months, see how we both feel then. Another part of me feels like I should just write it of as a lost relationship and move on, but I did see a future with this girl and I feel like I would be risking that possibility by not giving it a chance at least.

I wasn't totally phased by him, but rumours started that he was attracted to me. We started talking, and I dodged him for pretty much 7 months until I finally agreed to date him. 

This was my second relationship, and I was known to be someone quite picky. My first relationship lasted almost 2 years, (yes, even though I was young) and that ended badly. So it was really hard for me to move on considering he was also kind of my bestfriend. So me accepting this second guy in my life was a big deal. Bear in mind my country is quite conservative so dating among is common but not too common, yaknow? There's no touching or kissing invovled or any of the sort lol. 


Anyway, it was pretty nice at the start, we went out and it was one of the best days I had in a while. I actually have depression, (taking meds for it) so having someone who could make me feel at ease is really something.


Long story short, we broke up around November. He broke up with me. We both had issues, but he was really harsh with it. Even his friends were mad at him for dumping me the way he did. It's also because everyone knew I don't say yes easily. And wow, was I heartbroken. Everyone kinda knew how miserable I was, but my close friends knew how sad I was every single day. We were even smack in the middle of exams at the time.


This year, my close friend started to date him in around Last February. The thing is, when we broke up, she was one of the people who comforted me. We go to a boarding school, and she was my roommate last year. So she witnessed me getting together with this guy, perhaps some fights, the gifts he got me, she would know. And she was there when we broke up too. She always said me and him were cute together, and got excited when she saw photos of us. When we broke up, she told me he was trash, and he didnt deserve me. And she said he'll make him get what he deserved. At this time she was dating a guy who she had been with longer than me and this dude, but they broke up due to family problems in around January. She really liked this guy. Love even.


But now they're dating.
I feel really messed up. She's my classmate this year, and I used to sit behind her. Since this incident, I switched placed and we don't talk. The ended friendship hurts more. But in general, both of this just hurts. Both of them actually have been known to be somewhat of players, but I guess it's cause I trusted them which is why it hurts so much.

Graduated college this past May, which also saw me breaking up with my long-term girlfriend. I've since moved to a new city and met someone I think is terrific. We vaguely knew one another in school but weren't close, and reconnected over a dating app a few months ago. We've been hanging out at restaurants and coffee shops fairly regularly and I always have a wonderful time with her, but I'm honestly not sure if she's interested or just sees me as a friend. I don't know what I should do in this situation; I feel like it's healthy to just be patient and see if something develops, but I'm worried that if I don't communicate how I feel, I'll miss my chance. Conversely, if I do and she's not interested, I could loose a cool new friend while I'm still trying to establish myself in a new city.

The basic dimensions are 12'x24'.  One side would be attached with a ledger board to an existing raised deck.   The other side would be supported b 3 6""x6"" posts which would use something like a Simpson Strong Tie.   I was thinking of covering the roof with 1x6s.   We want the area to be fully shaded.  The roof would not normally support people, but I'd want to be able to up there for maintenance when necessary.  All wood would be pressure treated lumber.

I'd have the 2x10 beam across the post sit in notches cut out of the posts, and then bolted to it.  The joists would attach to the ledger and beams using joist hangers.  I'd have a slight slope on the roof letting rain/snow drain away from the house.  I was thinking 1:12 (dropping one foot).

So my main questions are:

Are 2x10s enough?   I've looked at tables from -multiple sources and I'm not sure if that's enough.

Are 24"" centres okay, or do I need to go to 16""?

The house we bought has these ridiculous light fixtures. After pulling one out of the ceiling and disconnecting the bulb I have what is shown here.

I cannot for the life of me work out how to get this thing open. The bulb itself twists freely but is completely blocked from exiting by the central metal piece. The silver covering on the front looks like it could be twisted or pried off but attempts to do so have broken screwdrivers and other various metal objects

Drawing inspiration from this post: https://www.ikeahackers.net/2019/02/ikea-corner-table-diy.html

I will be joining a 68"" butcher block with a 50"" butcher block. I plan on using these [legs](https://www.hairpinlegs.com/collections/table-legs/products/2x2-h-tube-leg) on the ends. My question is, if i use a 3rd leg of that style and put it where the tabletops meet, will that be efficient support?

So, I have a metal Dance Dance Revolution pad that I'm trying to attach a bar to. When you play with a bar you lean your bodyweight on it to help maneuver your legs easier. [Here's an example of what I mean.](https://i.imgur.com/tUOEnqD.jpg) I have a metal frame (the grey part in the pic) that the pad (the green) sits in and attaches to, and the bar is welded to the back of the frame.

My issue is that certain movements cause the front of the pad/frame to lift up and the whole thing falls backwards (red arrow). I'm guessing I need to construct something reminiscent of a wheelie bar to prevent this. I have a lot of boards of various sizes laying around so I'll likely use those instead of metal. I was thinking of attaching a couple of boards to the sides of the frame but I'm unsure of how far back they would need to extend or if I should position them a certain way or if they need to be a certain weight, etc etc. How would I go about figuring all that out? Or, conversely, is there a better or more intuitive way of solving my problem that I've overlooked?

The advantages - less exterior work, better(?) exterior appearance, much better sound damping (there is a busy 4-lane road about 150' beyond the doors to the right).  The big downside is that I've never seen this done before, which I typically take to mean my idea is stupid.

Next,  I applied a coat of stain that went on smoothly, so I'm good there (water based stain). It's the polycrylic that's killing me. I'm using Minwax's water based polycrylic clear gloss using a foam brush (not a roller). I've waited, at a minimum 2 hours; with room temps in 60s to 70s F. I'm not sure there's a benefit to explaining my process since I'm here asking for help. My problems with the poly have been:

* finding the balance of ""the right level"" of application. If dry spots appear during application, should I go back and reapply? I usually see this on the first coat. I've read mostly to go thin, but I've also read going heavier is find since you'll be sanding it down between coats.
* Minwax states to sand using 220 between multiple coats: agree/disagree?
* is 2 hours long enough to cure based on the temps I currently have? I really want to get that glass finish. at times I've waited over 4 hours before sanding down and applying the next coat
* cloudy finish when trying to get that glass shine. I've read the cloudiness could be not waiting long enough for the poly to cure
* should i use an orbital sander or not? I have sand paper for it. I'm thinking no since I'm new to this. It does have speed settings though...
* lighting. I'm working in the garage, but I try to get natural light by opening the garage door. This helps showing dry spots on those initial coats. But if I want to work on this at night, it's a problem with the overhead LED lights. They just don't show it as well.

His family knows about his issues and also try to help him but to no avail. I don't want to give up on him because I really do love him but I don't know what else to do or how to help him.

Meanwhile, they went out of their way to throw one of the other girls in our group a bday party last month. There has also been a few times that they hang out without inviting me which always feels like shit. It seems like they are all closer with each other and somehow I got pushed away. I don’t know what I did to deserve it. The only thing I can think of is that I don’t care for alcohol so I don’t drink and get as crazy as they do. Maybe they don’t think I’m fun?

I've been seeing a great guy. Very sweet, we have a lot in common, great companionship, conversation, awesome sex, awesome everything. Almost. We don't live together but we spend weekends together as often as we can, usually 2-3 times a month. Text every day, video chats most evenings. We exchange ""I love yous"". I say almost awesome everything because there's a couple issues and on my last visit I saw something very suspicious that really bothers me. The couple issues: I stay at his place always, I am caring for and living with my handicapped sister and male company here isn't an option. I'm super uncomfortable at his apartment. It's a studio, completely open plan and he has a big, ill behaved dog that makes sleeping or relaxing there very difficult. There's a workaround for that, she can stay on the balcony for a little while so I can have dog-free time (I'm a cat person) and she can have fresh air. So that's not a super big deal, buuuut...his place is really dirty. Smells like doggy B.O. He does very little cleaning. He keeps the trash picked up and taken out but that's pretty much it. Dirty floors, bathroom, his dog has accidents sometimes and he leaves poop laying around, stuff like that. I've had to remind him several times to do things like pick up the poop, wash his smelly sheets (dog sleeps with him if I'm not there) if he wants me to sleep there or do the dishes if he wants me to cook something for him. We've had conversations about this, I've told him I would *help*  him clean but I won't do it for him. But nothing has gotten better. So, in spite of the great time I have with him it's pretty uncomfortable at a nasty bachelor pad. Now he's talking about having his younger brother stay at his place with him. Huh? In a one room studio? And we will have private sexy time where? I'll tell him to go out while we do that, he says. Ummm...yeah. I wonder how many times that will happen before they start fighting about it. Before bro or even bf resents me for it. So I'm not liking this development at all. He's mentioned living together a few times but that's never going to happen in his dirty studio apartment with the dog and bro there. So those are the issues. 

Now the suspicious thing. On my last visit there I found a bottle of lube that he's never used with me on his nightstand. It's open and had some of it used. It's Max Head lube. For oral. I checked it out, sniffed it, noted how high is the level of liquid in the bottle. It's a flavored, sticky lube that's not suitable for wanking at all, so that's not why he had it out on his nightstand. It's possible he might have gotten it out to use the last time I was there but forgot about it but when I go back again I'm checking how much is in there. If there's more gone, I will ask him about it. I don't like this, I've been cheated on before so I'm really bothered now. 

I'm wondering about the viability of this new relationship or am I being nitpicky? What say you, Reddit?

t2_qa56n,1553761249.0,b6g6jl,t3_b6g6jl,14,"We met at work about a year ago and became good friends because we take the the same transportation to go to and from work and live very close to each other. We usually hang out on the weekends and talk to each other about everything. 


Due to a few changes in the transportation system, a few weeks ago we had agreed that in order to save money during this week he would take the car to the city and we would split the costs. This sounded great. 

This is the part where I find relevant to mention that I suffer from anxiety.

On Tuesday night while we were texting, I asked him at what time should I be ready for work the following day. He stopped replying. An hour later, my anxiety started flaring up. It was 10pm and I still didn’t know at what time I had to get up and be ready. So I texted him again a reminder to tell me the pick up time on Wednesday, since I know he sometimes he forgets to reply to texts. Still no reply. I wanted to go to sleep but I still didn’t have a reply. I didn’t call him because last time I called him at night he seemed annoyed. So I texted him once again at 11:30. Nothing. And then I found he was posting things on Instagram so he was on his phone. 

At midnight he finally texted “can’t take you to work tomorrow. Sorry. Talk later”

I was hurt and upset that he couldn’t text that to me earlier when he knows I have anxiety and how much I care about plans and timings. 

The following day I told him he owed me an explanation. He ended up confessing he hooked up with a mutual friend (not from work) and offered her a ride the next day - she usually takes her own car to the city. 

This made me even more upset. At midnight he decided the plans he made with me weeks before didn’t matter after all because he got laid. It’s not like she needed the ride either, unlike me. I told him as much and he said I was being ridiculous. “Life happens and plans change” 

He doesn’t even acknowledge that what he did was wrong. I was counting on him. I had to pay to ride the train and the subway because my monthly subscription expired last week. 

I realized it was no use arguing anymore because he wasn’t open to consider my point of view, so I asked him “what about tomorrow, do I have a ride ?”  And he said “no, sorry”

I’m so hurt because to me a friend is someone I can count on and he doesn’t even realize that he’s letting me down. He’s not even willing to accept that my reasons to be disappointed are valid. This is not the first time he has let me down when I’m counting on him. 

Am I being as ridiculous as he says? Is it really fine to just cancel plans last minute when your friend is counting on you?

Tl;dr: arranged plans weeks ago to ride to work this week with a friend/coworker to save money. After I asked him multiple times on Tuesday what time we were leaving, at midnight he texted he couldn’t give me a ride because of a hookup. I’m hurt and upset plans don’t mean anything to him.

Whenever I ask her if we can do something, she always hesitates before saying so. If she says yeah, ok cool. When she says no there’s an excuse. For example, last week I asked if she wanted to go out over the weekend. She said she’s doing something with her mom on Saturday. I ask what. She says she doesn’t know. The weekend passes and I lightly bring up her plans with her mom. And of course she didn’t do anything. We text less than before too. At the beginning she was always texting me. I still don’t think I ever take more than 20 minutes to respond. For her sometimes it takes hours to respond. It’s disheartening because it wasn’t like that before. When we do talk in person it’s all fine, but that’s only one part of the relationship. Also a few months back she would invite me over every time her parents weren’t home. I did the same but my house is more busy so there weren’t that many opportunities. After a few times she said she was thinking about sex. I said I’m open to it, and she said the same. That was in January. She hasn’t invited me over since. In the beginning we would also hang out a lot more after school. Now she wants to go home as soon as possible. I really hope I’m being paranoid here. To be honest this is all new to me. I hope someone more experienced can point me in the right direction.

I’m a 30y/o female and I’ve had some pretty messed up relationships in the past - including 1 emotionally/physically abusive one and a couple where I’ve been cheated on. Early last year I got to a point again where I felt ready to have one - and fell pretty deep into a thing with a guy (26) who lived in another country (we met when he was visiting my city), promised me the world then ghosted me after about 4 months... only to reappear, have me come to visit, sleep with me and tell me he actually has a girlfriend now. 

I promised myself I wouldn’t get into a situation like that again but cut forward a few months to October and I meet ANOTHER guy (26) whilst on holiday again. This guy did no promising of the world, but he came and visited me THREE times across continents, and I went to visit him at Christmas, and all in all we’ve been having a great time. He lives in Europe and I live in Brazil but am from the UK. This summer I’m moving back to Europe, 3 hours drive from where he is. We decided back in January to give things a proper go and from February - March he came and stayed with me in Brazil for a month. However, now we are unable to see each other for three and a half.

And I’m driving myself (and probably him) a bit insane! 
I feel really paranoid he’s going to ghost me, he’s going to meet someone else, he’s going to disappear... all sorts of things based on little to no evidence. I feel like I’m watching his every move expecting him to behave like others have in the past but it’s based on NOTHING he has done. He has only been lovely to me - he has shown me multiple times he cares and although he is not very vocal about his feelings, his actions speak loudly. 

So why am I being like this?! And most importantly, how can I stop it? I’m scared I’m sabotaging things just by getting irritable over nothing or if he doesn’t say exactly what I want him to say. I notice how long he takes to reply to messages and feel myself on edge if he takes what I perceive to be ‘too long’. If he’s less talkative one day I immediately spiral into worry. I have contemplated even just stopping talking to him because I’m so on edge! I’m being super unfair and imposing other’s behaviours onto his. What can I do to stop checking his last online because I’m sure, soon, he’s going to ignore me, and constantly guessing who else he’s talking to, making stupid jokes about a secret girlfriend etc.

I’m really looking for PRACTICAL solutions here - actual techniques people have used to get their relationship mindset into a more healthy place.

Basically, I have an aversion to people and 'people' people. When I got together with my girlfriend, I thought she wasn't a people person but I recently found out she has a lot of friends and she's a 'people' person. 

I felt more on edge around her but I ignored it until I met her friends and it became more real. Her friends are actually nice and apparently like me but the feeling of dread has multiplied many times over. I still want her to be with my girlfriend, but I couldn't get over my issue. 

So I ignored her friends and avoided hanging out with her when they are around. Well, today I had to hang out with her and her friends and she snapped and yelled at me. I felt nothing at first but something set off in me, I stopped talking and turned cold and finally, I went despondent. 

My girlfriend tried to apologize, and I wanted to feel something but I couldn't, all I could think was that I want to break up with her.

t2_3htm5khh,1553746569.0,b6eakz,t3_b6eakz,3,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for roughly two years now and for the most part it’s been amazing. I love her and her family and I often think we could end up getting married someday. However, there are a lot of small issues that I have with the relationship that seem to lead back to a lack of respect.

It doesn’t happen often, but there will be times that she talks down to me. She either uses a really rude tone or questions everything I do (especially when I’m driving). The amount of times she has said *”Why didn’t you do this?”* *”I told you to do this a different way”* is exhausting. 

Another thing that puts a strain on our relationship is distance. We live about 45 minutes apart and usually I’m the one that makes the commute. I’m fine with doing most of the driving, but what really bothers me is *every single time* I ask her to come over, she complains about how far the drive is. It has gotten to the point where I practically have to convince her to drive to my house once a month, while I drive to her house 3-4 times a week.

On a more serious note, I feel like she’s somewhat manipulative. My girlfriend is extremely stubborn and has apologized to me a total of maybe 10 times in our two years of dating. So, whenever we get into an argument, I always end up feeling like the one that’s in the wrong.

In nearly every argument we have, she usually blames me for everything, even when she did something wrong too. The line that bothers me most is “I can’t keep having this conversation with you” as if I’m being lectured by my fourth grade English teacher. 

I’m not the only one that notices this, either. Like I said, I love her family and we are all pretty close. I’m over at her place quite often, and there are a lot of times that her family (usually her sister) will call her out for how my girlfriend talks down to me.

I’ve known this girl from high school. We were good friends from sophomore year on and we had a brief thing senior year. Nothing serious just madeout a few times. We both went to college and went separate ways. Every once in a while we would see each other at parties but never did anything but talked.


Fast forward a few years and we ran into each other at a bar. She went home with me and we had a great night. Unfortunately I found out a month later that her boyfriend (2.5 year relationship) broke up with her 6 days before she came home with me.


At the time I realized this was a red flag but we were really hitting it off so I chose to ignore it. We hung out about twice a week for a few months and even took a weekend trip together. Everything was going great and she seemed very happy.


Last weekend she went on a trip with a couple of her girl friends. I could tell that something seemed different when she got back but she wasn’t saying anything through texts.


So she invited me over and when I walked in the door she started crying. She couldn’t tell me what was wrong but I could guess by her mannerisms.


She told me she was very confused and that she feels like she needs to experience life single. We talked for awhile and even shared some laughs and she cried a few more times.


She wouldn’t let me leave and would cry whenever I tried. I know she really likes me but I understand why she wants to be single. I can’t stop thinking about her and I can’t imagine her not in my life.

Well, it wasn’t the first video we watched. We watched his other video and when I asked him for the youtuber’s other video,  he chose the video.

2.  When we(all 4 roommates) were in the common area and were talking about something sex related. P brought of “edging” that was one of the category i was into. He kept saying “ don’t you like edging ? I fu@king love edging bro”
I felt weird him talking about it but quickly shook it off and didn’t really think about it. 
I didn’t want to over think and thought to myself why would anyone spend their extra time and be such a creep like going thru other’s internet history.

3. We had a house party recently and I came in late. I was tired from other events and didn’t drink and went into my room and closed the door. Then I heard some ppl outside (drunk) sayin “yo what is OP doing in his room “ and some other said “ haha prob jerking off”
Well- this conversation is not so sus, because we guys make many porn/sex/masterbation  joke casually. Lol we are in early- mid 20s and immature.
But sometime later one of my drunk friend(not P) came in and started talking about “prostate massage” that was one of the category i used to watch.  That drunk friend kept talking about it and like jokingly explained how to do it. At this point I felt very strange and started to back track what is going on. And i felt like P told not only my other roommates but also other ppl at the party about my porn history.

Tbh I thought to myself like this.
Even if P really did went thru and told everyone. I can just ignore. If he did, he is a rude piece of shit and I don’t have to deal with him. 
But sometimes when I get emotionally vulnerable (sudden depression maybe ? Or when things doesn’t go as I wishes in general)
I lose my confident and kept thinking about this and get paranoid. It is so humiliating and upsetting.

That is why right now, i couldn’t fall asleep and typing this at 2AM.  Im kind of shaking and want to stab him in his face (jk i will never do).
Plus, it just my guess... I dont think I have a hard evidence ?

Hey reddit, 
How should I deal with this.
Move on with my life , ignore this shit as it didn’t happen and its all in my head?
Should I straight up confront and ask him if he did ?

If I really find out P the piece of shit did such thing as i assumed, then how should I deal with the awful truth?

Thank you in advance !

Long distance doesn't really survive being long forever, so we talked about moving together. The situation we were in meant that I was the one to move to her, a different country. 

I couldn't make the move, and we instead ended the relationship. I have a stable job, family and friends in my home town, and I just couldn't let go of that.

t2_3hufx5gj,1553754900.0,b6fen6,t3_b6fen6,11,"I need some advice on an incompatibility between me and my boyfriend Seth. 

Seth grew up in a really strict but overall fair and loving home and he has some stress about doing anything he is ""not supposed” or ""not allowed"" to do. He sees rules and authority as something to be respected.

I on the other hand grew up in a pretty abusive situation in a pretty backwards hick town and most of the authority figures in my life ranged from neglectful to abusive. Didn’t help that I was outed as bi at 14 and had a lot of hate from teachers, school authorities, church leaders, etc. Overall, I got the impression that rules and regulations aren’t always just. And that there’s more important stuff in life than always doing what other people tell you is right.

I didn’t realize how different Seth and I were when we started dating. But over the two and a half years we’ve been together a lot of little things have cropped up as issues. 

One time, we were driving cross country to visit my parents, the trip would take 3 days, and we wanted to save money. I suggested folding down the back seats of my big SUV and putting my mattress in there so we could sleep in the back of the car. I’ve done it before and the car has plenty of room to stretch out, even with two people. And I knew good spots to park to not get bothered. Seth said no way, he wasn’t OK with sleeping in his car in places where that wasn’t allowed. I thought that was ridiculous, a big reason sleeping in your car is illegal is a part of the criminalization of homelessness. It’s bullshit IMO. Plus it wasn’t likely we’d get in trouble, if anyone did have a problem we could just say sorry and that we’d move along. But he said no way, and we ended up spending hundreds of dollars on hotels which really sucked for me because I was tight on money at the time.

I also often take walks at night or on off-days through this golf course near my home. I love nature and my city neighborhood doesn’t have much in the way of nature, except this huge golf course with ridiculous fees for a sport I do’t even care for. So after hours or on days golfing is closed, I’ll go for walks through the hills and woodsy areas, hang out by the pond, etc. I’ve brought friends out there for night-picnics and stargazing before. Yeah it’s technically trespassing but I think it’s kinda bullshit that the only big natural area in the neighborhood is monopolized by this sport that’s so prohibitively expensive, and is kinda shitty in other ways…All the water to keep the course green even when there is a water shortage otherwise? Long story short, I don’t feel too bad about trespassing on there. My friends and I never leave messes, often we’ll leave carrying more trash than we brought in. But Seth absolutely refuses to join me for walks even when I’d like to take a romantic moonlight walk or have a cute night picnic with him. It sucks because we’ll end up going out to eat, when picnicking would have been cheaper. If I’m going for a jog or picnic with my friends he won’t join either. I respected that he didn’t want to join us but he has started to nag me about going there myself, saying he is really anxious when I’m gone, knowing that I’m breaking the law. 

I’ve occasionally dumpster dived, I used to be way more into it when I was in high school and didn’t have a job. But one day my friend Jen and I were hanging out and Seth was there too, and Jen mentioned something she saw on the dumpster diving subreddit and said she thought she’d try it out. I told her that I’d done it loads, and gave her some advice. What kinds of places to hit up, what to do if someone confronts you about it, what to wear to keep yourself safe from nasty stuff, etc. And Seth got really really quiet during the conversation which I picked up on and changed to a different topic soon. He told me when we were going home that night that it really bothered him to hear me encouraging Jen to do something illegal. (For context, it is illegal in my area but tbh I think that’s another way to criminalize poverty, and it also leads to more stuff that could potentially be reused going to the dump.) So I told him that I didn’t think there was anything unethical about it, and he said I was missing the point. He was just anxious about the illegality of it all. He said he hated hearing me teach my friend how to break the law.

So I’ve been more sensitive about what I talk about in front of him, but it hasn’t completely solved the problem. It seems like some little part of how I live my life is always going to make Seth anxious, and I don’t know how to work on that. I don’t want to live my life exactly how he chooses to live his… But it feels like anything less will make him stressed and anxious and irritable. Any advice, reddit?

Now around midway through last year one of her friends from uni, that she had been spending a lot of time with, admitted to her that he liked her as more than a friend. She told me about this and ensured me that she made it clear there is no chance, since she is in a relationship with me and loves me a lot. She is still really close friends with this guy despite her knowing I'm not particularly fond of the idea of them hanging out.

She has recently been hanging out with a new guy who also tried to make a move on her and she once again rebuked his advances, telling him that she is in a relationship with me and that she loves me. She has also continued to be close friends with this guy, knowing that I dont approve.

These two okes are essentially now two very close friends of hers whom she speaks to regularly. I've spoken to her about it, saying that I really don't like it. Especially considering she and I know they want her. She says that she values their friendship too much to stop being such close friends with them.

I know for a fact that I can trust her to not cheat on me but on the other hand, I cant help but feeling that what she is doing is wrong and that she shouldve cut the friendships as soon as they disrespected our relationship (they were both aware of that fact, prior to making a move).

Am I justified in wanting her to cut off ties with these okes? Or am I being an unreasonable, jealous boyfriend?

Meaning we’ll go on two dates and then we somehow stop talking for like a month or two, either from my end or his. We went on a total of like 7 dates this past year. It’s very weird because we somehow always end up reconnecting and going out again. I can’t say the feelings are super strong but for some reason I always agree to see him again because when we are together the dates are very fun and the connection is great.

We have never slept together (if that isn't TMI) and a lot of the time it's me ghosting him only because from our conversations I feel like he is unsure of what he wants still . He lives a little far from me, which he does mention is a hassle to commute because he drives and I don't, so we only would see each other once a week when we would speak, and both of us have opposite schedules (he owns a business and needs to be there a lot and I start work when he is leaving his). So I feel like he wants to work as much as possible while he is young (24) and make a lot of money, and he doesn't maybe have time for a girlfriend or to commit to something. When we discussed this, He has told me in the past that he wasn’t sure if he was ready when he first met me to start something serious but he wants to try now and with me.

We reconnected two weeks ago and we both promised not to disappear, so far we text throughout the day and call each other every night and have nice, meaningful convos all night. I guess my question is: he asked me if I wanted to go on vacation and he’s serious on booking a flight 2 weeks from now, do you guys think I would be crazy for going?

I personally have always went away with my boyfriends that I have been with for a long time, but maybe I’m too old school ?

t2_p7862,1553752476.0,b6f3ik,t3_b6f3ik,2,"For about 12 years now, my family has been trying to help my brother get on his feet but every time it blows up in our face. My brother has had a lot of mistakes in his past that are putting him in a bad position to be independent and my parents are at their limits. While this has been an ongoing issue, the situation has gotten worse since I've been home from graduating undergrad last May.

&amp;#x200B;

 About 2 weeks after I came home, my brother quit his job because they weren't paying him overtime and working him thin, so he quit. My parents were not happy and emphasized he needed a job to be able to live here with no expenses. Since then, my brother has cycled through at least 10 jobs, with his longest time working being 3 weeks and most lasting about 3 days. He turns down/quits jobs before securing another and is picky about the type of job and pay. However, he's had issues with getting some jobs due to his background check (some misdemeanors of drug charges and obstructing justice) which was causing him the most frustration. We've tried to encourage that any job is good cause it's money in his pocket, but he doesn't buy it.

&amp;#x200B;

As of now his plan is to move out to the west coast and seek a job in the marijuana industry as it is his passion and he is determined to prove us wrong.  He plans to sell the car my parents gave him and use that to get out there until he finds a job. My mom is fine with giving him money to send him off, but tells him he is not allowed back if it doesn't work out. My dad does not think this is a good idea because it failed when he went to Colorado 3 years ago and ended up back here.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has made clear he can live here as long as he has a job. There were spells where he was unemployed for weeks and she was ready to kick him out because he showed little urgency to get a job. He would stay in his room all day, get high, eat and apply online day in and day out. He has blamed the reason for his woes on the stigma around weed, rich people, the area we live in, my parents not doing enough for him, my brother and I, our relatives and anyone who has even remotely slighted him in any way. We decided to try and get him mental health help as we were worried he may be getting depressed over his circumstances. In short, he REFUSED and a physical confrontation occurred between him and my mom which caused another legal problem for him. He reluctantly went to a few counseling session after that but has not been in months. My dad thinks his mental health is the reason for the turmoil and I will agree that his temper is BAD. He will blow up on a dime and is uncontrollable. He has said some of the worst things to people in those moments, which has lead to many problems that put him in his situation today. He also will damage walls/doors and threaten to hurt us or anyone. We have been on the receiving end a lot over the past 10 months and it is terrifying to come home and worry he may be set off. 

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is he will get to those levels of anger if my mom asks him even the simplest of questions about his day. This sparked him last night, when my mom asked him about his new job at a smoke shop he got, after quitting a sports bar gig. He told us in a round about way he wasn't getting paid so was looking elsewhere. My mom withdrew upstairs to cry and he proceeded to blow up at her and at us. He says he has to find a job that fits his school schedule and also ""respects him"". My mom went off and said she wants him out, however my dad won't let that happen since he is broke and not in a good place. At the end, my brother said he will leave in May when school is done, but we all know he will have to borrow $1000s of dollars from my parents to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

This ongoing issue has been tearing me apart for years. Tonight was the second-to-last straw on the camel's back as I feel the next confrontation will lead me to cut him off entirely. This also happened on my birthday (which has happened before) and it hit me harder in that way I think. I feel my family drifting apart because my brother doesn't know how to be independent and my parents feel they can't support him for much longer like this. They given him a nice car, money, and endless time both recently and over the past decade to help him and he has gotten nowhere. He treats them like shit too and I can't take it anymore. To be quite frank, I am losing hope and have no clue what to do. I've cried, screamed, given empathy to him and we are ending up in a deeper hole each year. I am starting school back up again this May, getting married in August and have a niece (other brother) I can't wait to watch grow up and don't want this problem to consume those things.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR; my brother's problems are consuming my family. We don't know how to help him keep a job and handle his anger in a proper way. I know this problem will never end if I don't do something about it.

I am planning on using a beam to set my joists on. My beam will be 24' long.  Originally I was thinking I would use 24' x 2 x 10 for the beam.  But unfortunately that length is hard to handle and transport.  If I use a 12' or a 14' instead, where / how would I split the seams along the beam? I am planning on using timberlocks to connect to my posts.  Kind of the same question goes for my ledger board.  If I use 2 - 12' instead of a 1 - 24', would that mean water would be more likely to get behind the ledger board since there is a seam in the middle?

I hope my questions make sense.   As stated, I'm a homeowner with some construction knowledge trying to build my first deck.  Thanks for the help!",DIY,Homeowner deck build questions

The Lutron Maestro switch has four wires - two black and a green (ground) and naked ground wire.

There's no indication on the switch of where the black and red wire attach.

How do I determine where the black and the red wires from the wall attach to the switch?

Does it matter which wall wire goes to which? 

I've installed switches before but they were the old screw types, so I'm at a loss here in my knowledge. Don't want to burn my house down!

purchased two from ebay: ""er16 collet chuck motor extension""  


i've had much luck with chinese tools, but this time... it was a terrible experience.  


the specs said if i purchased 8mm ID for motor shaft, I would receive 7.98mm shaft so i could induction heat it, then put it on the shaft  


however, i recieved 8.1mm oversized hole, so i couldn't use it... too much runout.  


took over a month for it to arrive, wasn't going to wait again.  


based on google and forums er collet chucks have 8 degree internal taper angle  


my compound was not gonna have the accuracy required,  


so i used a bevel protractor to get the precision within 0.1 degrees, which for ER collets is enough  


even greater precision could be set, if i purchased electronic bevel protractor, but it would cost me over $600 for quality one.  


i just went with vernier one, which wasn't too bad.

I have a big problem with the doors that open the wrong way ([see here](https://imgur.com/a/GroXyAT)). I don't know if this is a British thing, but as I am an architect and having designed loads of spaces, I was always told doors should open towards the room, not towards the wall. Needless to say, I found out why I was taught that. Opening the doors makes furniture really hard to arrange and this is already a small house, so I feel there is a lot of wasted space as well as the trouble of having to open the door almost 180 degrees to enter a room. 

I was thinking of flipping the doors but, as getting new doors would mean getting new linings, it's a bit over what we have in our budget for the works.

I need a little bit of assestment on this issue please. 
Im installing an LPG pipework which is a little bit particular due to regulation with boats in the UK (is for a boat) 

Main limitations

-The pipework has to be copper or stainlessteel or copper nickel. 

-The pipework has to be 3/8"" diameter

-There has to have a leak detector installed like Aldos 10mm 

https://gasproducts.co.uk/10mm-alde-marine-boat-gas-leak-detector-bubble-tester.html?currency=GBP&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw1KLkBRBZEiwARzyE77rjr8-IeTnGESPgZGwFIZnF2lfyNdKYymxFy-lzlraRQ8rt4pJ6MBoCVvIQAvD_BwE

(accorring to this video you can make it fit on a 3/8"" system https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw7reIiJZKI) 

---

Features of the installation. 
-Able to hook to whether butane or propane LPG cylinder. 

2 appliances connected
- 1 Gas hob Kampa Cucina (8mm quick release hose connector inlet) 
- 1 Gas water heater ""Optima Cob 5 Cointra"" 
(12 mm pipe inlet). 


-----

So I have designed the following draft where the outlet of the leak detector goes to a Tee which then has 2 pressure tests (dont know the name of the item) with 2 isolation valves for each appliance. 
I need to know if its possible to do the couplings and also if its a well designed installation.

----

Components

 3/8"" brass nuts 15 ish
3/8"" brass olives 15 ish
3/8 "" shut off valve (2)
3/8"" Equal tee brass
3/8"" pressure check Tee
3/8"" to 8mm quick release
3/8"" to 12mm pip

So my bf and I have been together four years. We have a very close group of friends, probably ten of us. My bf decided recently he wanted to put together a softball team and he organized everything. 

Anyway my sister (24f) mentions how we have a softball practice this Sunday. I mention to her that I have no idea what she’s talking about. She says that there’s a fb group talking about all this. So turns out my bf created a fb group for our softball team (ten of us) and forgot me to include me (I was the only one forgotten). There’s only ten people and he had forgotten to include me in the chat. I wouldn’t have discovered this unless someone brought it up (like my sister). 

So I’m sure I could probably look past this but these types of things have happened so many times. My boyfriend loves organizing so lots of friends will text him and say “hey you and x are invited to dinner next week”. But I’ll never hear anything about it until last minute. By that time, I believe I was invited last minute and therefore, an afterthought. It’s happened so much that I honestly believed that people didn’t want me around. My bf just says “I just expect you to know”. How could I know if you don’t tell me?? 

Anyway, this was almost the cherry on top. My own bf of four years forgot to include me in a group chat for over 24 hours,  where everyone else wasn’t forgotten to be added,  

When I brought it up how I felt, he rebutted with :

-I tried but it didn’t work (??)
-someone else’s gf wasn’t added (they been dating two months, we don’t even know her last name)
-well I didn’t do it intentionally 

When my sister said in the chat they he forgot to add me, all he said was “lol nice”. I’m honestly very hurt. I barely talked with him today because he just didn’t seem to care. 

Do I have a right to be upset and how should I approach this? 

TLDR: boyfriend created a fb group for all our friends but forgot to include me. Probably wouldn’t have included me because he had no idea he forgot to include me. Not his first offense at this. I feel upset ",relationships,I’m (25f) that my bf (27m) forgot to include me in a group chat

My current issue is that I am college touring with my mother over my school’s spring break, and as such, we are sharing the guest bedroom at a family friend’s house. I go to a school with a heavy workload and barely get five hours of sleep a night if I’m lucky, so I was really looking forward to this break to get some rest but that has, of course, been impossible.

While the simple solution would be to just bring up the issue, I feel extremely uncomfortable doing so. In the past, me mentioning it has caused her to say things like “I’m insecure about my snoring now,” or “I’ll never be able to date again because I snore,”.  Now, to avoid conflict, whenever she asks “Is my snoring loud? Does it wake you up?” I end up lying even though in reality it’s seriously affecting my quality of of sleep (which I really really do not get enough of in general.)

I know this is a very trivial problem in comparison to many here, but any advice is appreciated.

I need brutually honest unbiased opinions. 
Background: I’m two years older than my bf. We’ve been dating for 1 year and 4 months. Little rocky; but we’re very good together. We also have a baby. 

So, my dad is in the hospital in the ICU. I was in the waiting room. My bf had already dropped me off and left his phone with me because my phone had died.
I played some app games and texted my family to update them. 
I made a decision in which I never wanted to do. I looked through his browsing history. Before this, we talked about this and boundaries and loyalty. We agreed upon everything we discussed.
So, 98% of everything was harmless. Some porn which I’m totally okay with and I encouraged it because I haven’t been able to be intimate with him since having a baby in January, plus I don’t feel sexy in my body yet. But, I don’t completely derive him of sex. 
I found that he searched up a girl he knows onlyfans cam website. He tried to see if he could look at her stuff without having to pay for subscription. This girl has many mutual friends between the two of us. I don’t know her personally. He follows her on Instagram, Twitter and has her on Facebook.
We discussed this outside in the hospital parking lot. The talk consisted of confrontation, yelling, trying to compromise.. eventually, he apologized and asked if I would forgive him. I told him it’ll take me awhile to recover but I forgave him and he cried. 
After we were more calm, I asked why he did it. He explained that he was watching porn because we haven’t had sex in about 4 days or so (compared to everyday before I gave birth) he needed to release. After that, he stumbled upon her onlyfans page and searched her up. He said that his mind was on one track and soon realized what he did. He said he wanted to shrove it down and pretend it didn’t happen. 
I was upset because he always preached about talking to eachother when we did something wrong or felt upset. 
I looked and noticed he unfollowed her on twitter but kept her on insta and Facebook.
I feel quilty for disrespecting his privacy but now I know he broke our boundaries. I’m conflicted. 

Should I be worried about this? Should I move on?

Later on,  I began an affair with the daghter again and we still had two places so was wen her mother was gone... Anyway we told her an I fell in love with the daghter and she got pregnant again... And I ended it with her  mother and the secret and the drama was intense but in the end my  engagement with the daughter  again soured again primarily because of her cheating  and drug use we couldn't have around my own previous marriage issued child and the child we got back during our almost  marriage (engagement) .  Anyway social services became involved when the next child I had was born, she ha already run off with her coke dealer abusive boyfriend .  After a lengthy round with social services and heartbreak letting go of the mother of two of my children I go custidy.  I am now again friends ""platonic"" with her mother again an no contact still with her daughter who I still love greatly but know she can't Bea good mom to our children because of her drug use.  So we have no contact now for about a year and a half.  Me and her mother still love eachother but are both worried about what it would do to me an he daughters children if we dated again even if we did not tell them she is their grandmother until they were 18 or teenagers at least.   Should we stay strictly platonic and I should only date someone new and unrelated to my chikdren, despite my love and near perfect compatibility  with their grandmother who was almost my wife I I hadn't fell for the daughter again, we probably would have married.  Or I it best fo get chikdrens  sake to wait for the unlikely chance their mother may sober up one day and maybe even let he into my life and I their life again?  Everuome I know that I know now only a few family  members (who are obviously very judgmental o me an would be probably o the mother if we started dating again for obvious reasons)  know that the mom is the mother of my children's mother who still gets well with her daughter and cares greatly when she is sober and calls...it would be easy to keep this from most everyone  (the mother and daughter both know and have come to terms with it and the past  tho both also maybe have the same concerns for the children as I do).  Should I move on to someone else (date a stranger) because this can be toxic to the kids ... And especaloy I that don't work it would be ackward if the daughter ever actually sobers up and gets off the drug life ... And so dealing with her I know that I would have to stay away from her because there's a part of me that will always love her and be  unable to say no to her if she tried to seduce me again... I don't think I would ever cheat on the mother as long as I am never alone with the daughter again.... Or is all of this too messed up and I just need to raise the kids alone or perhaps eventually with  someone new and keep the relationship with the mother  strictly platonic and probably not be alone with her either?

Just been broken up last night with my girlfriend(23f) of 1 year and 5 months. She was my best friend and we had so much in common and loved spending time with each other. We didn't get along and would always fight over every little thing like insecurities,jealousy and other things.

Last night we talked about how she we're taking a break cause she wants to spend more time with family, friends and wants to go out more and tried to talk to her about working things out to where we can both compromise and be happy and healthy while still being with each other. We talk about why I get insecure about her talking to and hanging out with guys (I never stopped her or told her to not to do it and actually encouraged it to be able to deal with my insecurities) and I tell her the truth that I get insecure cause she used to sleep around literally until we started dating.
I instantly apologize but she begins to ""break up"" talk with me and tells me that I'm toxic and that I need to love myself and then proceeds to break up with me.

I feel sad that it ended and actually hoped to be with her for the rest of my life but now our relationship is over. I have close friends who are there for me and give me a shoulder to cry on but no one to really hangout with to help distract me from my fresh break up.

Sure I have small friendships here and there with them but I have never had a female best friend or a girlfriend. I do not really know why, maybe my lack of confidence, my general insecurity about being a but overweight (Im about 6’2 and 200lbs) or the simple fact that I am a generally reserved person with a VERY dark sense of humour that would obviously not attract that many girls. The most I have ever been through was one botched date last year.

Now, Im in high school and my chemistry teacher has us paired in groups of two for experiments, always groups of one boy and one girl. My crush was new to the school I go to and we ended up being paired together. During the time since September, I have gradually been acquiring feelings for her. She is smart, funny, pretty, the whole package really.  I can hold decent conversations with her in that class. I have nearly all my classes with her (french school) but when I talk to her outside of chemistry class, she is generally pretty indifferent to what I am saying, which is not the case with other boys sadly.

I do not know what my next course of action should be. Some of my friends have told me to pursue trying to get her right now, others have tild me to try and lose some weight and start caring more for my general appearence before making any moves while some have told me to give up and move on.

Recently she has been dating this guy (28M) for almost 4 months and I have noticed that she is very consumed by this relationship and I am concerned she is being blinded by this person.

The new each other through a mutual friend and after 2 weeks they started officially dating. She is broke and her dad lost her job, and she has been struggling with rent ($900/month), keeping in mind that her parents pay for her rent (she is a fully dependent financially college student). Her mom is a hair dresser which barely makes the bills. She hasn’t been living at our apartment (we share a room) for the past 4 months she has been living with him (we have a contract that she would have to pay more to get out of it) and she has been pretty much living with her boyfriend, even tho her parents are barely making the rent to an apartment she doesn’t step foot in.

Before the relationship she lost scholarship for poor grades in a private school and had to transfer out. Currently I haven’t seen her touch her books, and has been distracted quite a lot. About once a month she will sleep at the apartment and the boyfriend  decided to come over and sleep with her ( our beds are right my each other). They literally can’t be physically apart.

I find her boyfriend sketchy in the sense that SHE DOESNR EVEN KNOW WHAT HE ACTUALLY DOES IN HIS JOB, only that he works in commission for a security company. He wears designer shoes, takes her out to $200 bill dinners, gets her expensive stuff, but the weirdest thing is that he is 28 and RENTS OUT  a room in a house. He doesn’t even own a place. I’ve asked my friend about his college education and she doesn’t even know about it ( not even sure if she is interested in knowing). 

Anyways, I’ve grown up in a rich environment and none of the “goods” he gives her or tries to pay for my food bills when I go out w them gets to me. I definitely see something weird about how he is 28 and the things he does. Definitely more worried about my friends’ future in the sense that she is first gen college student and I can see her dropping out and marrying this guy (she isn’t a great student either). 

THE OTHER DAY I FOUND A BRUISE ON THE BACK OF HER NECK. Very large and obvious. I asked her how the heck she got that and she says that she “doesn’t know” and that it didn’t hurt. I really doubt that someone wouldn’t know how they got a bruise especially since it’s very obvious. I rubbed it w alcohol making sure it wasn’t dirt and looked closely that it wasn’t a rash, but I’m 95% sure it’s a bruise.

Not even sure how to approach this situation or get her to realize how inconsiderate she is being to her parents and that being 28 and having those types of things really do seem sketchy, especially when I mentioned about her bruise and she seemed brush it off.

Help and advice on how to approach this situation w/o making her feeling she is getting attacked or her relationship attacked.

I really love this guy. We’ve been together for three and a half years, we’ve had our ups and downs but we consider each other best friends.

I work full time, look after all the bills and the grocery shopping, and he’s only just begun contributing to this - life is a little bit easier now that we have a little extra income. However I work full time and go to the gym, I do my best to maintain a good shape, and sometimes I am exhausted by the end of the day. Today and yesterday especially, I’ve been drained. He said that I am boring and difficult, and all I do is lay in bed and go on my phone. Having said this, he’s been in bed all day and gaming, and was even gaming when I was sat next to him talking to him about my day. Part of the reason why I got in bed is because it’s boring watching him game.

This is a stupid issue, I know, but I am so tired of coming home and having a nagging voice in my ear. He often calls me names, one of them being “fatty” or “fat f**k” his logic being that I am not fat so he can get away with calling me it. Apparently it’s a compliment. He also knows about my past with eating disorders, anorexia to be specific, and often calls it “bimborexia”. I’m just so tired. When we get along well, it’s great, but lately I’ve been having thoughts of how the single life would be so much better, but I’m also really scared of losing him. I’m torn and I don’t know what to do, I need advice on whether I’m being too sensitive or not.

I need some advice please.. my partner and I were long distance when we started our relationship, we moved to a new city for a year before I agreed to move to his home town, as he was unhappy in the city that we were living in.

We have been here for 5 years now, I have completed my degree and been offered my dream job in a smaller town which is 35 miles away. 

I had discussed this with my long term partner prior to applying and he said to go for it, though he wasn't entirely happy. We plan to move when I graduate regardless, as we live in a tiny house currrntly. I feel that I have compromised by not demanding that we move to the town where I will work, but that we move 1/3 of the way from here to make things a little easier. He would then have a commute of 20 minutes and mine would be 35 minutes. 

Now that I have been offered the job he has changed his mind and been really quite nasty, saying that I am selfish and I should do a full 60 minute commute as ""I chose this"". I have tried to apply for jobs in his home town, but nothing that would benefit my career has become available. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me. 

My other concern is our dog, who I wouldn't be willing to leave for that many hours a day. He is not willing to skip the gym to come home early to walk her. He does not have any other responsibilities or commitments.

I have offered long distance, but he isn't willing to do that either.

What the F do I do? I need to let the job know in the next 48 hours. 

TL;DR: boyfriend would rather that I do a 60 minute commute than add 10 minutes on to his journey to work, making it 20 minutes, for my dream job post graduation. Because ""I chose this"".

I am a recluse and shy guy, who usually keeps himself busy with stuff(like sports, public speaking,writing and studying) so I usually don't interact, but there is a girl at my college who caught the corner of my eye. Me being my shy self, didn't interact with her until the next semester. We had a small conversation about our maths class, then about our DLD class and then she asked me to help her with DLD as she wasn't doing well in the subject. I left my cricket practice ( was selection day and I was already selected) and we connected. We became good friends and I started talking to her every day for at least an hour(unlike me) and she would reply pretty quickly( mostly). So one day I played well in a match and she asked me for a party and I agreed to it. I couldn't do it the same day as I couldn't reach college on time from our ground. So I said sorry and how I was looking forward to it and rescheduled it for the next day.
I confirmed it 3 hours prior and cancelled my drama practice but she didn't show up.

Today she replied to my story but I didn't answer back without even looking at the text just saw the notification, then I posted another story and she replied to it but she didn't bring up anything about the dinner.

I graduate from college in about a month, and I plan on pursuing a career in her city, Chicago. I stay 750 miles away from there currently, but I have been to Chicago many times. I love the city and I have always wanted to live there. Big Cubs fan. But in all honesty, I know that her being there is a huge part of why I am dead set on moving there. And that truly scares me. I just have fears that I am going to get there and things won't work out. As much as i love that city, being heartbroken there does not sound too appealing. And a mf has had his heart tore up from tha FLOOR up in the past

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, I know if I do not move there, and I don't try to act on these feelings, I will regret that shit forever. This is legitimately the girl of my dreams. Fuck i cant believe i'm typing this for strangers on the internet, I feel like I am answering my own question anyway. I have done so much planning to make this become a reality, which is so strange for me, I am absolutely shit at planning. But I am putting in the work because I am motivated by her. I've just never had this feeling before. I have a new lil record coming out next month, and one of the songs on it is for her, its a stripped piano and guitar ballad basically outlining everything I feel for her. And no its not some B-grade cringe shit music its industry quality, just trust me its a beautiful song. Id link my spotify on some shameless plug shit but a mf aint trying to reveal his identity out here and yall probably wouldnt even believe it was me anyway. But yeah the song is dope, I feel like i'm going full John Mayer in this mf, I'm really on some ""your body is a wonderland"" energy out here. I am a soft boy at heart. The song is gonna be called A. I just wanna make this happen, and for the first time in my life I'm willing to put in the work.

Basically what I am asking is... should i do this, should i make this move? Or am i making a fucking crippling mistake moving to a new city just for a girl? That action is so unbelievably out of my element. But I want her. And so many signs point to her wanting me too. We have talked about it a lot, and we seem to be on the same page about what we want out of this. Even if it doesnt work, I get to start my new life in a city I love.

t2_3htj9uuv,1553745214.0,b6e3jz,t3_b6e3jz,3,"This ex and I dated for a little over a year, and to me, that relationship represents the lowest point of my life. He was a really emotionally abusive guy who for some reason thought he was the world's greatest boyfriend.

We broke up around two years ago, which sounds reasonably long enough that living across from him wouldn't phase me, but the terms we ended on were absolute shit. Right after we broke up, I found out I was pregnant. He didn't want to believe me, even accused me of lying, so I had to deal with the abortion, bills, everything myself.

After that, he would occasionally text me, regardless of the several times I had asked him not to contact me. He's the type that can't stand feeling guilty, so I lied and said I was totally okay with things because I knew that would be the only way to get him stop. He's not the best at taking other people's feelings into consideration.

Just a few days ago, I saw him in person for the first time in a while, and I genuinely felt like I was experiencing PTSD. I thought I would be able to handle things, but I felt myself start to panic and get really anxious. This isn't something that I experience with any of my other exes - just this one particular guy.

The fact that I'm supposed to be living across the street from him next year was completely coincidental. I only found out after signing the lease, but now I'm debating breaking that lease. I don't know if it's a worthwhile things to do, though, or if there's another way I can address this - either to him or a possible therapist.

t2_b6f9tnf,1553710089.0,b67jsu,t3_b67jsu,8,"Basically, I’ve known this guy since I was 17. Met him through work. He quickly took on somewhat of an ‘older brother’ role and I became friends with him, his friends, and his wife. 

All we used to talk about was what movies and books we liked, Dungeons and Dragons, work, etc. It was a shallow friendship because we didn’t really talk about feelings often other than reaching out to say “hey I know you’re having a tough time, you’re always welcome to come hang out.” But it was a friendship I enjoyed for the most part. 

Recently I went out with him alone for the first time as he divorced his wife. Every other time I’d seen him outside of work before this he had his wife or his family with him. I brought my boyfriend with me so they could meet (we’ve been dating six months now).  

This is where it gets crazy. First he tells my boyfriend “if you ever hurt her, I’ll kill you” which was quite embarrassing but I let it go. Then we walked outside after dinne, where my boyfriend sees a Ferrari and casually mentions he’s had the privilege to drive a few of them from a previous (completely legal, normal) job he’d had where he had to drive cars for the owners. 

My friend visibly freaks out a bit and starts saying he worked with a gang, he has beaten people before, he’s stolen Ferraris etc. I know this isn’t true because I know how he grew up and what he did while he was younger, and he never mentioned any of this to me. I think he was just trying to impress bf but it came off horribly. I might also mention he’s an obese man who doesn’t get out much, stayed in our hometown of ~500 people, and married at 18, so I highly doubt that he really did any grand crime. 

Adding to this, now he’s told me a few other really unbelievable stories; that not one, but *two* girls have ran into a bar bathroom stall to hook up with him, that he drank 20 shots and 60 beers on St Patty’s in one sitting, he’s drank an entire torso sized jar of moonshine in one sitting and walked home fine, he’s been struck by lightening twice, etc. He told me he was going on a date with a girl and showed me a photo of an obviously fake Facebook profile, it looked like one of the ones where people sign up with an attractive photo of a girl to scam others. She only had one photo of herself and she was in lingerie, no posts besides lewd links. 

My boyfriend thinks my friend is dangerous because of all the lies (he says he thinks friend’s lying to cover up some aspect of himself) and says he gets a bad gut feeling, which I respect. He hasn’t told me to stop being his friend (my boyfriend’s not controlling at all) but has made it known how uncomfortable he is around this dude, which I don’t blame him for. It’s just blowing my mind because he didn’t act this way before he divorced his wife, he’s like a totally new person.

In September we will be leaving the same school to go to different universities and study different subjects, although they are in the same city (walking distance). A week abroad with just the two of us is also booked. We have always had slightly different interests, but they overlap in areas and we have so much fun together. We have been through some very trying times together and I (perhaps naively) honestly thought we would stay together until the end.

I don't want to give up on this relationship; I love him to pieces and want to be there to help him succeed in his field and see him happy. Of course, I will respect his decision if he does decide that he wants to break up after we try getting close again.

I was wondering if anyone had any other tips of things to do to rekindle our relationship, or mindsets to take on etc.? I am unsure on what to do and would be interested in hearing other's experiences also.

t2_3hinjvgw,1553720698.0,b69qxv,t3_b69qxv,6,"Need input from some outside perspectives. Its a bit of a story to where we got to from last week. In December, my girlfriend and I are were on a cruise with her family. Well, a couple of times she got really drunk on the cruise. The first time, she made out with the bartender(didn't tell me at the time why). The second time, she goes off on me on if I was ever going to propose and if there was a future for us. I tell her that there's a future and that we can fix whatever issues we have. She then proceeds to tell me about an old friend she hasn't seen in many years; tells me that she still loves him; I tell her to try and reach out to him to try and receive some sort of closure, but she says no, it would hurt too much. She then goes to the next subject that we should immediately get married and starts asking what we should name our kids. After the cruise she suggests that we go see a couples counselor and read this book together. I initially agree, but I honestly thought she was feeling very guilty about she was on the cruise and some things were exaggerated. For whatever reason I decided to not read the book and couples counseling was never brought up again and we never really discussed the more serious issues that were presented on the boat.

This caused some rifts for her, but not me. I felt I was fairly understanding of the situation. We decided to start doing date night, try and get out of the roommate funk we were in. About 3 weeks go by and she applies for a job in Florida where she'll have to move there by May. We always talked about moving somewhere warm year round; Her parents and grandparents live there, while all of her sibling and rest of the family are in the current state we reside. This isn't the first time she tried applying for jobs in Florida, but I talked her out of it before because I felt I wasn't ready for that yet. 

Fast forward from January to March, I'm trying to put my best foot forward on getting a plan together for myself(Applying to go back to school and looking for jobs); I was planning on staying through the summer to save a little extra money(pay for what I do down there was a little bleak). I even fly down to Florida to look at the area myself to scope the area out and look at a college. During the course of that time, I notice that she starts to pull away. Only says I Love you when I say it first; Doesn't hold hands or cuddle anymore. I chalked it up to her thinking I'm not going to make it to Florida and it'll get better once were there(stupid me). 

Come end of March, my girlfriend had to go out of state for some work-training for a few days. I pick her up from the airport and have a nice drive home; As soon as we get through the door she instantly says we have to talk. She mentions how she reached out this guy from her past(that she told me about on the cruise) and that they've rekindled whatever feelings they had(he lives in a different state and will have to stay there for the next 2 years) and says she thinks that we should end and insists that her talking to this guy again had nothing to do with her decision.

Over the course of the next couple days I try to talk to her about what is going on and why did it come to this. The first few tries leads to nothing that really explains why were breaking up. It isn't until I say I don't believe her that this guy had no sway on her decision. She then begins to tell me that I wasn't doing certain things, like, not telling her how beautiful she is when we go out for nice dinners, or not waiting for her when she gets home from work. Goes on again how we feel like roommates. She also tells how I'm not being so great with her nieces and nephews and also criticizes how I would try to initiate in intimacy(we had long bouts without sex). Its also brought about how we never did counseling(was only brought up once by her on vacation). She admits that there are things she could've done different and could've communicated about better. I tell her these are things I'm willing and knowingly can do to improve. This seems like a minor speed-bump that we can work out. Every time I ask why can't fix it she says it'll be too hard with the move and then goes on, again, about how she loves this guy still and owes it to herself to see how things turn out, but insists that he's not swaying her decision. 

A lot of these issues started to show their ugly face in about December. I didn't recognize just how bad they were because I thought a lot of it was exaggerated from the bad nights she had on the cruise. A lot of this came to head last week when she felt fed up and unloaded on me. I just didn't really understand how bad things were and how unhappy she really was, but she never brought any of these issues up until it was boiling over I feel.  Communication is a two-way street, but I feel like I'm putting it all on myself for not doing my part in asking if everything was ok and if she had any concerns from time to time.i Just feel like we didn't know how to talk to each other. Its something that I know we can work through now that its been put out there in a serious fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you're all doing well.

&amp;#x200B;

I broke up with my girlfriend last night. To say I'm sad is an understatement. But I'm doing all the right things to get through this and not wallow in sorrow. Deleted the photos, contact, and messages. What i really wanted was a view point from a 3rd person. 

Our relationship was great. I've never met someone who I connected so much with. Our communication was brilliant and the chemistry was amazing. Also we were each others first relationship.

**Some background information on the two of us:** I am someone who is cold on the outside but warm on the inside. People's initial judgement of me is that of a jerk and unapproachable while she is someone who is a polar opposite. She is approachable, humorous and in possession of an infectious nature filled with love on the outside. People are drawn to her like one would be to a celebrity of their liking. But, she is cold on the inside(according to her words). I had an affluent childhood(**read:** spoiled rich brat) and parents who doted on me and made me feel like the sun shined out of my bum while she's from a family with lesser economic means and parents who are good people but were distant throughout her life. 

In our first meeting we HATED each other. Downright loathing is the right usage to describe that. I found her annoying and fake and she found me rude and egotistical. But from there we kept meeting on and off, learning about the other in more depth and in time, we realized how wrong we both were in our initial appraisal of each other. We started a friendship which grew and developed into a relationship. 

She told me when we started dating that we are two completely different people, and based on her cold nature she doesn't know if she is capable of love and if I would give her time to grow which I was happy to. Also she is not asexual as such, but not exactly that sexual also. It was all new for her and she would take time to get used to it. Even after we had established a somewhat similar rapport on our sex life, penetration rarely happened because it caused her physical pain to attempt and so we only tried it when she wanted to. 

We were in the same country for 10 months and we lived a lifetime's worth of memories in the time together. Seriously, someone would be able to make a movie based on everything we went through, lol. There were highs and lows, near death experiences, visiting new countries, spending a night together far out in the ocean on a boat that seemed possessed and so much more. Easily one of the best periods of my life. There were obviously roadblocks along the way in terms of mismatched libidos, personalities and varied reactions to an event. But as i said, with our level of communication we got through it all and it was good, reddit. It was so good.

In the height of our relationship she told me I was perfect and how I taught her patience, love and a lot of things which were alien to her and I told her how she brought me out of my shell of negativity and self loathing which I had worn for so long. She taught me about purpose, will to live and work hard and to have a positive outlook on life in general. How to stand up to the people I love most and not let them conform me to a life I wasn't interested in. If there was ever a perfect relationship at that point, it was ours.

But she is someone for whom her career comes first, always. She has always been an overachiever and I know she will go on to become one of the greats in her field of choice. For this purpose she moved to a better position in a new country. And long story short, it all fell apart. I put in the effort to stay in touch, to call and keep the romance going. She put in the bare minimum. I got needy due to her coldness and she accepted her fault and tried to force a change which wasn't successful.

A few things I'd like to clarify, I have 100% certainty there was no infidelity, or that she is a person who uses and disposes of people. She is a genuinely good person with the best of interest at heart for everyone. She will be the greatest friend you can have. 

She said it feels forced for her to keep in touch, to call everyday, and it shouldn't be like that. She said she doesn't love me like I do her and everything she felt for me when we were in the same country has come to a standstill for her. She was honest and upfront with everything she felt and says that it's not right for her to continue this since I will be the one suffering. She says I am perfect but she's not in love with me. She doesn't get the butterflies or the need to make an effort and it shouldn't be as such if she was in love with me. She had told me she loved me when we were together towards the 9th month or so and a few times later when we had those lovestruck moments, she would say it or something similar which made me feel loved.

So it's just this point that i wanted some clarity on. Is that what love really is? You need to feel the butterflies and the yearning, because there were days when i didn't want anything to do with her and there were days when I loved her so much I thought my heart would burst. Both are part and parcel of a relationship I believed. Also i used to think love is a choice you make, not just a feeling you need 24\*7. 

Now i'm sitting here with the numerous memories and the warmth of the love I had received thinking how it's possible for someone to just switch it off. Long distance does put a strain on every couple and we did meet a few times in between where it seemed like nothing had changed and we were back to being happy. But the cycle continued once we went back to our countries of residence.

Anyway I've ranted on for long enough. SO if any of you have had a similar experience where you had a wonderful relationship with someone you deemed perfect but then stopped loving or realized you didn't love can you please explain why you felt so and/or what the other person did wrong?

 

TL:DR; Brokeup after a year of near perfect relationship. She said she feels like she's forcing herself to love me and that's not right. Don't understand and looking for views from people who faced a similar experience.

Ground is frozen and there is no where for water to go. Heavy rain expected soon, so I thought I could rig this up to run water far away from the foundation, otherwise my grading is messed up and excess water will run into a basement window well and flood.

I thought that as long as the water level in my barrel is higher than the end position of my hose, that gravity would be sufficient to generate enough water pressure to move the water through the hose??? With this current set up my barrel just overflows from the top with zero water coming from the end of the hose.

Some points to consider:

* It is not practical for me to raise the barrel off the ground, I can maybe get an extra foot of elevation under it if more pressure is needed
* The valve is open and the hose is not obstructed
* No point of the hose is ever close to being higher than the water level in the barrel as it runs towards the back of my yard
* the seal between the valve and the barrel drips ever so slightly but I wouldn't think this would drop pressure significantly?
* Do I need a wider hose? Shorter Hose?
* What if I placed a new valve higher up on the barrel such that the valve and subsequent water level was always higher than the highest point of my hose?

Why is this current set up not working? What am I missing?

Any help greatly appreciated!

My husband and I decided to replace a couple hardwood floors in our home.

Problem is the flooring we got is thicker than the original. This wouldn't normally be a problem, if it weren't for our baseboard vents, pictured below.

[https://imgur.com/bfMWUwh](https://imgur.com/bfMWUwh)

https://i.redd.it/ewibx1tweql21.jpg

Unfortunately we didn't notice this issue until we were ready to install the new flooring.

As you can see, the old, thinner, flooring was able to just rest under the bottom edge of the vent, but the new flooring is about twice as thick as the old, so it comes up over the vent.Here's another photo to provide a close up of what I'm talking about.

[https://imgur.com/yxpJ52A](https://imgur.com/yxpJ52A)

https://i.redd.it/hh33b6hgfql21.jpg

Raising the vents isn't really an option. Our home was build back in 1892, and the walls are still the original plaster (I suspect possibly in poor condition in the room in question due to what we've been able to catch a peek of from behind the paneling, but good everywhere else) and cutting out a hole above our baseboard and adding ductwork to raise the vents is going to be slightly too ambitious for what we can afford to do time and money wise at the moment.

Not to mention it might mean also having to replace all the baseboards as they'd then have giant holes in them, and we're quite fond of the all the old woodwork in the house.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm concerned about the expansion gap. We obviously can't just leave a gap between the flooring and the vents. In addition to that just being dumb, it would create a dust trap.

Along the rest of the baseboard the gap will be hidden with quarter round, but I feel like we cant just board over the vent with quarter round either. What if we needed to remove the vents for any reason? (cleaning, etc.) We'd need to tear off the quarter round to get to them. (However, if this is the only answer, please let me know.)

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose another option could be to just forgo the expansion gap around the vents, as they might still be easy enough to remove if needed with just the flooring over a bit of the bottom with no quarter round on top. However, I'm not sure if this would be a correct solution or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Another, though smaller, problem, is our entrance door.

[https://imgur.com/N41J74G](https://imgur.com/N41J74G)

https://i.redd.it/0959ewycjql21.jpg

Like the vents, the old flooring seems to have just slid under that board below the weather strip, and obviously the new flooring cannot.

Would it be better to pull up the weather strip, lay the floor, then replace weather strip over the flooring with a thinner wooden board underneath?

Or should we just lay the flooring with the expansion gap and perhaps throw down some molding to cover? (The door would still open, but I'm concerned about tripping risks and to be honest I'm also concern it might just look stupid.)

&amp;#x200B;

I've googled around and searched this sub for answers but found nothing that could really help our problem. Could someone help me determine the best solution? Any help at all is appreciated. Thank you in advance!

**Backstory:**We replaced all the flooring in the house with engineered hardwoods. We used a contractor from lumber liquidators. Overall, we've been very pleased with the work.

However, there was a huge issue with our AC unit where the condensation pan was draining into an open pvc pipe. The pvc pipe clogged/got full, and the water overflowed the top of the pvc pipe and just leaked into the wall. The leak was behind our laundry machine, so at first when we saw water coming up between the wood, we brought in a plumber to take a look. He couldn't find anything, and chalked it up to the washer hose not draining properly. Replaced it, charged us parts, went on his way.

It wasn't till much later when the problem got worse that we went into the AC and found the real issue. It's been about a year now and we have not had any excess water, but the flooring in that area has been completely destroyed. Warped to the point of popping out entirely, subflooring (underlayment?) displayed and everything.

**TLDR:** Leak messed up my floor real good. Leak definitely fixed, but need to replace flooring.

My wife and I want to DIY some new tiling in the area, as it is our mudroom/laundry anyway. 

The space is almost exactly 5'x12'.

My real questions are:

1. We've never tiled before. Is this something we can tackle? An area slightly larger than a bathroom that's rectangular and empty? I've done my research and I think yes, but my wife is particular and picky so...
2. The big one: What do I do about the transition? (See picture above) Currently, it's a seamless go between the area we are looking at tiling and the kitchen. Can I just get a jigsaw right there at the ""seam"" at the door casing, add tile, then a t-mold? 

Thanks for any advice or tips for a first-time tile-layer.

There is a stack to the left of the sink. It currently drains the kitchen sink on the first floor and vents through the garage roof. If I run 7 feet of pipe following the wall, I would need to connect to the drain where the cleanout is. Can I install a tee fitting on the bottom of the stack and the cleanout just above it? I think I could make the vent connection in the garage attic, so I should be able to tee off the drain pipe just before the stack and run it up parallel to the stack to make the connection in the attic.

-we've been very close/best friends for 2 years

-neither of us are very experienced with/haven't been concerned with dating or relationships until now so the feelings and idea of it are pretty foreign, especially for her

-I told her how I feel/initiated and we've gone on a few dates

-we've talked in detail multiple times about how whether we end up dating or stay only platonic our friendship will be a-ok! And I meant that 100%!

-because of our inexperience it's VERY innocent and soft, so it'll probably seem silly! But I'm wondering if this is normal!

We had a talk after our last date where she was SO upset because she has feelings for me but.. only part of the time? Butterflies, sweaty palms, intense stuff. She's had moments where she wants to kiss me and had said she likes to hold hands and cuddle. She had fun on our dates... But she said she feels guilty because she only feels those really lovey dovey feelings for me part of the time.

I think this is pretty natural, especially since we've known eachother in a non-romantic way for so long, and I told her as much... I don't consistently feel that way either and I'm the one who has conviction about how I feel! It's more like... I think she's beautiful and enjoy spending time with and talking to her! And I get warm fuzzies quite a bit but it's not like... a constant thing! 

I don't think there's any wrong way to like someone, and I don't think feeling feelings even part of the time is /nothing/ and she agreed... she admitted she looks at other people's relationships (another friend's specifically) and sees how CRAZY in love they are and feels the need to compare how she feels to that... to which I said we're all different people so no two relationships will be the exact same...

I made sure she knew I wasn't saying any of this because I was trying to change her mind or pressure her... but I'm wondering if I have the right mindset here! I believe everything I said, but I'm inexperienced so I'm wondering if I'm being too idealistic... can all of you sage wise relationship experts of Reddit tell me if this is a normal way for her to feel in a romantic relationship? Or is the fact that she doesn't ""feel it"" 100% of the time more telling than I think it is?

TL;DR- My best friend turned kinda girlfriend feels guilty because she only feels romantically (wanting to kiss, cuddle, sweaty palms, butterflies) some of the time, not all of the time whereas I feel like this is normal in a relationship, especially one where we already know each other so well!

t2_3htbgicc,1553741604.0,b6djvj,t3_b6djvj,7,"I was with my ex for 4 years and she broke up with me 2 months ago. We had some issues but nothing too serious (apparently). A little over a year ago, we started to get along with Jackie. Jackie is apparently a nice girl. A bit too loud and causes a bit of drama.

At first I was wary of her. I just couldn't put my finger on it but I couldn't trust her. My ex adored her. I was specially bothered when she came on to me a couple of times. Eventually I convinced myself it was all in my head (and maybe it was). I know I never felt comfortable describing those events to my ex. I never felt the slightest temptation to stray with her. I was always 100% loyal.

Jackie is apparently a very nice person. She's attractive and guys immediately notice her. I never got that. But, also, she's too loud. She talks too much and makes everything about her. Her love life is a train wreck the worse I've ever seen. She would often complain men were bastards and not realize she would invariably gravitate towards the worst kind of men. Numerous times I confronted her with this. This culminated with a guy that was playing with her for months. My and my ex warned her over and over about him and she would end up in a backseat with him every time. In the end she got pregnant and the guy disappeared. She had an abortion and I had to be the one to be there for her for doctor appointments, procedure and support. I was pissed off but had no heart to leave her hanging during such an ordeal.

Now that me and my ex are over I've realized a few things. She contributed heavily to the end of our relationship. Intentionally or not. She would often throw observations that would make my ex insecure about the relationship. Some of our biggest fights started with seemingly inoffensive remarks from her, including the final were she ended up breaking up with me. I can clearly see now the downturn in our relationship coincided with her starting to hang with us (the 3 of us, yes). She even went on a vacation with us because my ex insisted. I ended up feeling like the 3rd wheel and we had our biggest fight (by far) during that vacation. All because she mentioned the 2 of them would be spending a day together, leaving me alone on vacation all day. My ex hadn't even agreed to that. But she couldn't put her foot down, was very harsh and rude to me and dealt with the situation horribly. She also insisted I should apologize to Jackie for making her feel uncomfortable. In the end we made up, but I can see now our relationship was damaged irreparably after that fight.

When we broke up Jackie said she was there for me and became the only road of communication between me and my ex (which I soon cut off). She insisted I could count on her for venting and would make sure I wouldn't have to cross paths with my ex (as was my wish). She insisted my ex wouldn't be looking for another relationship soon so I wouldn't have to worry about crossing with her and the new guy. I was clearly the one who was hurting more of the two and she was friends with both equally. I believed her at first. Soon I started to realize the negative influence she had on the relationship.

This week she started filling Facebook with pictures of my ex, unidentified without any warning. I was doing good and suddenly my feed was full of pictures of her. She never posted pictures of them on Facebook. Now they're everywhere. Pictures of the two of them taken by her male friend. And I know she's trying to get them together. Less than a week ago we were having coffee and I was venting how I was dealing with the whole break-up. Less than 2 months after it all. I impulsively blocked her and she hasn't realized that.

Sorry for the venting. I'm slowly starting to get better but I'm still in a bad place. Am I seeing too much in this or is Jackie really not who I thought she was?

Hello. So as per the title, I \[17/M\] have been experiencing rather negative emotions towards my girlfriend \[17/F\] and do not know how to calm them.

So context. My girlfriend and I have actually had a rather difficult relationship. We're young and dumb so this is to be rather expected. I have been meaning to make a post for a while but have not yet gotten around to it because I wanted to ask her first and wanted to get the story straight in my head. Anyway this post is not asking for overall advice but rather, advice to a specific situation.

Okay so more context. My girlfriend and I have been dating for over a year. She is my first girlfriend because I decided, back when my peers started dating, that I would hold off on dating until I felt a good connection and understanding with someone and knew I could handle a partnership. She however, got into a toxic relationship with a high school senior early on and I met her while it was going on. After getting to know her and learning her situation, I supported her as much as I could and eventually helped her out of her toxic position. I cannot take full credit obviously but I was her shoulder to cry on. So after a while, and once I had decided she'd had enough time to get over her ex and I was ready, we started dating. She apparently had not actually gotten over her ex (which I do not blame her for) and still tried to talk to him via phone or text on occasion (as she is a highly social person and thought that it would help). This made me incredibly insecure and intimidated because this is my first relationship and I thought her still trying to communicate with him was a bad sign. After it stopped working, she took my advice (and her built up anger, frustration, and hatred) and decided to block him and drop contact. This made me very happy until a few months later she was guilty and talked to him again.

Anyway this was a while ago and she had dropped communication again, which again made me more comfortable. But recently we got in a fight (which is what I really wanted to post about but I still don't have entirely worked out in my head) and she ignored me for five days (and only came back because one of my friends guilted her because he saw I was lonely). We talked and whatnot and are working together again. Unfortunately, I saw a few days ago that she was talking to her ex again (and for the first time was hiding it (would tilt phone away from me while texting)). Yesterday I was in the best mood I had been in in a while (because we were not okay and id been really sad) and she killed it by informing me he would be coming by the next day to visit. I tried really hard the rest of the day to be supportive because I know shes just trying to fell okay or something (I do not fully understand it but I empathize) but it has made me super uncomfortable. So today she left and went MIA for 8 hours. I figured she was just busy with life and homework or whatever and saw him for an hour or so. Anyway I messaged her throughout the day (as I normally would) and asked how it went (as I am trying to be supportive). Turns out she actually spent 8 hours with him today and shes being rather unspecific about what they did. While it isn't unusual for her to spend the better part of a day walking and talking with a friend, 8 hours with her ex has me emotionally distraught.

On top of this, I asked her if we could spend this day together (It is a day off school and we both work weekends so we rarely get a full day) but she declined due to homework. So now I am mad that she could not spend the day with me but was content spending it with her ex. I feel like im unjust though because she did actually agree to hang out yesterday afternoon (of which sucked because I just learned her ex was coming to town) and we hang out often while she does not get many chances to talk to her ex. I know she is trying to clear herself of the relationship but I just get so angry that it has to be at my expense. It also angers me that it has been an issue for about two years. I wish she could just get over him so we could focus on our relationship.

So my question is, am I justified in feeling jealousy, anger, and betrayal or should I be supportive?

And, how can I stop being angry and jealous about this so I can support her and make it easier for her?

t2_9r3le,1553740429.0,b6dcyq,t3_b6dcyq,5,"I'll try to keep it all as brief as I can while giving all the necessary details.

We live 1 hour away from each other, I'm starting my masters in August at my current university, she has been a nurse for about 2 years now having graduated from my university. Currently, we typically see each other 3-4 days a week, I go to her city and spend the night once, she comes here once, and one meet in the middle date night (aside from the odd weeks where our schedules are shit or we're our of town). We have been together about 2.5 or 3 years with a couple month break between, this was her having some needy issues, causing me to recluse and pull back, and we just had a rough patch. It's been worked through on both ends and we've both grown a ton since that period. Today we've been happily together for a year now since the rough patch and have had no real problems until now.

About 3 months ago discussions about moving in together at the end of our leases in July began, we both agreed that it would be great and we should move in together in August. We've browsed through stores, picked out some small stuff together, and she even got a dresser that she got a huge deal on and is refinishing it. However, about two weeks ago I sat down and seriously thought if I was ready for this step, and I started having doubts about it. Now to be clear, I have no doubts about our relationship, she is an amazing woman and I love her. My doubts are if I'm ready to move in together with someone, not with her specifically.

About two weeks ago I brought up my doubts and we had a very emotional discussion where she was basically devastated and crying. She said I had broken her trust, and yanked her security right out from under her. I emphasized multiple times it wasn't her in anyway, just that I wasn't sure if I was ready for this big step yet. We basically end by her convincing me I'm just scared and that I need to think about it more.

Fast forward, I go to visit her last Friday. Everything is okay in the beginning, just slightly awkward because we both know of the discussion that's coming. We kind of begin discussing it, and it comes out that I had emailed my current apartment complex before I brought up my concerns to her about any availability for August (it's a college apartment so they renew leases super early in like January/February for August, I didn't renew mine at the time because I was waiting to her back from grad school and kind of had a loose plan to live together). This basically devastated her again, and actually sent her into a suicidal state (she's struggled with depression and anxiety in the past, but this is the first episode like this in over a year). So I stay with her through it, try to comfort her, keep her from doing anything, and she eventually comes out of it. We get know where with the conversation, and basically end up watching a movie in bed before falling asleep together. The next morning, we pretty much have the same cyclic conversation, I tell her I don't think I'm ready to take this step right now, she tries to convince me it will be good and she thinks it's a mistake if we don't do this. I was supposed to leave that day, but she says she needs help and doesn't want to be alone that night, so I stay a second night with her. Sunday, I leave that afternoon and she's feeling better, but we're still no closer to figuring this out.

So now here I am. The basic cycle that our conversations always go in is this:

I don't think I'm ready to take this step right now, I think it's best if we wait a year.

She thinks we and I are ready, and she thinks it's a big mistake if we don't move in together in August. Her reasoning for wanting to move in together is that she is exhausted, has no time for herself, wants to see me everyday, and come home to me after a hard day at work (she has some pretty rough days sometimes).

She says she's not sure if she can handle another year of being an hour apart for the reasons above and her feeling like she is constantly going and never gets to relax or have a day off.

Now, I do understand where she's coming from. It does get tiring driving an hour both ways to see someone every week, and 30 minutes both ways to meet for a date night. She's a nurse, so she works 3 12 hour shifts a week, so she has 4 off days. Her shifts are exhausting, so understandably she usually is pretty exhausted for one or two of those days depending on if she worked three in a row or what. 2/3 of her 4 off days are spent with me, usually leaving her one or two days to herself.

So I get it, it gets old having to plan so much and commute to see each other. But I don't fully understand the exhausting part, she does have time and she does have days to herself. I've even said that I would do what she needed to make our current situation work for another year, whether that be driving to her more or whatever.

My concerns are these:

I'm not ready to give up my independent, living alone, following my schedule life. I'm 21 and I don't quite want to give up my independent life going into a master program yet. Not to mention my 5 minute commute will become a 30 minute one (though I tried to not let that influence my decision).

I do feel some pressure/coercion to do it. When I tell her I just don't feel ready right now, I'm met with her trying to convince me I am saying that I was completely ready for months up until 2 weeks ago. And although she's never directly said it, she's alluded at us not working out for another year like this. So I feel like I'm met with a move in or lose the love of my life situation, which I just don't feel is a healthy decision making scenario.

Aside from all of this, I just don't feel ready for this, which she hates hearing because I have trouble articulating why exactly I feel that way.

So I'm stuck. In an ideal world I would simply sign a lease at my current apartment for another year, keep our current situation, and then move in together next year when I feel more ready. And she would simply spend another year in her city. But in this world, if I make the decision to stay here for another year, I feel it's a huge risk for us, that she might realize she can't do another year apart and leave for her own sake. However, I feel like agreeing to move in on the basis that I lose her if I don't isn't a good decision either.

To make all of this worse, we've been talking about this for about 2 weeks (2 really shitty, stressful, long weeks), and now I basically have to tell my apartment complex tomorrow morning if I want the last available studio here or not.

I just need help. I can't lose her, she truly is the love of my life. I just don't feel ready to move in with someone yet, and the fact that I agreed to it before makes this a much messier situation (and yes I know I'm the asshole for that).

Am I just scared? Am I afraid of change? Should I just suck it up and move in to preserve our relationship? I'm at a loss. At this moment, she was taking some space for about a day, I told her I needed to tell my apartment something tomorrow morning. She said she didn't know what I wanted her to say, and said she was devastated and again she thought it was a huge mistake. I did get a ""love you"" and a ""I don't want to lose you either"", but she also doesn't think she can do another year apart. She told me to just make up my mind right then and there, and I said I was going to resign a lease here, and that I had zero doubts about our relationship, I just don't feel ready to move in together yet.

I just need some help, advice, anything. What do you think I should do?

\ \ \ \

TL;DR: Girlfriend of about 3 years and I agree to move in together about 2 months ago at the end of our leases in July, looked at apartments and stuff, two weeks ago I started having doubts about moving in together (not about her or our relationship). Brought up the concerns, she is devastated and is breaking down over it. I feel like if I don't move in together, I could lose her as she says she doesn't think she can do another year apart and thinks I'm making a huge mistake. If I do move in with her, I don't feel ready for it, and I don't think it's for the right reasons if I do it to not lose her. Also, I have to let my apartment complex know tomorrow morning if I plan to stay here. I just feel selfish and ignoring her wants/needs if I do what I want and stay here.

And reposting my concerns here for the TLDR: My concerns are these:

I'm not ready to give up my independent, living alone, following my schedule life. I'm 21 and I don't quite want to give up my independent life going into a master program yet. Not to mention my 5 minute commute will become a 30 minute one (though I tried to not let that influence my decision).

Aside from all of this, I just don't feel ready for this, which she hates hearing because I have trouble articulating why exactly I feel that way.

I should also add, I do think there are positives to moving in with her, I'm not completely against it. It would be so nice to not have to plan our week in advance and commute to see each other.

The first time we met outside of work (been on 6 dates or so) I found out we have a lot of similar interests and I thought that we have a good connection. But my concern is she is seeing another person casually which in my eyes is normal (but makes me a little insecure), but how she interacts with me in person vs over the phone or text has me a bit worried. She is very flirty in person and we get along very well but has told me she only dates older men 27+, and ignores text messages or take hours to respond to questions in which most answers are very generic. I'm not sure if she is uninterested in a relationship or if she is just flirting and letting me kiss her so that I continue to help her out and take her for dinner ect.

t2_36h4cn4p,1553739012.0,b6d4ld,t3_b6d4ld,2,"Hi all. 

I recently have had to let go of a few unhealthy friendships - long story short, a girl I was friends with began venting her suicidal and self-harming impulses to me and it developed to a point where she depended on me to talk her out of self-harm and suicide and give her relationship advice; she eventually started threatening to cut herself to make me do things and blamed her issues and actions on me and her anxiety/depression/abusive father. She would refuse to get actual help and blew up on me whenever I suggested it and flip the whole scenario on me not being good enough or not knowing her enough to see how her anxiety affects her daily life and so she obviously wouldn’t be able to speak to a ‘random stranger’ about her issues.

This is just one example of many others that I’ve had over the last two-three years since I became a teen - I’ve had friends try to trick me into telling them how they could get their hands on pills to overdose, ask me how to cut themselves, etc. I grew up in (and still am) a very strict household where I wouldn’t be allowed to go out unless it was for school and anything I did to irritate my mother would result in severe physical and verbal abuse. It’s better now, but before last year it was really really hard and I suffered from (and still am suffering, for some of them) depression, self-harm, anxiety and bulimia. I am now seeing a therapist and I have improved greatly since then, but I think that coupled with my parent’s divorce when I was 14 (They fought around me and I was dragged along to watch my father leave and never come back - on take your kid to work day of all times -  and my mother would vent to me over how terrible he was and how she was going to die) kinda traumatized me a bit. 

As a result of...**all of the above** I don’t have very good social skills and I was a huge pushover up until the past few months where I began getting more confident as I improved with therapy. The problem is that I really, really don’t know what to do or where to draw the line when my friends come to me and tell me about all their issues and such.

After the last relationship with a former friend ended (the one I mentioned in the first paragraph) I’ve become more...scared? To try and help people. 

I mean, I want to help them but in doing so I get a lot of anxiety and I have a huge fear of fucking up and making things worse. I still accept and let them vent, but doing so makes me feel really stressed and helpless while in the past I’ve just...gone numb and told them the right things. I don’t have that anymore. I feel like there’s something completely wrong with me. 

Whenever somebody approaches me with an issue, I really really want the conversation to end and I’ve broken down and told one of my friends about this and told them to get actual help - they stopped mentioning how much they want to die and they have a therapist that they consider to be useless but at the same time they also keep dropping how much they want to go back into the times where I would help them. 

I feel like I’m going insane or something and I don’t know if I’m just being a massive dick because everybody has to help their friends, right? 

But sometimes I wish I had friends who were just happy and talk to me about things that we both enjoy or they enjoy I don’t care just talk to me about *something* more often than they talk to me about how their life sucks and how much their mental illness is affecting them or how they cut themselves or how much they wanna die. 

And now I can’t tell when I’m supposed to help someone or what problems would be considered friend-worthy to listen to and what problems are considered to be therapist-worthy. 

Tl;dr: Due to issues with previous friendships and my upbringing I have very poor social skills and I’ve been used in place of a therapist to others before; how do I tell what problems are friendworthy and which ones are for therapists?

He told me from the beginning of the relationship so I knew the past. I never cared that he was still friends with her, I wasn’t bothered that he still talked to her. Didn’t think about it for years until something that happened recently. 

We were laying in bed, I was resting my head on his arm, he had me in a sort of relaxed headlock while I watched a video on my phone and he did his own thing on his phone. I could feel his arm muscles flexing/ moving because he was texting someone and it seemed like he was really typing something out so I asked who he was texting, to which he said nobody and that he was watching a Snapchat video.

 I turned to face him to see what he was watching, and saw him quickly close out of the chat with this girl, and he clicked one of the Snapchat feed videos. She immediately messaged him back, and he got extremely defensive when I jokingly said I thought you weren’t texting anyone. He kind of freaked out saying “He knew I would have an issue with him talking to her” even though, it’s never been an issue in our relationship, and he’s opened funny snaps from her in front of me, and I’ve seen her Snapchat name on the top of his messages tons of times before this and never once made comments about it or asked to see messages, or anything of the sort because I trust him.  He did not open the reply in front of me and turned away and opened the Snapchat for a brief moment before closing it.

Because of his knee jerk reaction to me asking why he didn’t just tell me he was texting someone, my brain has been absolutely wracked with anxiety that something more is going on, he got defensive immediately after, and asked me if I wanted to go through his phone or open the message she sent, but also added it would ruin our relationship and trust forever if I did. I absolutely don’t want to do that, and I’ve never gone through his things. I feel awkward opening his messages or getting into things on his computer even when he is asking me to do it for him.

The worst part is now I am starting to have a problem with the fact that he talks with her, and I hate that I am jealous or insecure now, or whatever these feelings are. I trusted him before, and now I have doubts, and I hate it. I hate it so much because he is so sweet and loving and I never thought for a second before this that he would be capable of cheating, but now that doubt and insecurity is rearing it’s ugly head. I wanted so badly in the moment to answer yes when he got upset and asked if I wanted to read through his messages, he has female friends he talks to regularly that I have absolutely no issues with, because I know they are friends but given his history with this girl and his reaction to the situation, my brain has just not let the situation fade, despite it being about a week.

 What can I do to get over this? Should I be listening to my gut instinct? I tried to bring it up with him the next day and ask more questions and he got extremely defensive again, saying things like “yep here we go, this is why I didn’t want you to see that I was talking to her.” When all I asked was something along the lines of “the only reason I’m upset is you basically tried to hide it, the way you immediately closed the conversation was so sketchy and if it was just a conversation with a friend why not just say just texting a friend?” I want to get over this so badly, but the doubts I have now about his relationship with her given the past  are overwhelming and I don’t know how to fix it.

We have been married only for a short time (4 months) , but it seems as though everything has turned into total crap. While we were dating, she moved into my house and we have lived together for over a year. During that time we've had multiple issues, but always worked to try and get them better. She has basically put up the idea of leaving during hardships, but actually never does it and ends up staying (which i think is a shit way to handle things). I'd like to preface that there is no concern at all of infidelity, and that the issues we have are not trust issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it seems like we are constantly in arguments with one another and the more its happening, the more I find myself caring less about getting into arguments. I was stupid in the beginning, and didn't really acknowledge her to one side of my family because i was in a 5 year relationship in which my ex cheated on me and I felt completely humiliated when I had to tell them. I kept my personal life pretty private from them and they finally found out about her when we got engaged due to social media. She refuses to meet them on the basis of me not making the efforts to acknowledge her existence during the time we were dating (i know i fucked up and cant do anything about that). On top of that, I was very hesitant to meet her family because of a language barrier, which eventually i got over after we were married. I now make the effort if she's going to see her family, for me to take part.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to having children, she wanted to have them this year. But i told her that because we were having issues that I dont care to bring a kid into this world if her and i arent doing great and feeling strong. I dont think it would be smart to have a kid if we are constantly fighting with one another. That isn't an atmosphere to promote a healthy minded kid. Part of me feels like if we keep at this, I would never want to have a kid with her which kind of pushes me to the point of why even be with her at that point.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately She's been getting more and more sensitive to the things i say, and despite making efforts to be nice to her and do things for her, we still end up arguing anyways over something else. It's to the point where we haven't even talked to each other for a week and i know that isn't healthy. I am feeling incredibly filled with doubt and hopelessness in becoming as strong as we used to be. I love her and care for her, but at the same time I'm afraid to keep failing. All i ever wanted was a solid life with her, but due to things in our relationship, its been harder and harder to get there. She came home today and told me she set up an appointment for counseling, but we ended up fighting even more and she left saying she was going to cancel the appointment and doesn't really care anymore and that she is not afraid of leaving or getting a divorce.  

&amp;#x200B;

It's clear that we are both unhappy, but we are married which makes it harder to let things go. For a good part of our relationship I have been completely in love with her and enjoyed being with her. I know she's a good woman and i love her, but loving someone does not mean that you are right to be together. I don't know what to do at this point, because i feel like there's a lot of shit going against us. I know that if i was single things would be a lot easier, but at the same time i would regret not being with her.

However, once the school day is over, I go home, do homework, play video games, surf the net, and go to sleep. That is my routine. I don't hang out with anyone outside of school. I don't go out much. I have siblings and a few cousins I spend time with sometimes. 

My Dad gives me a hard time about this. He asks me, ""Why do you never go outside? Why don't you talk or hang out with anyone from school? Do you have any friends at school?"" It's really annoying.

He literally tries to force me to go outside. He forces me to go on car rides with him to get me out of the house. He even tried to force me to go outside for 1 hour everyday, but eventually stopped because he saw it was making me miserable.

He has been doing this since I was a young child. He always tried to urge me to go outside and play with the other kids, and I never wanted to.

Why is my father making it seem like having no friends or much of a social life is such a terrible thing?

How he got here is a bit shrouded. He was in the French Foreign Legion for some number of years. He has the paperwork proving so. But he will absolutely not talk at all about his time there. The most history someone will get out of him is basically that he graduated high school in America, he was in the FFL, now he lives in Europe. Asking anything further about his time as a soldier will get you a flat ""I don't talk about it."" in a tone of voice that makes it clear he wants to drop the subject.

I've never been any sort of soldier, but I can certainly understand that things may happen that someone does not want to remember, and I am okay with that. There are things I'd probably rather not know anyway.

Whatever his story is, my husband is also the kindest, most gentle man I have ever known. I have been in a relationship with him for three years, and been married for six months.

The entire time we have been together, my family (primarily my father, mother, and sister) have pestered him for details of his past. Of course it is understandable that they would be curious as he does have a very interesting past, but my husband has made it clear time after time that he *does not talk* about his time in the FFL, and they do not leave it alone. 

I have asked them to drop it, but they claim they are curious and vaguely suspicious. My father, especially, has stated to the family more than once things along the lines of ""Well what should he have to hide so much?"". And he tends to imply that my husband must have done some kind of immoral or unethical things and should be viewed with suspicion.

My father brought it up quite loudly when I informed them that we intended to marry, and my dad went as far as to say my husband may be ""dangerous"". I was a bit offended, simply because my husband has shown me more kindness and touches me more gently than anyone I have known, and he has always been very kind and polite to my family.

They did drop it for a little while after our marriage, but even now when we visit my family will constantly throw proving questions at him trying to get him to share his past. I can tell it makes my husband not particularly want to visit them, but they refuse to stop asking, and my husband refuses to answer.

Is there something I can do to break the stalemate. I love my husband, I love my family, I want them to love each other, but it seems neither can get past this issue. Help?

I haven't tried to date or even talk to a girl in atleast 5 years maybe more. I am not super ugly or anything i just never had the time or found the proper woman. but I do have one big insecurity that draws me back in every relationship or friendship I have. I have missing front teeth and some very bad decayed teeth that are clearly not attractive in the least bit. I dont have insurance or money to have them fixed anytime soon. 


So my girlfriend is an ex from years ago that has recently sparked up some emotions and we have been trying to organize a trip for me to go see her, and I lose sleep every night trying to figure out if I should tell her before hand and make it awkward,  or tell her when I get there, or never talk about it at all and hope to god she just never notices or something. The last option clearly is what I want, but highly unlikely lol.


As kind of a side note, I have a few friends that tell me they had no idea about my teeth until I told them, one of which I worked side by side with for 6 months before I told him. I do have a beard mustache and long hair I keep to try and draw attention away from my mouth.

t2_13ltzh,1553667299.0,b60vgu,t3_b60vgu,29,"Brief background: we've been together going on 6 years and have a 1 y/o daughter together. Moved into our house 2 years ago. I discovered that he over reacted very early on as he had a tendency to storm out of rooms every time he didn't like something or something was annoying him (thankfully this stopped). We work different times (I work morning to mid afternoon, he works mid afternoon to late at night) so he looks after our daughter till he has to go to work - my mum comes at 11am to do the mid-afternoon babysitting duties and I'm home at 4:30pm to take over from there.

Recently I've found he has been making mountains out of mole hills; whenever he see's a dirty dish or bench top he states that he is ""always sick of this new home looking like a tip/garbage disposal"" even though the house is not that bad.. yes there is clutter here and there but it's not like it doesn't get cleared by the night. The floor is hardly dirty, sure it has a few specks of dirt here or there but I don't know of anyone that sweeps and mops every. single. day. What really grates on my nerves is the fact that on weekends, he will have breakfast (which I make) and once he is done, go sit in front of the TV and watch sports. If the mess really concerned him, wouldn't he feel obliged to clean it before taking part in relaxing/leisure activities?

Moving on to today.. Partner needs to do the household shopping/groceries so I had asked my mum to come over early because he didn't want to take our daughter grocery shopping. In all fairness, shes a toddler now and tantrums are almost a definite in the shops so to make things easier, this is what we do unless we can both go shopping together (which is rare). Anyway, typical mum who is just a all-round nice person (but also someone that gets offended easily) says yes and comes over at 9:30am. I should probably mention she walks 2hrs every morning and this has been something shes done for years, it helped her overcome depression back in 07. Mum exclaimed that she could just do her other half of the walk when she came over with our daughter in the pram, which i thought was nice as it gets our girl out of the house too. My partner told my mum to be home by 10am to put our daughter down and mum said she would. Partner comes back from grocery shopping at 10:20am to find that our daughter is still up and basically questions my mum about it. Turns out my mum went for a longer walk than expected, tried to put our daughter down at 10:15am but she just wouldn't go down, which is normal. Then my partner accuses her of lying. Mum just stays quiet and he noticed her moaping around. When he asks if shes ok, she goes on to say that she can't preform miracles etc etc.

My mum also mentioned she didn't want to tell him about our daughter not having a nap as she ""knew how he would react"". Isn't that a tell-all of the history of his reactions causing others mild anxiety ?

He then proceeds to call me to tell me they had a ""huge fight"" and when I find out why, I question if it was even necessary as toddlers naps can be all over the place, and we've made exceptions in the past? My mum also sent me a video when they were walking (pre-fight) and our daughter was very happy to be out on a stroll with grandma? So the whole thing then turns into an argument between myself and my partner and he questions why i'm not taking his side - because I don't agree with him?! and I think this is an over reaction.- I basically told him he needs to learn to chill out a bit when it comes to routines and naps and just be a bit more relaxed, and he exclaims that he finds it hard to change. Later sending me a message asking why it's always him that needs to change and no one else? If there is something I do that bothers him, i'd love to know but he never says anything.

He seems to order people around opposed to asking people nicely which also bothers me and is something I've spoken to him about. Example: my mum puts her shoes up on the treadmill because she doesn't want our toddler getting them, my partner will either ask her in a rude tone to move them, or pick them up and move them himself. He doesn't even use the treadmill, it's mine and I don't care if her shoes are up there? I think he is just doing this to cause drama or a reaction? or to assert dominance? i don't know!  I know no one is perfect but if something is bothering me, i'll say something. Am I asking for too much?

On a side note, he mentioned yesterday that my mum came over and would not stop talking and it was overwhelming for him. So he went to our room, closed the door and laid down on our bed 'for awhile' (his words) and chilled out there for peace and quiet.... while my mother looked after our daughter. This bothered me because he shouldn't be palming off his responsibilities as a father just because a grandparent is over. 

I reminded him that my mum doesn't need to be there every week day to look after our daughter and how lucky we are to not have to put her in daycare but I don't think he fully appreciates the things other do for him. My parents are also looking after her for the whole weekend as we are going away...

I'm at a point where I don't feel like he jumps at any opportunity he see's for the sake of an argument and I can say anything anymore, he takes offence to everything (when I'm not even having a go at him). I try keep the house as clean as possible (we have a toddler FFS, it's not going to be perfect, display-home quality like he expects) but nothing is ever good enough. On the weekends I am doing 90% of the parenting unless I ask him to assist with something. I don't know if i'm being insensitive or what.

DON'T GET ME WRONG... For the most part, his track record with me signifies he is a good partner and he is a good father too - if he wasn't, I wouldn't have been with him for 6 years and wouldn't have had a child with him... But I think he likes to take advantage of those around him, picks fights, makes mountains out of molehills and over reacts all the time... I don't know what to do anymore.

So, a bit of backstory, i have a coworker, T (24F) who this is about. i’ve known her since October when she got hired but her boyfriend had worked at our job for about 3 years and was a really hard worker and a great friend. T and I grew close and we talk a lot. i knew her and her bf were both on probation from when they each got caught with meth, on separate occasions. they have both been on probation for the last 3 years. 

T’s boyfriend recently got off probation, and unfortunately, he did overdose and pass almost a month ago. it hurt us all at work, incredibly bad. the night we all found out, we were all just crying and hugging at work. i’ve never lost anyone in my life to drugs like this so this is a whole new ball field for me. 

now, because of her bf overdosing, we all know how that T has also been using again. i had suspected as much when i noticed her skin getting bad, but i didn’t say anything. a week later was when her boyfriend passed so i’m paying even more attention. 

her whole life has flipped upside down. they were living with another coworker of ours, he kicked her out and changed the locks after the body was picked up. she’s now staying with her mom but her mom isn’t very stable either and also suffers from some sort of substance abuse, although not nearly as hardcore as T’s. she came back to work about a week after his passing, but she told me later it was because her mom said she had to in order to keep staying there. 

now, i’ve seen T a lot since his passing. i took her last week to get a tattoo in memory of him, and i even saw her outside of work in the last 24 hours. 

she came to work today, and looked like shit tbh. i can see her skin starting to break out again. she looked awful, her skin is looking yellow, and it didn’t look like that previously. i’m incredibly worried. this poor soul has lost so much the last month, i’m worried she may be a little more reckless with her using, IF she is. she previously told me she has been clean since his passing, but seeing her today scares me to death. she has as much support as she needs at work, she is adored by plenty. but i don’t know what to say. or do, or how to act. and i know there probably isn’t anything i can do or say to make her change her habits, but what can i do now to make sure she doesn’t do anything too bad? 

again, this is my first time dealing with this kind of situation. i was too afraid to speak up last time and i regret it because it may have saved my friends life. the least i could do now is everything in my power to help her save herself

Hey y'all. I am a 21F college student. I am studying biology and am pre-med on my way to medical school. I met a guy (lets call him A) on tinder within in the past 2 months. We have hung out twice and talk frequently. We get along really well and there is just some spark between us; we both have agreed that conversation flows really well between us, we are both comfortable around one another already, we both hold a great deal of affection for one another. A is one of the most genuine, caring, understanding, sweet, and honest guys I've met. A is already willing to put in so much effort into our relationship. I've been able to be 100% honest with him in everything, and he has already been there for me and comforted me more than I could have ever expected. He really is a fantastic guy.

However, I am not all that physically attracted to him. I actually find A rather ugly. I hate to say this, but I am having a hard time getting over the lack of attraction that I have for him. A is very far away from the physical characteristics I find attractive. Also, he does not plan on going to college any further than a certificate and A never plans on owning a house, both of which are on my to-do list. Part of what I am looking for in a partner is someone who also has pursued an obtained a degree (ideally within my own profession as a doctor). The main reasons are I want to be able to talk to someone about my work, to bounce ideas off of, and so that I am not the sole moneymaker in my family, and there are two comparable sources of income.

I have honestly no idea what to do. Emotionally I am attached to A. Physically and life-plan attraction does not line up for me. I feel shallow wanting to end the relationship based on lack of attraction and the difference in life plan. Is it shallow? What would you do?

t2_8ko3pf,1553689823.0,b63w6e,t3_b63w6e,15,"I met this girl in highschool and we slowly became really close and great friends. Her senior year she even dated another guy, but that didn’t stop us from being close and just being friends. I knew I liked her from the start, but since she was in a relationship there was nothing I could really do about that at the time.

I moved out of state far away for college while she stayed in state and we kind of lost touch for the 1st semester of freshman year. Then over thanksgiving break everything changed when she invited me to visit her. I eventually asked her out and we were now doing a long distance relationship. It was decent for 2 years and I’ll admit I wasn’t the best boyfrriens at times. Part of it was that I wanted some space and didn’t want to non stop snapchat, text and facetime like she did. This started causing a rift in the relationship and she dumped me before junior year.

The break up was extreme for me as I had multiple breakdowns and couldn’t really control myself as I was constantly looking for answers to find closure and happiness. The breakup however didn’t stop us from being best friends and talking everyday. There were times where I would ask her if we could try again and I got denied everytime. It upset me, but I had to accept it since I didn’t want to ruin the friendship that we had. I was losing a lot of weight and at one point had lost 25 pounds and was too skinny. When second semester came stuff started to get a little better, I was hitting the gym again and started to put on healthy weight and then I just woke up one day, 8 months after being dumped, not giving a single fuck about what happened as I decided this was not how I wanted to live anymore. We still talked everyday, but my responses became more direct with less thought put into them and I was also not responding right away. From my side of things I didn’t really care since she had told me multiple times she didn’t want to get back together so I decided I didn’t want to just be there for her whenever she needed me as I was tired of being her boyfriend without the title. This made her get her feelings back for me and our conversations definetly got more couple like. This caused her to spend the rest of junior and senior year thinking that we were back together, the problem with that though is she turned me down everytime I asked and never told me she wanted to get back together so the entire time I was under the impression that we were just good friends hooking up since that is what was happeneing from the start.

Graduation comes along and she moves to a new city while I move home. I can tell things are off the moment she moves as she has become cold with the responses to me. She straight up tells me that shes breaking up with me, but we can still talk everyday after so that we don’t have to go completely cold turkey. This pissed me off mainly because we weren’t even dating for the past 2 years, she turned me down every single time, if she had just communicated to me that she wanted to get back together everything would have been different. I got blocked on everything and I slowly started to feel better until I saw that she was now calling me, this happened after 3 weeks of her blocking me. I picked up and she was sobbing about how she hated her friends, apologized to me about treating me like shit, hated the city she lived in, said I taught her what unconditional love is and that she used me like a crutch throughout college. I calmed her down and just told her everything was ok and that I’d always be here for her even when were pissed at each other. A couple days go by and I reach out to see how she was doing and she says shes good and then proceeds to block me again and her reasoning was that even though she needed me at the time that didn’t mean she wanted to be friends going forward. Now I really felt like garbage and worthless. I felt like I had been treated like a doormat/her therapist since I spent all that time caring so much about her only to be tossed aside the moment she moved. I was filled with so many mixed emotions and now I wanted her back again, it felt like all of the progress I made of being over her the last 2 years in college was gone. The past 8 months have felt like a rollar coaster, I have my good weeks, but I also have my bad days and when those days come it is bad, I can’t sleep, eat, or really do anything I wanted to do other than be curled up on the couch. I’m constantly looking for answers to why we couldn’t work, why she won’t give it a chance, why do I love someone who couldn’t care less about me, how someone that I talked to everyday for 6 years could toss me out of their life like I was nothing. It just feels like everything that led to the outcome was toxic since I feel like I had been used and now I’m trying to find that spot of not giving a fuck that I once found. I just want to move on with my life, but I just can’t. I don’t know how.

My question: does it matter which hot-recepticles I wire the two hot wires into since I cannot readily identify them? Articles like [this](https://www.how-to-wire-it.com/wire-a-dryer-cord.html) say it doesn't matter... But several other videos and articles I have perused insinuate it does.

Any insight into either identifying the red and black hot wires and/or determining whether the outlet wiring order matters is greatly appreciated!",DIY,[Help] Installing new 3 prong dryer outlet in old home; How do I determine difference between unlabelled hot wires?

As for the issue, I latched onto the cleat but for some reason the shelf is titled down. Due to the positioning it’s clear there is no way it can hold nearly enough weight. I’m not sure if adding the extra screws through the top, which will level the unit will still provide enough support.

The shelf itself is made of 3/4 ply so it’s got some weight. The TV is probably 75 LBs. 

The cleat is screwed in with 10 2.75 in screws. Will another handful of screws (that level the unit) be enough support for that weight?

Does it make more sense to make legs? The legs would be a little awkward due to the radiator. May have to use 3 instead of 4 legs? Not sure if that would work.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everybody! So I've been dabbling in woodworking with hand tools and my wife wants me to build this for our wall. It will be 2 4x8 sheets of 1/2"" plywood, hung horizontally on my wall, with the lower sheet being slightly shorter than 4ft and everything faced/covered with barn wood/reclaimed wood that my wife loves to hide any lines/faces. I'm debating on a few methods of hanging these, the first being a french cleat for both with a spacer (screwed into studs), but I'll probably end up lag bolting/screwing them into the studs. This will hold roughly the same amount of shelves seen, and my 65"" TV (mounted using t-nuts from the back to bolt too). I kind of want to make sure/see if there is an easier or more appropriate method to this or if the lag screws will be solid enough. 99% sure that's fine.

&amp;#x200B;

The real meat of the question is the shelves and what-not. I have a 16 month old daughter who likes to climb, and I know that even with proper supervision there WILL be a time that she's hiking herself up this like a ladder. It's inevitable, she's an evil genius already. My original idea was to do 1/2"" ply boxes (think floating shelves) for all the horizontal and veriticals with headers to support them (2x2 and 1x2 or something) or pocket screwed into the backboard every 6 inches or so. I just worry about those coming loose due to leverage and I'm not sure how big the ledgers would need to be or the best joinery to use either. I think I've way over analyzed this, but now I'm thinking of running 2x8 or 2x6 ledgers on the long horizontals and then using similar wood to support between them like a wall and lag bolting those into place from the backside. Or using a french cleat for everything on the face so i can take it off easily in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

so the TL;DR is I've read myself into circles on the best way to attach the vertical and horizontal shelves onto the plywood so that it will be sturdy enough for possible/eventual child mounting.

Soooo the plaster board on this wall got wet from either condensation on the cast iron pipe or a leak a while back. Either way it had to come down to repair. As I'm going to put up the new board I noticed the pipe sticks out at least a half inch past the studs. There was no sign of this with the old wall up and I tried putting a board across it and pushed it to the studs and of course it cracked. How could they have possibly put board and plaster on there without it showing? How do I go about getting around this? There is also a door on this wall so just simply sistering the studs and building out the wall doesn't really work without building out the door jam. Plus there was already a wall there!! I shouldn't have to!!

Applied stain generously with paper towel quickly and as evenly as I could, wiped off vigorously (with clean, dry paper towels) basically as soon as I was done appling...  I'd say it set on the board about 1 minute (I was told this was how long the cabinet maker had it sit).

We got in a huge fight last week and he sent me flowers and followed up with a call saying “there’s no way I’m losing you as a friend”. I feel like it’s a mix of emotions and very contradicting actions. I want to completely move on, but I feel a part holding on to what could be. It’s unhealthy and I know that. My question is….can he seriously just be interested in a friendship? I just don’t see myself going to the lengths (non-negotiable in my relationships, hanging out constantly, sending flowers after a huge fight, constantly being his soundboard) for just a friendship.? I feel like if my ex pushed me away and I wasn’t interested in developing a relationship past a friendship I wouldn’t try so hard.

t2_1tpo1ogz,1553710686.0,b67o83,t3_b67o83,7,"Hello Reddit,

Sorry in advance for bad grammar, since English isn't my first language.

I  have a bit of a crush on a girl problem, I don't really know where to  Post this, but this subreddit seem suitable. To my story:

Edit:  I don't know if this is important, but I'm 16 and I'm just asuming she  is around the same age from how she looks and which notes she is  learning from for School

I've  been using public transport for a very long time now, always taking the  same train, at almost the same time, and always drive the same  direction. Not often did I see any girl, that I find attractive....

&amp;#x200B;

Until a few Weeks ago. Now I never really had expreince with a lot of  girls let alone hit on girls and definitely never a girl that I havn't  see through certain activities, e.g. School, Sports, voluntary Fire  Dept. so this is a bit of a first timer for me. Now back to the story,  the first time I saw her was on my ride home, and the whole time I had  to control myself to not look at her the whole time/too often. I hoped  that she has to get out at the same stop as me, which she did and still  does, and conclusively she has to live in the same Town as I do (Around  17k inhabitants).

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't know anything about her but I'd love to  get to know her more because I think I really have a crush on her. I  always got into the rear end of the train, until I noticed that she gets  into the train in the middle part, so I moved my ""get in"" position  slowly over days nearer to her. Now I really didn't get near her and I  don't know if I should try to even sit next/opposite to her or keep a  bit of a distance like I'm doing it now. Yesterday I don't know if we  had a moment or not, but we looked at each other straight into the eyes  for like 4 sec (meanwhile me smiling). Today I had the feeling that if I  come to close to her that I'd come off as a creep so I intentionally  only ""almost"" missed the train, so I would be more in the back, since  the train platform entrance is at the back, and not facing her direction  when chosing my seat.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure If I should just talk to her, I  really want to but I don't know how and when. Should I do it in the **morning or in the afternoon**  (I see her on the trip to and back for a certain time. I get off the  train one station earlier than her, but meet her at that Station on the  way back, I don't know why she's at that one on the way back), and **how**  I should approach her, because I also definitely do not have a  conversation starter. Thatswhy I decided to come to you guys for help.  Already Thank you in advance, sinve this is in germany it could be that  the peoples attitude is different, so if your a German just tell me, but  all Advice is appreciated and welcome.

My BF played with her and another female friend by using remote control sex toy during university class without any romantic feeling. 
He and the one friend were controlling it and another one was sitting a little bit far. He saw her trembling as he controlled the level of the toy, he even controlled it when she talked to their professor. And he felt “being dominant is my joy” through this experience.

He says it meant nothing to both of them. But is this not super weird in western world? 

I asked her name and he didn’t wanna tell it cuz it can cause drama. But he told me anyway and I found out that one of his best friends that he still keeps in touch with.

I felt how can he be her friend still after this...? He says, she has good heart and she is a nice person. That’s why, one day, he wants me to meet her.

I feel it was so stupid if I saw her without knowing anything. (I’ve never met her yet) Now I know that she is the woman that he sexually played with. How can I talk to her normally and smile at her...

For me, this is not friendship anymore. It is the line that he shouldn’t have crossed. 

I explained all my feelings and he understood my side. He said he would suffer if he was in my position and wouldn’t be able to ok to meet the friend.

After this talk, I am still having so much trouble to understand “It is okay to play with that kind of toy between friends”...
Can anyone give me advice to make me digest this whole situation easier...?

**The context**

Last year, I (F, 24) dated two friends (M, 23 a.k.a. ""Barry, and M, 25 a.k.a. ""Justin"") who were both aware I was seeing the other. I broke up with ""Justin"" in November for many reasons (compatability, maturity, etc.), but mostly because I realized my feelings for ""Barry"" were deeper, and that it was unfair to prolong things with ""Justin"" any longer. It hurt me to break up with ""Justin,"" because he's a great guy, incredibly smart, attractive, and shares many of my interests. ""Justin"" and I are part of a sports club that meets for two seasons out of the year--I introduced him to it, and he loves it as much as I do.

When we broke up in November, I wanted to end things as amicably as possible so that there'd be a chance to stay friends afterwards--especially as neither of us has any intention of leaving our sports club. So, I wrote him a letter explaining that he was wonderful, but that I couldn't see him romantically anymore because my feelings for ""Barry"" had grown. I also took ""Justin's"" call to talk about the situation the day after he received the letter.

**The developments**

Ever since the call, we'd been perfectly civil to one another--""Justin"" even hugged me goodbye at the last club event of the season (which happened to be my birthday). Later, a mutual friend told me that ""Justin"" had helped make the birthday cake, so I wrote him a simple thank you email for helping make my birthday cake. He responded angrily to the thank you, asking me to not contact him again unless it was on ""official club business."" I've honored his wishes; but yesterday (a week after his outburst), ""Justin"" has emailed wanting to meet to discuss the breakup and get ""closure.""

**The problem**

I’m unsure what ""Justin"" is looking for closure-wise since I did my best to give him closure right after the breakup. I'm a little worried that he might try to ruin my reputation in the club if I don't handle this well, seeing as ""Justin"" has taken things spitefully before (I'm better in writing than face-to-face). Do you have any ideas on what he might want? What lingering questions have plagued you after a breakup? How should I respond in a way that lets me be his friend again?

t2_3hq740nh,1553717072.0,b68zx6,t3_b68zx6,18,"Hi guys. First of all, sorry for my poor English, hope you understand me (not my native language). Basically, I need to talk with someone about something that happened to me. Recently I borrowed a phone to my girlfriend. When she gave me the phone back I couldn't stop noticing she left her Facebook account logged in and I couldn't prevent myself to read her messages. I know I shouldn't, but I did it. It was stronger than me.

Before that, let me do a brief summary about our relationship. We started our relationship about 10 years ago. We broke up about 5 years ago (for during almost 2 years) and during that time we couldn't stop dating each other, almost like the couple we were before. Then we got back together, until now. Right now, we are in a very difficult situation because of me. We should start be living together and getting married, but we can't because I can't figure my professional stuff (I've not concluded my degree and I should start a new one very soon in a city different the one my girlfriend lives in).

So, back to the present. I saw some messages. I saw messages from the time we broke up. Remember, we broke up but we kept being together. On those messages, there is a guy flirting with her and hitting up on her all the time. The conversation goes for months. He invites her for coffee several times and call her pretty names. He calls on her phone many times. She obviously is enjoying the compliments and the attention, which makes her not want to stop receiving those messages. She never talked with me about those messages and she always refered to the guy who sends them like 'a friend' she was talking with just because he was interested in a friend of my girlfriend (which he really was, but not for much time - until he started to draw is attention to my girlfriend).

Then they stop talking for years. However, they started to talk again a few weeks ago (obviously during a time we were back together). These messages are different, less flirty, but I read some things there that I didn't like at all and I can't stop myself from thinking about them all the time. Things like:- my girlfriend admitting she never accepted the coffee requests just because of her other friend (the one the guy supposedly was interested in),- my girlfriend inviting him for lunch, just as friends (I guess). However, she says the lunch would be weird (which I don't get why), so maybe they should start by going on a coffee,- the guy saying, after my girlfriend says she had regrets related to him, he wants to be with her right now (even though he too has a girlfriend),- my girlfriend saying If she didn't a boyfriend right now, she would be interested in him,- my girlfriend saying that one day she is available, she will go pick him up at work.

So, I didn't like to read these things. But I don't know what to do about this. As I said before, our relationship is in a very difficult situation because of me. She has been very comprehensive about my college / professional stuff, but the truth is our relationship is 'delayed'. I don't want to admit I read the messages, but I think I should have know the things they talked while we were on a break and, mainly, about the most recent ones. Also, I don't want to be starting a fight, because I'm in a position I can't demand many things (many people in her position had already broke up with me - so I guess she really likes me). Also, I believe she never actually cheated on me. And also, I like her a lot. Really a lot. She is the one.

Help guys. What do I do? What do I think about this?

t2_hmfqojc,1553708610.0,b678mq,t3_b678mq,13," 

To bracket this: we are about to hit our fifth year of our relationship. We have lived together for four years. We know each other extremely well. We are generally very open with each other, even if it means some hurt feelings sometimes. Generally those incidents result in better understanding and solved issues, but there is one area that I cannot make a breakthrough with:

Cleanliness.

She is highly impulsive, meaning she has a lot of \*stuff\* because she does that. No problem with that, it's what she likes. This results in a lot of clutter, but again, it's not a huge problem for me. I'm fine with clutter. The issue starts with the neglect. Her office (luckily a separate room from mine) is intolerably filthy. Today, I pulled three sandwich containers with month-old rotting food from under the garbage under her chair. Not a square inch of her desktop is visible - and not from her business stuff, but from dirty dishes, wrappers, dirty clothes, several old towels, and empty packaging. She recently had to buy new headphones because apparently the old ones stopped working - because she just drops them on the floor and rolls over them with her chair without a second thought. I found four pairs of destroyed headphones shoved in a drawer. I keep things sometimes like that for extra wiring for my projects, but I can promise that's not what she's doing.

The same happens in our bedroom - the dresser she uses is covered in useless junk/garbage, and her \*entire\* half of the bedroom is filled with dirty clothes and random things she once brought in but never picked up again. The kitchen can look the same way, as she has never once since moving in washed the counters or floors (even wiping up dropped food).

I have to explain this because it's not just some disorganization and clutter. It's filth. It's the kind of thing that, when some of it is uncovered, can be smelt around the house. 90% of it would be solved if she put packaging in the garbage/recycling when she opened them.

Any attempt I've ever made to address this has been met with a turnaround to me insulting her personality. Her family (father and stepmother) don't have this issue but raised her in an extremely sheltered and ""single child"" way. Her room in her family home looked the same when I first met her. It's a problem that would relieve a lot of the tension we ever have together, and because of a disorder I have it stresses me out to be in a disorganized environment. I do \*not\* bring this fact up with her (though she is aware) and it would only deepen her interpretation as me insulting her personally rather than trying to help her. She is extremely busy managing her business, so it's always hard to find a time that's safe to talk about it without her declaring that it's her down time.

I need help. I love my girlfriend dearly. We have had an incredible relationship, but as my life starts to stabilize with my graduation and looming career, I need to know that I can be happy in the space we share without the endless mental stress induced by uncleanliness. There's nothing else off about her at all. I need to be able to deal with this, but I don't know how.

Two weeks ago (ish), her ex boyfriend and her were alone at work (they work together) and he kissed her. This is not what she wanted and she pushed her away. I trust that, and she was really upset about it all. 


Fast forward to now, her, her ex and I are on a school trip for 3 weeks. On the first day I noticed they were talking a lot and seemed to be great friends again. I confronted her about it with the conclusion she had not fully moved on from him yet, so I ""ended it.""


I really didn't want to do that, but I also didn't want to put myself through that. Later that evening, we made up but didn't really solve any issue. 


In the following days, we've talked extensively a few times about it. She values him as a friend, but feels she has moved on enough to be with someone else. They still talk a lot presently. 


I'm just really having a hard time getting over my jealousy. I've told her about how I feel, obviously I'm not going to tell her to stop talking to him. 


How can I help myself and relieve myself of some of the anxiety? And how can I just stop being so clingy?

So I told him about it which made him bring back old feelings and he lost his trust in me and ultimately led to our breakup.

3 months ago I met a girl on tinder and we started dating. We live around an hour apart, I drive 99% of the time, which is around 10-15 euros every time we meet, and we meet 3 times a week.

She really loves to go out to restaurant's and to the cinema, she also told me she finds it attractive if the guy can pay, the stupid guy that I was I even paid most of the time, which then was like 60€ every time we met. I was just too crazy about her, I don't know what it was but I've never felt like this for a woman before.

Basically just thoughts that haven't happened yet but my mind is telling me will happen and that causes me to freak out and to bring this stuff up with him instantly to get reassurance.

I know he's sick of it, he's been dealing with this for a while and I'm trying my best to prevent it but keeping these thoughts inside or reassuring myself just isn't helping me, I need to discuss these things with him, he usually does talk me down from every single one, until I bring it up again to make sure what I remembered was discussed from the conversation was right. Anyway my point is, that we fight a lot over the idea of something and not the reality of it and I feel like it's pushing him further away from me and yet I can't quite help to change it. Every single day me and him are so good, and I mean so good. We're the happiest we can be and then one thought will pop-up and will ruin everything, I feel like I just ruined my anniversary and today again I brought something instantly and now our day feels ruined.

I can get past these other thoughts for a while and it's because he can really help me get by them, even if we cry and yell, we manage to get past it and we both know that these thoughts won't draw us apart and he loves me regardless of this happening. But this time it was different, because it's something that does happen and isn't just a bad thought or idea of mine, and not even with just him but with everyone, I know he's seen other attractive people and that bothers me to no end knowing that he may find someone other than me attractive.

He thinks a lot differently than I do, or maybe I just don't understand it completely but he claims he understands what makes someone attractive, like if he saw a model on a magazine (male or female) he could see why they may be attractive and why people find them attractive but that doesn't mean he is attracted to them and would want to be with them. He believes he can understand what makes someone attractive without being attracted to them, is anyone like this or understand this too?

Everyone notices attractive people when they're walking in the street regardless of age/sex/etc. It bothers me to no end though that my boyfriend and I do it. Everyone does it but it's so bothersome to me. Does this bother no one else? It kills me every time I think about him even looking at someone else. I am very insecure. But regardless I feel like it should bother everyone in a relationship. Am I alone here? The act itself is just gross and disgusting. The fact that it's human nature makes it even more disgusting to me and the fact that we can't help it makes it even worse. Please tell me I'm not the only one who has a very big issue with this. I just need reassurance or anything here that I'm not alone, or that what I'm thinking isn't entirely reality, or maybe that I'm thinking too much perhaps, or should be thinking about this a different way.

Please just give me advice on how to make these thoughts go away, advice about the last bad thought I had and how I can change to make this stop for my boyfriend. Thank you.

It seemed as if she wanted to be friends with me too but my anxiety made it from us talking everyday, to only sometimes, to not at all. For some reason this is when I developed a crush on her. And it just made me angry that I had a lot of missed opportunities. She got a boyfriend at the end of the year, and that was the end of that. 

I pretty much completely forgot about her, I got a job in which I would have to interact with the public over the summer which helped my social anxiety a good amount. But now recently I have started to have that obsession again over these missed opportunities where I sort of beat myself up.

Our relationship was magic. He loved my friends and family, they loved him. He brought out different sides of me and really helped me grow into the person I was meant to be. We traveled to multiple states together. After college, he wanted to go to grad school, and one of his choices was out of state (like it would take a whole day to drive there). I'm kind of a free spirit and usually I don't follow people around, but I felt strong for him. I've never had a connection with anyone like I've had with him. This guy gets me in ways no one else can. I didn't want to lose him and I felt like long distance would be a struggle. I actually told him I wanted to go with him to grad school, which is a HUGE deal for me because I've grown up in the same city my whole life. I said I would get a job there and we'd move in together, I even opened up to him about the possibility of going further in our relationship (getting engaged). 

I think that freaked him out. He sat me down one day and basically told me he's thought about it and he said he didn't know if he wanted marriage, or kids for that matter. I was hurt, because marriage and children is something that I want so badly. I didn't want it right at that moment, but I definitely wanted it to happen later on down the road. I didn't want to change him, so we broke it off amicably. Maybe I should have fought harder, I don't know. It sucked to throw so much away, but also what else can you do? 

Fast forward two years later, I've had some boyfriends but none like him. We reconnected through text message on a random day and picked up on our usual banter without a hitch. A few months later we started to Skype (about once a week) and he jokes with the idea of me coming to visit. I joke back and say ""Well what if I did?"" And before I knew it I was buying plane tickets to see him this summer.

We're really excited to see each other, and he's ready to show me around and introduce me to his friends (who already know about me, apparently). I'm going to be staying with him in his apartment for 5 days. 

We've talked about our life goals and what we separately want for the future. He now tells me that he's more open to the idea of marriage and kids (he says ""it just depends on the person""). We've even talked about our breakup and how we felt about it. We've basically told each other everything that's happened in this two-year gap (relationships, hardships, funny stories, you name it) and I still think he's awesome. I told him that he's still special and there's no one like him, he said the same about me.

I told my friends and family about the visit and they're surprisingly excited. Of course, they're asking me what this means and honestly I have no clue. I know we're most likely going to get intimate (TMI maybe but hey) but as far as what happens after that I really don't know. He has teased the fact that I can come up there during the winter, because I've never seen real snow, but that's about it.

I have so many questions. Can we get serious after all the history? Can we even do long distance? How can I tell what he wants? There's so many factors, and usually when it gets that complicated I would just walk away, but this time I think I want to fight for it (that is, if he wants the same thing).

I honestly feel crazy for even considering this. I thought the feelings were buried and gone but, as you can see, they aren't. 

Oh! Forgot to mention he has two more years of schooling and I'm currently in a program in my state that requires me to stay for two more years, so moving to him right now isn't an option. 

Help?

TL;DR I had an on and off relationship with my ex for 3 years. We broke up ultimately because we wanted different things. He moved away. We reconnected 2 years later and decided I should come visit this summer. His view on certain things we disagreed on has changed.

t2_anse5h,1553740917.0,b6dftj,t3_b6dftj,3,"Baited: To be lured into a one of the following situations: Exposes a person for something they may have wanted to keep hidden, or makes them do or say something stupid. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or in my words but less general: your SO mentions something, doesn’t discuss it, you get anxious and it leads to you to do something that wasn’t planned.In the end, your SO did that to preserve their ego, or to apparently look good, by making you do something really “worse” than what they did to you. Thus making you look wrong when actually before that you were right, your SO’s bait provoked you to be worse in comparison. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here’s what basically happened: I snooped at my ex belongings (on the 4th month, I had my reasons, but it doesn’t make it right), found out she was passioned about another person (she asked if he would come to have sex with her, he said he would not, this question happened in the first few weeks we were together, and we had already talked about being exclusive), so I decided by myself what to do. 1. Say nothing (but my anxiety wouldn’t let this happen). 2. Say nothing and pretend everything was fine. 3. Break up with her and tell no reasons why. 4. Break up with her if I told her and things didn’t go well (and don't play with the information I had). 5. Be mature and tell her what I found out (and don't play with the information I had), trying to understand and also forgive her and expecting her to forgive me (I never was judgemental in front of her), so the relationship could go on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I firstly chose the plan number 4 and it drifted to plan number 5, but she said regretted nothing what she did (including her accepting to show me her phone and me finding out a sexting session with a random guy), she got all defensive and I forgave her. A week later she mentions that some of my clothes were in her house and that we should think about our relationship. I panick, she doesn’t want to talk about it and 3 days later I send her a message breaking up with her saying that I wanted a certainty (when this happened my vacations had just started so I spent those 3 whole days thinking about what happened, at the same night she mentioned those things, I sent her a few hours later a thank you message for the time we were together and saying sorry for some things I did, my intention was to prove to her that she was important to me). 

&amp;#x200B;

So after my breaking up message, we met and she mentioned open relationship (she knew I wouldn’t accept it and I didn’t even tell my opinion) and a break on our relationship, and dumb me waited 2 weeks for her breaking up with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

That’s it. I picked the plan number 5 and her the plan number 3. I explained everything to her, while I got no explanations back. She only said she already decided when I first told her but waited for my finals to end, but was probably meant to damage control, the cause was probably my breaking up message, and of course her inability to discuss what happened, even though I never was judgemental or demanded explanations. My ex later said she would expect me to say nothing (that means following the plan 1 or 2).

&amp;#x200B;

What are your opinions? Which plan would be the best? Which one would you choose?   


Do you have similar stories to tell? Or other baited/lured stuff that you had while in a relationship?

t2_tpudi,1553643758.0,b5x4a3,t3_b5x4a3,28,"Ahh..where to begin. My girlfriend and I have been seeing each other since Highschool, 14. We've grown together, became best mates, pretty much spent our teens together but she is extremely insecure and jealous.

&amp;#x200B;

**Context:**

* I'm not really 'allowed' to have female friends, can't chat to them etc. Extremely jealous over it no matter how innocent my intentions are.
* She pulls me up for looking around my environment, argues that I check other girls out etc.
* Tries to sus out my phone thinking I'm cheating or something all the time
* Tries to stop me from going to social events if she isn't present and other females are.
* She can do whatever she likes, I'm cool with that. I have complete trust. She has lots of guy friends, been to many parties without me in the past but now there's this double standard.
* ***Lead up to catalyst:*** There was a discussion of an after party involving my friend group and some of their partners, that she couldn't attend due to the day. I'm not allowed to go either because she's not there, big argument ensued over that.

&amp;#x200B;

**Story**

Last night was a major catalyst, we went to a formal party with a group of my friends and which some had partners. There were females there as many guys brought dates. I would constantly receive bumps from my girlfriend telling me not to look, or stop checking some girl out, which in all honesty I wasn't. At one point she even accused me of looking at someone's breasts. What the fuck?

&amp;#x200B;

She made the night completely about herself, kept telling me to be more affectionate in public because all the other couples are. 'Show that you love me.' Again, what the fuck? I was being social, talking to everyone and listening to the speaker.

&amp;#x200B;

Time came to dance, all my mates ran off onto the dance floor, it looked like a lot of fun. She expected me to sit there and wait for her while she chatted to another mates partner. The other girls partner then ran off to dance and I went to follow him seeing as he had a partner and I thought I could do the same....I was greeted by a rude finger sign and I think she said fuck you. I just walked away, I overheard her say ""hang on can't fucking trust him to go dance"" again, what the actual fuck?

&amp;#x200B;

Argument proceeded after I heard that comment, I said ""you didn't see all the other SO's freak out when their partners went to dance."" Replied back with ""Fuck you for comparing me to other people!"" Did she not just compare me to other couples? She even compared me with a couple at the table stating I wasn't open enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't spoken to her since. This has been going on for way too long now and I've tried communicating about it with her, hence the argument on the after party prior to last night.

&amp;#x200B;

**Am I right to be pissed off reddit? Should I break up with her?**

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

* Girlfriend is really insecure and jealous
* Accuses me of looking at other females
* In large social settings makes things all about her
* Can't go to parties or talk to females without her

t2_3dimt9il,1553704514.0,b66do9,t3_b66do9,6,"My girlfriend (26) and I (M 30) have been together now for just over 2 years. Started out really well, we worked together in the same office for a fair bit until I quit October 2017, and she did too very recently. 

Around the time we started dating she was in the middle of a complicated relationship with her then boyfriend, and said she'd have to speak to him about us before she could commit to anything. I agreed. For a brief time she never did bring it up with him, and when she did it didn't go too well, as expected. He freaked out, fought with her, cried and left saying he didn't want to be in touch at all (she was hoping for them to remain friends as they've been part of the same group since high school). 

Over the course of the year every time she and I fought she'd tell me she'd have to end the relationship because the ex was trying to create problems between her and her friends. One time after a fight she went and had lunch with him. Obviously they ended up hanging together multiple times at parties, which very consciously I wasn't called to because she wanted to avert any awkward situation that might arise. She wouldn't answer my calls around him, and basically pretend like I didn't exist. She and I would often end up fighting over this weird situation, but I went with it anyway mostly to stop the fights over anything else. And she insisted that I had trust issues if these things bothered me. 

Basically we've now reached a point where we fight almost nonstop. I've stopped asking whether she's still in touch with the ex, even though I presume she is (and every time he's not coming to a party at her friends' I get invited to it). In January she met up with one of her other high school guy friends, and then for the next four days was totally freaking out about whether she could've contracted herpes because she shared a drink with him (she cried, begged me to stay overnight at hers, etc). She got tests done, and it wasn't herpes. 

I have major communication issues as well. Most times I don't talk about things even when they make me feel bad (no large friend circle, either). I try meditation or running whenever anxious, and sometimes it helps. But sometimes when she's irritated/ anxious and trying to get me to talk to her about something I snap, and this (obviously) doesn't sit well with her, so the fights just keep stretching out. 

She doesn't get along with most of my friends. My best friend she gets along with, though, (F, 35) and my friend is a hopeless romantic and tells me love needs to be unconditional so I need to love my gf irrespective of how she is. This friend is divorced with a 9 year old son, and is almost like a mother to me. My other female friends don't get along with my gf, and I have a feeling she gets extremely insecure everytime I'm with a group of people she hasn't hung out with (she does too, and I've stopped caring about it over time). 

Don't know if it matters, but we're both from broken families (we both live with our moms, dads live away). We've both consider therapy every time we make up after a fight but neither follows through. Long story short, don't know if there's any point in keeping on working on this. If it's been one fight every 3-4 days these past two years (with the threat of other guys looming), maybe it'll be like this forever? Each time I bring up issues, she cries, says they're all in my head, that she doesn't know what I'm talking about. When I say we should work on us, she says she can't believe I've treated her so badly, so she isn't sure. And when I say let's break up, she says we never want to work on anything. 

Really don't know what to do, and the fights just go on and on.

t2_13mj2f,1553694445.0,b64owo,t3_b64owo,10,"I 25M went on a third date with a 24F on Monday. I’ve been on a lot of first dates, probably a couple dozen at this point. I’ve had a 3+ year long relationship and several shorter ones in-between. I can say at this stage, right now, this girl is my favorite of any girl I’ve ever been out with. 

Problem is, things ended up in the bedroom on this date and for the life of me I simply COULD NOT perform. So, I got her off via oral and afterward simply said it was nerves getting to me. She was very understanding, but slipped in a “we’ll try again next time” as we got redressed. 

Now, I can’t stop thinking about it. She’s acted pretty normal towards me, adding me on social media and texting me, so it seems not to be a big deal to her but I’m still stressed out about this. I’m worried it will happen again and I’ll blow my chances with a really awesome girl. 

The problem has happened once or twice in the past the first time I’ve been with someone, and it always seems to work the second time, but this is the first time I’d feel really upset if it happened again.

t2_13r27w,1553687927.0,b63l7h,t3_b63l7h,4,"Hello. My girlfriend and I have been dating for 9 months now and I've never been happier. I'm a trans man so I've always been insecure about dating, but she's amazing and respects me even though she had only been with cis guys and didn't know much about trans stuff. 

But we argue a lot about her ex. She had dated him for a year or so and broke up on March 2018 because he also went away to another city to study and the LDR wasn't working. Three months after the breakup she met me and we slowly began dating. In the beginning she wouldn't stop talking about him, she even discussed about exes w/ my sister one time in front of me, but I didn't care too much since we were getting to know each other. But his shadow always seem to linger over our relationship. Her friends and family still talks (badly) about him but I wish this could stop. When my girlfriend talks about her past, she always mention him and it seems like he's been a huge part of her life. We were watching a k-drama yesterday via Rabbit and she was constantly saying how she was struggling 2 years ago watching this romantic drama because she had a crush on her ex at that time. This was just one episode.

Two months ago she deleted all her photos on Instagram. I thought she had deleted them because she needed some time to herself, she wasn't feeling so well at that time so I left it alone. There were pics of her and one with me and I loved them. But I only came to know the REAL reason she had done that yesterday. She had deleted them because her ex was constantly liking her pics and she told me she didn't want him meddling in our lives. At first I left it alone, because we had already argued yesterday and I didn't want to argue about her ex AGAIN. But then, thinking better, I don't think it's right to let him ""win"". And I also don't understand why doesn't she block or delete him from there.

We already fought a lot because of this, I think 70% of our fights have to do with him directly or indirectly. I have told her countless times that I just want his shadow to disappear because he always seem to be in the middle of our relationship. I know she would never get back with him because she made it clear she loves me and I'm much better than him. I trust her, but sometimes she just doesn't seem to have gotten over her ex. Should I talk to her about the Instagram episode or leave it alone? I don't wanna start an unnecessary argument.

The dilemma is of course, my relationship. I love this guy so much and I am willing to stay longer, but only on the condition that he would try out my home country for a year, after we spend 2 more years where we are so he can finish studying.

*Side note: My lover told me that we can only be officially together when we both have stable jobs. We're currently working on that and focusing on our studies.*

A week ago I told her a particularly sexist statement, and she got triggered by it. She then told her mom about it later on, and her mom decided that my lover should stop talking to me and forget about me.

The thing is, I regret saying that to her, and began to question myself whether I am a sexist, misogynistic person or not. I don't want to be sexist in any way, *especially* in a time when gender equality is an issue. We talked about that exchange later, and she trusts that I can get rid of my sexist attitude. We still love each other, and we really wanted to meet with one another. Another thing is that this whole exchange happened a week ago.

As a result, she's always offline, and talks to me rarely. What long threads of conversations we shared now became sparse exchanges of greetings and ""i love you's"" to each other. I began to doubt her love for me, even though she told me that even if she doesn't seem like she loves me, she still loves me dearly. I was in contact with her friend so I can keep tabs on her, and I expressed my doubts to this friend. (Said friend later told my lover about my doubts)

Last night, I learnt from her friend about her mom's statement. My lover's mom now also forbids me from meeting her. She doesn't like it, because she still loves me and she can't handle the stress that this situation brings.

She also doesn't like the fact that I doubted her love, and feels sorry that she made me feel that way. She thinks that she hurt(s) me, and wants to break up with me. I convinced her not to, because it would be too painful for us to break up while there is still love between us. She thanked me for fighting for her, and I thanked her for believing in me.

Currently, she's offline for almost the whole day until late afternoon, when she barely messages me. It worries me - I'm confident that we'll end up together in the very end, but she's pessimistic about the future.

Right now, I'm at a loss on what to do. I don't know how to convince her family that I am worthy for her, and I don't want her to feel pain, heartbreak, and suffering from not being able to talk to me freely anymore. I'm willing to wait it out, and focus on other things, like my studies and self development, but I don't know about her. She still doubts that this relationship will last.

I can't imagine a future without her. I'm not a particularly good-looking guy, and I'm a passive guy and she's a proactive, tough, tomboyish girl, whose traits are complementary to mine. I've decided that I'll commit to her, and I've set plans for the future. I *genuinely* want to care for her, to nurture her, to give her love. As a guy who finds solace in helping other people, she gives a lot of meaning to my life.

I know that we should focus more on our studies and our future, but I can't help but worry and stress over this predicament. I actively try to help her out with her studies (I also manage mine averagely well; I still belong in the Dean's list), but given this situation, it's going to be hard.

t2_465q6h7,1553617298.0,b5rqua,t3_b5rqua,5,"Hi everybody. I've looked through old posts on the topic of shopsmiths before and the general consensus seems to be that because of the high cost ($1200+) just for the motor, and non specialized nature of the machine, people don't like them much. 

I'd like to argue for them however on a couple points. 

First the cost: I got my Shopsmith mk5  motor on eBay for $395. This came with a fully functional motor from the 80s, the full stand in nearly perfect condition, and the disc sanding attachment. For this initial investment I was able to buy a $250 planer, $230 jointer, $200 bandsaw, $75 drill press (cost of the chuck), and a $75 lathe (see drill press). They are all extremely heavy duty and reliable because of the power of the motor, and individual pieces of similar quality would have run me upwards of $5000 total. 

Second, the space: the Shopsmith and all my attachments fit in a tiny corner of a garage. I have effectively stored the majority of a woodshop in &lt;15 square feet. 

I get that not everyone can get these kind of prices but I think it's a really neat piece of equipment, and if you get the motor for a good price, the rest kind of pays for itself. The only major caveat is you really need to plan ahead because otherwise it's a lot of repeating unnecessary tasks. That's just my 2 cents though and I'd be happy to hear some of your opinions.

‘Wouldn’t want you to lump out again!’


‘You need the exercise’ 


‘you don’t need the dessert’ 


‘Ever going to make it to the gym or are you going to keep lying to yourself’ 



These digs about my body combined with how often he raves about other girls’ being so hot and perfect bodies has really taken a toll on my self esteem. He’ll constantly talk about how attractive other women are whether they’re on TV, Instagram or if they’re mutual friends of ours. 


I know that he has issues with his weight fluctuating too, more excessively than mine, with changes between 10+ kgs over the past two years but I know it’s sensitive for him, so I never make comments about his body unless it’s a compliment like 


‘You look really fit!’ 


‘You look so handsome right now’


I never comment about other guys or how they look, I never compare him to them or say that I’d rather be with someone that looks a certain way. 


I’ve explained to him again and again, that if he wants to motivate me for gym, I’d rather hear positive encouragement when I’ve been active rather than nagging when I’m not.

It is a weird situation and I don't know exactly where I stand with her or if I have already ruined any potential for a possible relationship. A little info about the girl, she is usually reserved and does not have many male friends but she seems to enjoy my company and has told me that she does so on several occasions. I know I shouldn't really listen to what females say but she has told me many things that point to the direction of her liking me such as 'I like talking to you', 'you brighten my day', 'i miss you', 'you're my favorite', 'i wish you could see what i see', 'i admire you', etc. I think she likes me since she is touchy with me and has given me hugs out of nowhere and put her arm around me but then I think she is in general a touchy-feely person. The thing is that she is always there for me and has helped me on several occasions with stressful situations which feels great as it can feel like I have no one at times but it also plays with my head as I don't know what to think about her. She has shown signs of jealousy when I talk to other women but they are at a lesser degree now. It sucks because I like this girl a whole lot but I feel that I am slowly ruining it when I say self-deprecating things about myself which she hates and calls me out on. What should I do?

t2_33685t2w,1553718128.0,b697t2,t3_b697t2,1,"As previously stated, I started dating this girl as we both enjoyed our conversations and we were both into each other (apparently). We went out a couple of times and things were really going somewhere, until the following school period started, as we both became suddenly distant. I must confess I wasn’t doing much at first to get her attention, as I thought she would take the initiative sometime, but, as it wasn’t the case, I proceeded to invite her out yet again. 

However, problems started arising as I overheard a friend’s conversation where he said that the girl wasn’t really into me, which led me to start doubting what was really going on; weren’t things as well as I thought? Did she misinterpreted my intentions? I have been dragging this doubts since then, not allowing me to act confidently with her and, in consequence, distancing myself from her. We still texted each other, but the doubt was still haunting me.  Additionally, to make things worse, another friend gossiped me that, after speaking with the girl, she allegedly said that she was expecting me to make a move, but even if I did, she didn’t want things to go somewhere, which increased the gap between her and me, leading me to believe things were truly over, and treating her indifferently. Also, I started believing I wasn’t good enough.

However, in recent weeks we started texting to each other as spontaneously as before, making me wonder if there was still a chance. And we agreed to meet the following weekend, just like before yet I feel like I’m getting mixed signals here; if you aren’t interested in a guy (that you know he is into you), why would you go out with him, why would you still answer his messages and send him others? Shouldn’t you just kindly ignore him or be direct and tell him things are done? 

By and large, should I still pursue her, hoping things eventually get somewhere, or should I just put things to rest? 

(Additionally, maybe I should clear that I am truly inexperienced in this dating thing, having only one girlfriend in all the time I’ve spend in this earth, and meeting just a couple of potential mates that ultimately led to nothing.)

I, (20m) have been in a relationship with (20f) for about a year now. Things have been going great. However now the butterflies have subsided as I’ve always been told they would and I feel comfortable around her. I like spending time with her still and I always do things like buy her some candy just because, or absentmindedly kiss her cheek or forehead just because. We have great chemistry and a good sex life. I tell her I love her all the time and she always says it back. I feel at peace when we hang out. From the outside looking in you wouldn’t even suspect somethings up. And I’m not even sure somethings up. Things are perfect. But I’m an over thinker, and as butterflies die down I start to associate that with the infamous “falling out of love”. I’ve never been in a relationship this long and have enjoyed every minute of it up to this point. The thought of it ending makes me feel real bad. I’ve also never experienced “falling out of love” either. Is it normal to have these worries first time around? Am I overreacting? 

I just feel like who I was before the relationship. Whenever we hang out I feel amazing and whenever we aren’t hanging out I no longer have this strong urge to be by her side at all times. I think that’s what really scares me. Is that normal? I still enjoy being by her side mind you but it’s no longer a necessity to hang out 3 or 4 times a week.

I’ve been with my fiancé for nearly three years and I just found out 2 days ago that she cheated on me. We were at a beer festival at one of the local bars having what I thought was a great time. Around 2PM she says she needs to use the restroom and she goes off by herself. After about 10-15 minutes of her being gone, I start wondering what might have happened and look begin looking for her. Looked over the whole bar, couldn’t find her. Texted and called her numerous time with no response. After a while of this, I think maybe she’s just gone back home. I get an Uber back to the house and she’s not there. I call her mom and sister and they’ve not heard from her either. At this point I’m starting to actually get concerned something more sinister has happened. The neighbors haven’t seen her or heard from her either. I call her and text her over and over with no response. I wait a few hours and go back to the bar to look for her again, she’s not there. Parents and sister still haven’t heard from her either. Finally at 10 PM she calls me. I am so relieved when I see her name pop up on my phone. So I answer and ask if she’s okay and what she’s been doing. She says she’s fine and she’s been “sleeping.” I literally don’t even think anything about it at this point because I’m so happy she’s okay. She tells me she’s on the way home and that we need to talk. When she gets home she says that she isn’t happy and doesn’t think she wants to get married anymore. I don’t remember exactly what I said, but I was very angry. We start yelling at each other and she just says she’s going to sleep over at the neighbors house. The neighbor is 25 year old girl that my fiancé is friends with so I don’t even think anything of it. She leaves and I just think this has been a fight and maybe we got a little too drunk, and tomorrow everything will be fine. I don’t hear from her or see her again until 10AM the following morning. Granted I had tried calling and texting earlier in the morning. She starts saying the same thing as the night before, she’s not happy with me, she’s not in love with me and she doesn’t want to get married. She also keeps saying how I don’t deserve to be treated like this. That phrase right there sent something off in my head because she has never said anything like that ever in our previous three years together. So I ask her if she cheated on me and she said yes. Now she says, it’s never happened before and it was last night after she left the house again (obviously she went and stayed at this dudes house) I guess trying to justify it?  Anyways, I packed a bag and took my dogs and came to my parents house. We have been living in North Carolina since August. We moved there to live in a big city away from both of our families (I’m from KY and she’s from St.Louis). Shes never ever said anything about not wanting to get married prior to this so it kind of blind sided me. She has mentioned that she kind of feels isolated because she’s so far from her family and we don’t know many people in our new city, but never questioned our relationship to me. To make matters worse, we just signed a new lease in a city about an hour north of where we live right now to be closer to her work. I also have accepted a new job in the new city which I am supposed to start in late April. We have to be out of our current place by April 14th.  I have no desire to be in the new city, or even North Carolina anymore for that matter. I’m really hoping that she will take the new lease so we don’t have to find another person to take it over.

I know about the drug use and don’t mind but the issue is that he did not clean up when he was done. I only noticed as I was packing up my laptop to leave for a lecture and was lucky enough to spot a considerable amount of the drug on the laptop. If I hadn’t noticed, I would have gone around campus all day and at best - embarrassed myself or at worst - gotten into legal trouble. 

We communicate about this stuff regularly. I tell him I need help with the little things around the house if he’s going to be here so much. His defense is that he would never do these “little things” if he wasn’t with me. So every time he cleans up after himself at my place or gets napkins at a restaurant he’s basically doing me a favor. 

He does have very messy roommates so we rarely spend time at his place so I sympathize with him on that point. I just feel like he uses me for my clean space/ stocked fridge without realizing it.

I’m wondering if I need to compromise here and either ignore his messes (without getting into legal trouble) and accept that he has somewhat unmanaged ADHD, or double down and insist that he takes an active role in the mental labor of our day to day lives. Also - I know we are young. We are as mature as possible for our age and I’m looking for advice before we take the next step in the next few years. 

Thanks!

t2_84zyh,1553694891.0,b64rtd,t3_b64rtd,11,"I (M25) recently met a girl (24) who climbs at the same climbing gym as me and I think we’ve really hit it off (I say “I think” because I was diagnosed with mild Asperger’s a year and a half ago which was a broadside hit to my confidence in my ability to read body language and social cues). We’ve climbed 1-3 times a week for about 4 weeks now, and as soon as we met I knew I had major feelings for her. 

After the second time we climbed I found out through conversation that she has a boyfriend. So I took the L and started the process of moving on. 

We continued to meet up to climb and as we did so, it kept resetting the process: we’d climb, I’d get major feelings, we wouldn’t climb for a couple days, I’d feel like I had moved on, we’d climb again, repeat. Part of the reason it resets is because every time we climb, I’m picking up on a vibe of extreme interest on her part: giving each other light shit if we bail on a climb or otherwise screw up, making a joke while the other is climbing that makes the other have to bail because they’re laughing, jokingly pushing me or tapping my shoulder to emphasize a point, offering to adjust my harness without me asking just because I said it was being a pain in the ass. This past weekend she asked me to take pictures for social media as she climbed, I sat down in a chair to review them with her and she stood behind me and leaned on my shoulder as she was reviewing them.

The reason I doubt these signals is because texting has pretty dry and basically just used to plan climbing days (although one time after I told her I’d be gone for a few days on vacation she said “How am I supposed to climb without my partner 😢”). I know that some people are just naturally flirty and don’t want to read into something any meaning that isn’t there, but I also don’t want to be missing blindingly obvious signals.

About a week and half ago, it came out that she’s not happy with her relationship (growing stale, doesn’t feel special, etc.). I expressed sympathy for the situation and related it to a recent long term relationship of mine that had ended. I didn’t pry so as not to come across as eager about this situation. We talked about it briefly, and then continued to climb.

This past weekend, we met up again and I asked her “How’s life?” and she said “It sucks.” I asked why and she said “Considering breaking up with my boyfriend.” We then talked for about 5-10 minutes about the situation as she opened up about it (part of this included her saying she didn’t really care if the relationship ended). Note that this is the same day that she adjusted my harness of her own accord and leaned on my shoulder to review the pics.

Now we come to what I need advice on: I feel like I’ve been in a whirlwind for the past month and I just want it to stop. I want clarity on the situation and don’t know if I should tell her about the vibes I’ve been picking up on and ask if there’s anything there. But I’m willing to endure the whirlwind and sit on this feeling if it’s my best chance at making something happen with her down the line.

My dilemma is this: ask what’s up and risk losing a friend and climbing buddy because of residual awkwardness after the fact, or wait and see what happens and possibly miss the train. The LAST thing I want to do is interfere in a relationship, but this feeling is getting to be a lot to handle.

So I repeat my question from the title: what do?

TL;DR: I like a girl, I’m picking up on vibes from her, but she’s in a relationship she’s expressed dissatisfaction with and is considering ending it. The feeling is getting unbearable and I don’t know if I should just sit on this uncertainty or ask her straight up if the vibes I’m picking up on are real.",relationships,"I’m picking up on some major vibes from a girl I like, she’s in a relationship but has expressed dissatisfaction with it and is considering ending it. What do?"
t2_xlzle,1553687825.0,b63knc,t3_b63knc,2,"TL;DR at bottom

Let's start off with some backstory. Me and my boyfriend have been dating for nearly a year now and I can honestly say that most of it has been happy. However, admittedly by him, these last few months have been rocky due to him unable to fully commit to the relationship. I have been patient with him and recently we had a breakthrough in which I truly saw progress and things start to turn for the better.

My boyfriend doesn't think too highly of himself in our relationship. Anything that upsets me he automatically takes as his fault. No matter how much I explain to him that my issues are my issues and he's the best part of my life, he still insists that anyone is more worthy of the love I give.

I'm not a mentally well person. I have a ton of anxiety and suffer from depression. I do my best to try and keep that from him because I can understand how exhausting it is to be a mental outlet for someone. However, when things get difficult with my home life(a different story), I try and go to him for some form of comfort because I truly need it in those instances. For the most part he does great, just being there and listening, show love and support. However, he some how turns it on himself as for being the reason why I'm going through this or somehow it's amplified since he isn't sure what to do.

---
Now on to what happened:
Last Sunday was a really rough day for me at home. I was mentally done and really needed my anchor. I had sent him a really long message on discord explaining how I'm.at my breaking point with everything that's going on, admitting that I felt I was dragging him and everyone down with the baggage I seem to carry. How I just want everyone to be happy but I feel as if I do the exact opposite.

He took it initially as a breakup message and agreed with it probably being the best since he hasn't been the best to me. I quickly went into panic mode and try to reassure him, that it wasn't at all a breakup, but that I felt as if my life wasn't currently going anywhere and how I seem to make more people upset than happy. I don't typically talk about my depression so openly with him like that, but I truly needed him at that moment.

This lead to me sobbing and just pouring my heart out to my boyfriend about how things are currently, just how bad my thoughts were, but most importantly how he has been my ray of sunshine throughout this. I wanted to make sure he understood that I'm not looking for him to ""fix me"" or to solve all my issues. I wanted to make sure he knew just how important he was to me and how I felt I wasn't being my best with talking about such things because I understand the mental exhaustion with dealing with those such as myself. It didn't work.

After we talked a bit more that night, he reassured me that everything was going to be fine and ushered me to sleep since I have grown tired. I went to bed feeling a bit better, but still obviously upset.

Monday morning comes and all my messages became ignored. I tried not to think much of it since he has a tendency to sleep in. However, when the time came for him to start his stream(he's fulltime), it became apparent he was avoiding me. I didn't want to start issues, especially publicly, so I let it slide. I then messaged him after stream with my usual ""I hope your stream went well."" Nothing.

Tuesday is now here and I still haven't heard anything. He was going to fly to Boston for Pax and I was growing more anxious. I finally bit the bullet and messaged him before his flight saying, ""I can understand if you don't want to talk to me anymore atm, but please understand I love you very much and I hope you have a fun trip. Please have a safe flight and try not to drink too much.""

I finally got a response. Short, simple. He said, ""It's not that I don't want to talk now or ever again, I just think we need some time to breathe. Relax, everything will be okay ❤️""

I'll admit that I initially read the message wrong and took it as him not wanting to talk ever again. I sent him a short burst of messages explaining that I was sorry for being a negative Nancy and I'll give him space, but to please not to say such things since atm it was too much to bear.

I don't want to ruin his trip for him. I'm happy he's having a fun time with friends and fans, getting out and doing things he would typically avoid doing if given the chance. But I don't like living in this limbo of not knowing where we stand. I really needed him Sunday night and I can't help but feel as if I ruined everything. I have never felt so hurt and alone, issues at home not getting better. I simply needed my boyfriend and some reassurance but got a ""break"" instead. At this point in time I don't know what to do with myself, avoiding twitter, discord, and twitch so I don't see him having the time of his life as I sit crying all day. He doesn't come back until the 31st.

Do I consider things over or am I being over dramatic and over thinking things?

TL;DR: Poured my heart out to my boyfriend Sunday night about my insecurities due to issues at home. He felt he was at fault and called for a break and now wont message me.

My (29f) husband (30m) will be graduating this May with his associates degree and while talking about whether or not he wants to walk at graduation he revealed that he is embarrassed to only be getting his AAS. He comes from a family of lawyers, accountants, etc., where all of his immediate family members have masters degrees or higher so to him the AAS is no better than a HS diploma. This breaks my heart because he has worked so hard for this degree and he deserves to feel proud of what he's achieved. He is such an amazing guy who worked in law enforcement for 10 years (a high stress job he hated) so that we could afford for me to complete my bachelors and now pursue my masters.

On top of attending school full time and getting his degree in only 18 months, he has also taken care of our two children while I work and he feels like a bum who stayed home and only got his associates. I had no idea he felt so down about himself and not proud at all about what he has accomplished.

Is there anything I can say or do to help show him how much he really has accomplished and to show him how proud I am?

t2_1bicxc,1553714090.0,b68dll,t3_b68dll,6,"I have just met a new friend, and I am extremely puzzled by his behavior. He thinks that I have wronged him, despite knowing him for less than an hour, but I feel that is very unfair, as he has never listen to my side of the argument, and I believe that he uses this as an excuse to get closer to my best friend. My best friend happens to be one of the most popular kids in school and is very charming and charismatic.

The new guy tries to punish me by separating me from my best friend. He does this by sitting between my best friend and me while in class and is always interrupting me when I am talking to my best friend. He tried to block me from my best friend in every single class, but my best friend put a stop to it. However, he still persists in trying to sit between my best friend and me. In the end, we allowed him to do it for the first class everyday for the rest of the week.

When I refuse to tolerate his actions, he stares at me like he wants to kill me. He reads my text messages over my back, probably scared that my best friend and I are communicating with one another. He went through my test papers without my permission. Most likely to compare results with us. He looked so intense and fierce while doing so. He follows us everywhere, even in the toilet. He will stand right next to my best friend at the urinals. I voiced my opposition to how he treats us and he rebuffed me, saying that I am the one who is over-reacting and that his actions are perfectly normal. He even blames me and my best friend for not including him more in our lives.

It is frustrating that he is trying to negotiate the terms of our friendship, insisting that my best friend make time specifically for him without me around. As he feels, that I get to spend so much time with my best friend and it is only fair that he deserves some of that. I feel that he is emotionally blackmailing me and my best friend, that if we refuse his demands, he will continue trying to separate us.

We gave in to his demands, but his actions of trying to separate us persists. We tried confronting him and making a stand against him, but it only made things worse. He got so angry and tried to challenge us. For example, while I was walking with my best friend down the hallway chatting, he ran towards us, push me aside and squeezed right between us. He kept interrupting every single one of our conversations.

He is getting more desperate, he appears more tense and very nervous. He says that I am jealous that he is getting closer to my best friend. This couldn't be further from the truth, my best friend hates him and limits their interactions to school only. My best friend refuses to have anything to do with him outside of school. The problem here is that my best friend is so charismatic that even a casual conversation with him feels like a lifelong connection had been struck.

I am really at my wits ends trying to deal with this guy. I don't know how to deal with him rationally. I hate cutting people out from my life as I feel that it is a hurtful thing to do. I want to give him a chance, but I don't know how to proceed on trying to get him to be nicer to us and treat us with mutual respect.

Started dating when I finished grad school, she was finishing undergrad. First year: absolute honeymoon. She is sweet, funny, confident, and beautiful. Did long distance for a while but spent a good deal of time together. She was bartending, I spent basically the whole first year of us dating figuring out my next step after grad school.

Second year, I got a job a few hours away from her--she messed up her classes and stayed an extra yearish--she continued to bartend. During this time, she tells me that she's applying for grad school in an area she's interested in. I'm ecstatic. Her major is liberal arts and she had no idea what she wanted to do so I'm very happy for her. Months pass, I ask her about the applications. She then tells me: ""oh I only applied to two schools and they have a 5% acceptance rate, so I don't think I want to do that anymore."" I lost my mind. I was so upset. I broke up with her for a little over a month. I had a medical emergency and we get back together. She finishes school and continues to bartend. She has no loans, I have many--low 6 figs.

Third year, she graduates, moves in with me. I was on a 2 year contract for my job so I only had a year left when she moved in. We were on the same page that we'd probably move after my contract was up. So, when she moved in, I told her that I didn't care if she bartended, waited tables, gathered trash, whatever, as long as she worked and also made an effort to find a ""real"" job. I know this makes me a bit of an asshole, but I have been straight up with her since the beginning: ""I started dating a bartender when I met you but I'm not going to marry a bartender. I want you to pick a career and be my equal(ish) partner."" Equal not necessarily in money making, but in general ambition and life goals. I have communicated this directly to her and I don't mean that statement to be patronizing. I recognize that it probably is, but I have many, many friends in the service industry, and I genuinely don't mean it in a disrespectful manner.

When she moved in, she made no attempt to get a ""real"" job. She barely attempted to get a restaurant job, despite several years of experience. She applied to places saying ""I don't want to work nights or weekends because my boyfriend works 8-5 and I want to spend time with him."" She then proceeds to get no call backs. I let her do her own thing--no pressure. I offer advice, offer to set her up with people--she says no.

Two months go by, and after a long conversation where I tell her she needs to ""get a job, any job,"" she tells me she thinks it might be because she told them she wouldn't work nights or weekends. I FLIP. I can't believe how stupid that was to this day. She is not stupid. I immediately call a friend, she gets hired at a nice restaurant the next day. She has worked there ever since and done a great job. In fact, they just promoted her from bartender to a managerial role recently.

But she never actually applied for any job outside the service industry, and she didn't apply for anything once she started working. Fucking nothing.

Also, up to a month ago, she didn't have any credit cards. I sat her down two years ago--credit is important, what if your car breaks down and you have to buy another? Your credit score will matter. She agrees and promises to get a credit card. I put no pressure on her, sent her a bunch of literature on no fee, starter cards. She tells me she's in the process of getting one for almost two years.

Finally I make an ultimatum: get a fucking card or I'm breaking up with you. You have no preparedness for the real world. I can't deal with that. She says she understands. She self admittedly has anxiety and ""financial anxiety"" because her father ran up credit cards during her parents' divorce. I'm understanding, to a point. I'm like, ""you have no credit history, they're going to give you $100. You won't be able to run up debt."" My ultimatum date passes, no card--""it's on the way.""

Meanwhile, her car breaks down. In my head I'm like, ""SEE!! THIS IS WHY THIS SHIT IS IMPORTANT!"" To her, I'm gentle and helpful--i had just bought a car and had done a ton of research. She refuses my help or even to really listen and then her dad bails her out by giving her a family car for cash (way undervalue). Lucky her. I then beg her to research car insurance rates here because they fluctuate greatly in the state. She refuses, just gets the brand she used to have. She pays $400-500 more per yr than I do and I had a brand new car.

More months pass, no credit card. I sit down and ask her about the card. She says she's still deciding. I lose my mind again. I ask her for her SSN and she starts crying--breaking down. Says she's already applied to all of them I gave her and they denied her and she doesn't want to get rejection again. She eventually gives me her SSN and I apply for a card. She's immediately accepted for a low limit no fee card. I'm like seriously wtf you need therapy. She agrees. She has not scheduled any therapy appointments or seen anyone for anxiety.

Another thing, she is athletic and loves basketball. She is awesome at it and I love watching her play. But she doesn't work out or play unless it's pre organized! She hasn't worked out beyond a hike or two in at least four months. I go to the gym regularly (2-3/wk) and continue to play a sport (2-3/wk).

Last thing, she's an EXCELLENT partner. We both cook, clean, organize, take on extra duties depending on the other's feelings/workload. She communicates with me pretty well and we don't really have many serious arguments. The only ones I can think of are the grad school one, credit cards ones, and a few on specific shitshow nights of my drinking over the past few years. Never longlasting anger, violence, etc. No verbal abuse or shouting, whatsoever. We also like each other's friends, families, etc.

I'm just sitting here, with a busy and upward trajectory white collar career, and I feel like she doesn't know how to adult--she's never gotten a job that she wasn't set up for/got the same day, she doesn't listen to me financially when I'm trying to help her, and she still has no idea what credit is. Meanwhile, her family helps her out a ton.

I'm conflicted. Sometimes I think my issues with her stem from my jealousy over her lifestyle. Graduate with no loans. Fucking hell, right? Broken car? No problem, here's one. Wanna do bull shit fun jobs to pay the bills? Go for it, you have no obligations. Meanwhile, I'm in an intense career with 6 figs in loans from paying my way through school--(living costs will get you even with scholarships).

It just drives me INSANE how much she admires her hippy/rich friends. Oooh look they're in Hawaii on a flower farm isn't that so cool? ""How much are they making?"" Room &amp; board plus $10,000. ""Even if I didn't go to grad school, I literally could not afford to do that. My loans, alone, cost more than $10,000. That is rich white people bull shit."" --This particular exchange did not happen until I had heard about them in Hawaii many, many times, and lost my temper in a moment of madness. I apologized shortly after and communicated my feelings properly.

It's just these things just add up, in my mind, to childishness/being spoiled/having NO ambition. I feel like I have to do a heavy majority of the adulting, and it's wearing on me. I can do this by myself and it'd be easier, you know? Thank you.

Tl;dr: I'm sitting here, about to finish my work contract, and I just want to leave her behind after three years because it's like she wants a father not a boyfriend.

So I (17M) have recently started a relationship with a co worker of mine (18F) and we were very happy for the first two weeks. We were seeing each other close to everyday and talked to each other constantly everyday and everything was going great.

I was then invited to her cousins birthday party (I am also a co worker and friend of her cousin) were I got to meet her family. I personally thought it went very well and I especially got on well with her younger siblings which she seemed to like as she personally gets on very well and is very close with them. But then later I was invited to spend the night at hers, and we got intimate that night.

So the next morning whilst we are leaving hers she was saying stuff like she didn't want me to leave and I thought it went great even though I was a still feeling a bit uncertain about things. Then later on that night we were talking over the phone and I brought up the prior night and we both agreed it to be really good but could have happened later and that we should chill things (sexually) out for a bit which I was quite happy with.

Anyway, for the past week we have been a little bit more hard to work with, she has become easily annoyed by me and when I am talking to her I feel her to be tip toeing around her. The only word I can think of is confused as for example last time we were together we were hanging around in her place and she was making coffee, I was just standing around talking to her and out of no where she says in a really aggressive and agitated tone if I could stop hovering around her, she stays pissed and non talkative about 10 mins until we later watch TV and then cuddle up and kiss and its as if she is completely normal but then I say something like 10 mins later that annoys her and she gets pissed off with me again. This shit is happening very frequently and I think its to do with us both getting intimate quickly. I feel its important to point out we were both not virgins prior to our relationship but its seemed like we have both reacted differently to the advance in the relationship.

Im not exactly sure, but I never thought about my weight too much and never really had body image issues or focused on it much. I went to the gym regularly I would say, I treated myself to frozen pizza, chips, and things without much thought. Come my first year of college (I lived there last year and am staying home this year since I didn't enjoy living there) , I didn't workout regularly and had a better diet, but gained weight and was about 120-122 pounds. I have a much healthier diet since high school, and don't eat as much pizza/ unhealthy snacks but treat myself still. I was upset about my weight the end of my second semester of college and was determined to lose weight over the summer (I have always gained weight over winter/lose in the summer). I am now 101 pounds and lost so much weight (I only wanted to lose 5-10 pounds). My thighs have thinned out, I used to ride/own horses so my calves have lost their muscle, my D cup boobs are now much smaller &amp; I lost some of the ass I had.

I told him I don't like jokes cause they're hurtful and I have cried over them but he says ""he has a joking personality and won't change it for me"", when I told him I get really hurt by them. He calls me 'skinny' and 'a twig' sometimes and doesn't get its just as hurtful as fat shaming someone. he said ""the only way ill gain weight/gain my boobs back is if I get pregnant"".

They have been together for 3 years and I just don’t like him.

Before they did so they sat down and talked about it because Lars really wanted Maria to move in with him but Maria wanted him to know her situation first. Firstly, Maria is in school full time and has a side job, but makes no where near enough for half of what his place costs. Maria has a really troublesome family so sometimes all the money she has will go towards helping out there. Or to saving because she soon has to leave our small town so she can continue to study. (And studying is hella expensive) She would love to move in with him and she could cover some food but that was all she had which he knew. Lars seemed to fully accept this because he has just gotten a job who pays well and they agreed to split the chores evenly but Maria would do most of the kitchen stuff. He seemed really eager to have her move in and brought her along to buy the bed and other needed stuff to make the place liveable. Maria also seemed very happy about this and happily informed us that her friends would soon be invited on dinner to celebrate their new home.

Maria’s home life is problematic to say the least, her mother is mentally ill and Maria has had to deal with a lot of shit growing up. 
And her moving out would need to be a long time commitment because of certain factors at home.

Now suddenly after they have been living together for 2 months Lars has started to use “this is my house” to not allow Maria to do stuff. Which Maria finds unacceptable and he very often backs down during their fights after having said this because Maria gets hurt.
Maria had invited me over to do some painting and while I was there Lars huffed and puffed because he says he didn’t want visitors and that she should have told him.
We did not even stay in the same room as him (even though the apartment is very small). Maria had a really hectic week prior to this (including SURGERY) and did not get any comfort from her boyfriend during this time and he just told her to call over one of her friends to vent to instead because he was too tired (which could be understandable because he is tired) but then he got upset she did that?
Lars has multiple times just left without saying anything and not answered her on the phone even tho she’s scared.
Maria is soon moving again to study (I am moving with her because of the same study), and Lars has started to openly express that he will be miserable when she leaves. She has tried many things to make him deal with it in a healthier way (such as maybe he should get a cat?) but it seems that he just wants to sulk and bring it up each time she says she is excited to study more.

I do not like her boyfriend but I don’t want her to move back home. Lars has proven time and time again (even with family and friends around) that he is an immature and selfish bastard). Is there anything I can say to her to make her understand that she’s worth more than being treated like this?
Am I wrong with being concerned?
Lars says that I don’t know what I’m talking about because I have not been in a relationship before  and I’m queer but I don’t really think that matters?

So we talked in January as soon as I got back from a trip to see my sick brother in Portugal. I told her how I was feeling and that we had two choices. We either opened up and worked to reestablish our relationship or we should break up. I told her I choose to work things out and she told me she preffered to break up.

It's been almost 3 months now and I was fine at first, I thought I could handle it and that I would be fine. But I'm not. It hurts so bad. I'm on therapy, I'm hanging out with my friends and family, I'm going to the gym, dieting, had sex with other girls. No distraction can take my mind of how much I want to be with her, and of how much it hurts, that she turned her back to me. She seems to have no doubt she doesn't want to be with me. Doesn't text, calls or want to see me anywhere near her. Deleted me out of all her social medias. I feel like I turned into something bad in her life. Like the 6 years we were together meant nothing.

I haven't plead, beg, texted, or called her. I deleted all pictures I had with her from my phone so I wouldn't cave to temption. I managed to not cyberstock her or her friends.

I don't feel like I can come back from this.

I just wanted to vent it out somewhere.

Now a few months prior to meeting me she had just broken up with her ex, who was quite the abusive and manipulative partner to her. He kept cheating on her, destroyed her self-esteem and over all did some quite horrible things to her which she has told me about. She was in that relationship for 3 years before getting out of it.

Well nowadays she is a very smart and talented woman and is independent and can really think for herself. Which left me really puzzled how she ended up with the ex anyway even though he put her through so much shit over the years. Note they were living together and the abuse started from the very beginning and this was some serious red-flag stuff which if happened to me I would have gotten out of right away.

Hence here lies the problem, I have a tough time understanding her actions in the situation and understanding the way she acted(aka didnt do anything about it) is really hard for me, because I know that I would have ran from this type of situation right away(The reason I am confident about this is because I have fallen prey to abusive friends and people, but I have a tendency to cut them out of my life very quickly and get out of the situation at hand. My point being if there is a red flag, I keep my distance). 

I  told her this and she thinks that she gets the feeling that I think that I am better than her. When I don't have this feeling at all, I feel sorry for her, this ex really did impact her in terms of confidence and stuff and I just want to help.

She feels hurt and sad due to this and I really don't know what to do...

I have been with men that I have literally had to provide everything for. Example: I was with my ex (33,M) who did not have a car, job, place to live, clothes, etc. (He was a narcissistic drug addict). I let him drive my car all of the time, even more than me. I got an apartment for both of us, bought him a phone (multiple times), bought him an all new wardrobe (multiple times), gave him drug money, supported him while he was in prison, etc. I never received a gift from him, or any sort of support emotionally or financially. I left him a while ago, and have since started dating someone new. We have been dating a few months, and he is AMAZING. He holds literally every single door open for me, he has bought me gifts just because he thought of me, he watches movies I like for me, he is just wonderful. I have never in my life thought such an amazing human was out there, I thought Disney and Pride and Prejudice had legit ruined me on romance. Anyway, he works a lot and he stresses about money sometimes and me being me, I choose to pay for just about everything to take that stress off of him. He does not like this, and puts up a fight sometimes when I try. I'm not saying I buy every single little thing, but just this past week or so I've been not letting him buy things as much. I think it's just due to my past experience and my desire to take care of. However, I do not want to make him feel inferior or take away his independence or his desire to provide as a man.

t2_3hsg4sn3,1553742675.0,b6dpwl,t3_b6dpwl,24,"Hello Reddit. I could use some advice because I don't really have anyone here right now. I'm fairly to my new home and I feel like I am out of place. 

My MIL and FIL died within a year of each other and it was very on my wife. She wanted to continue running their business for them because they left it to her. It's a very good business. They operate in a small town but they have customers all over the United States thanks to the internet. So my boss has allowed me to work from home. I just need to fly to NY once every month for a meeting. The kids were very excited to move which was surprising for me. It was the total opposite of what I was expecting. They were all in on moving. They were saying goodbyes before we even started the whole process of moving. And they've settled in nicely here. They've made lots of new friends. 

My wife has turned into a different person. I got home last week and my son was running around the house. I asked him where his sister was, and my wife let her go out with her friends walking around main street. And I lost it because she's 8. I know we don't live in a big city anymore, but it's still not a good idea to let an 8 year old walk around with friends unsupervised. And she's started to not lock the doors because, 'what's the worse that can happen?'  I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

She agreed to not let our daughter do that again, but she's become so lax with safety here that it's not normal. But yet she acts like I'm being paranoid.

t2_3hiukl34,1553628100.0,b5tzc6,t3_b5tzc6,30,"Sorry for the vague title, I really don't know how to summarize it better.

My husband and I have been together for ten years. A lot of the early years were quite rocky as he was reluctant to get into a serious relationship due to a lot of family obligations (which I will discuss further below). But I was young, optimistic, and in love and stayed the course with him. He was open about the obligations to his family and in time I came to accept it and told him the truth of how I felt - his family was my family, and we were going to take care of them together. 

Over time, however, my feelings about caring for them the way my husband wants to has changed. His mother is a widow and cares full time for his mentally disabled brother who is an adult. My husband’s assessment of the situation is that his mother has tirelessly sacrificed her life to take care of this man and he (my husband) wants to ease her burden as much as she can before she gets too old to enjoy having more of a life, and commit to taking care of his brother for life when his mother is no longer capable.

After many years of long visits with his family and us trying to help out, I see things somewhat differently now. I don’t see his mother as a tireless saint or his brother as a sort of non-functional vegetable, as I had thought. His mother is clearly a lonely woman with a lot of anger stored up, even though she acts like she is as sweet as sugar. I have now seen how manipulative she can be, with my husband and everyone in the family, and how she actually keeps the younger bother housebound and dependent on her. 

His bother, let’s call him Jeff, is way more high-functioning than I was originally lead to believe. He does nothing all day but watch television in a tiny dark room and have his mother make him his specified meals. The sort of narrative they live day to day is that he is pretty much non-functional, like a vegetable, and his mother needs run around buy him his favorite kiddy junk foods and sodas that he eats and drinks all day and every evening cook him a meal he specifies each morning. As time has passed, I have seen that Jeff is completely able to feed himself, make food, even buy groceries when his mother has something else that has to be done. We’ve also had some talks and he seems pretty with it and knows what’s going on in the world, he’s interested in things and even uses a computer (with limited capabilities). He has never lived outside his mother’s house and believes he can do nothing for himself. However, now I see he can probably do a lot. It’s his mother who needs to do these things for him.

The topper about Jeff is that he is not a nice guy to be around, at all. I understand that his lack of social skills is part of his disability, but it doesn’t make him a fun companion. He is never grateful for anything people do for him and is often very critical. He seems to seek to make things more difficult for us, like we finally convinced his mother to go for a very important check-up with her doctor, and he was on the other side convincing her not to do it. Every time we want to do something nice like go out to dinner or take a weekend away together, he thinks of reason it’s a bad idea and insists we don’t go (his mother won’t leave him home alone).

Now, I just feel like a part of the neurotic problems and psychodrama of this family. His mother is no way needs to do all this stuff for Jeff, at least not for Jeff, though I think she has convinced him that is the case. And I do NOT want to spend the waning years of my life waiting hand and foot on Jeff, who doesn’t even like me, but this seems to be the plan for my husband.

The other issue is that I have  had a lot of losses in my life over this time, my parents and my aunt and uncle whom I was very close to. I am an only child and I feel like my husband is my only living family now and it’s much harder for me to share him with his family, even though I know I agreed to this. I see how much he adores his mother, how he wants to do things for her he doesn’t even do for me (e.g. buy her surprise gifts, help her around the house, spend money like water on whatever she wants), and quite frankly I feel a bit envious and a bit abandoned. 

Naturally, I have tried to speak about this with my husband, but a direct approach is definitely not the way to go. (Any other married people trying to criticize your in-laws to your spouse? Yeah, even when they agree it doesn’t always go so well.) He still believes his mother is a self-sacrificing angel, and to some extent that’s true, and that it’s Jeff’s choice to live as shut-in and his abilities allow nothing else. My husband also just feels bad for both of them, feeling they have been dealt a bad hand in life and he just wants to enhance what they have. He also reminds me that he never hid this from me, which is true. However, I learned a lot over time that he wasn’t able to tell me.

He is not totally unreasonable. He used to talk to his mother on the phone every day, now he does it just a few times a week, as per my requests. And we also compromised that I only need to join him on every *other* family visit, and even then no longer than a week (I really can’t stand much more). I should also add that he is very thankful for all my help and understanding with his family, in fact I think it has become his favorite thing about me - which feels like a trap now. If I back out a bit, maybe be won’t love me as much. He has made it clear that there is only so far I can push him because for him it’s almost a matter of life and death with his family. If I force him to choose, he will have to choose them because they will die without him.

I want to renegotiate our original agreement. I don’t want to share my marriage with his mother and I don’t want Jeff to be our child. I want us to have a marriage of our own and kids of our own (he does want kids, in theory, but feels like it’s hard with his family obligations). 

**TL;DR - I agreed to take on my husband’s family as my own, warts and all, and take care of them with him. Now that I am doing that, I realize the situation is very different that I thought and I feel like I can’t do it, and I don’t know how to renegotiate the plan for our marriage.**",relationships,How do I [F/32] talk to my husband [M/34] about renegotiating our life plan to take care of his family?

We have lived together for 2 years. We spend a lot of time together and rarely have arguments, when we do they are resolved quickly.

She is a truly wonderful person, smart, funny, beautiful and very kind and caring. She often volunteers at things like animal shelters, outreach programs for the elderly and groups for mentally disabled people.

It was through one of these that she met ""Harold"".  Im not 100% sure what his mental disabilities are but i think its asbergers and a few other things. Im unfortunately quite ignorant of these things.

He is a few years younger than my gf and from what i know he is by far the youngest of the group that my fiancee volunteers at and doesnt seen to get on with the others. He lives with his parents and is not able to work.

Me and my fiance often hang out with a group of friends at a local bar. We usually do this a few times a month. This group was originally my group before i met her but she has been adopted by the group over the years and a few of her friends joined later. We drink, talk and laugh. Its a great way to relax and catch up with friends.

A few months ago my fiance asked me if i minded if she invited Harold to one of our group social gatherings. She explained he doesnt have any friends and it would be good for him to socialise with other people. I didnt have any problem with this as long as his parents agreed. I asked our group and no one has any problems with it. She did warn me that Howard can be ""a bit intense"" but assured me he was really nice.

The first time i met him we were at the bar with our group. His parents dropped him off. He sees my fiancee, runs to her and gives her a big bear hug and shouted to the entire bar

""This is my &lt;my fiances name&gt;. I love her and im going to marry her""

At first i found this behaviour cute and harmless. I do not any longer. My fiance always invites him now. At first i was ok with this, i am not any longer.

- he is extremely possesive of my fiancee. 

- He will follow her everywhere. (Waits outside the toilet for her, only after she told him to stay outside)

- He has to sit next to her and will cry if he cannot.

- nobody can talk to her apart from him. If somebody else is talking to her he will talk over them or if standing move in between my fiance and whoever is talking (usually me)

- i am not allowed to touch my fiance when he is there. If i do he will either phsyically move my hand or loudly tell me to remove my hand. When i tried to say no to this my fiance told me to humour him.

- he is usually to be found hugging my fiance and telling her that he loves her.

- he wont speak to anyone else. Myself and some of our friends tried to be friendly to him at first, asking him questions and offering him drinks but we got ignored, until my fiance tells him to be nice then we get 1 word answers.

- when it is time for us to leave he will cry or cause a fuss with his parents. Often tries to get in our taxi, saying that he is coming with her.

What i first thought was cute, i now find exhausting. I cant relax when he is around now. Everytime i look at my girlfriend he is there. Everytime i try to talk to her he is there and tries to stop me. Everytime i try i want to touch her he is there and tries to stop me.

I have spoke to her about this and said it makes me very uncomfortable i get told he doesnt mean it and he is harmless.

I have asked her to not invite him any more and i get told but he has no friends and i feel sorry for him and Im trying to help him and he would be so upset if he stopped coming. He loves it and loves spending time with us (by us she means her). His parents say this is really helping him and they have never seen him this way.

I feel like im the bad guy here and i feel guilty because i should be more patient and tolerant because he is mentally disabled. 

This attitude from her i struggle to understand because usually we are able to compromise easily.

I feel like she has backed herself into a position where she wants to look after and help this man but now feels unable to back out now that it is causing other problems

She mentioned inviting him to our wedding but i told her if he was there i would not be.

This is both of our main method of socialising and i dont want to stop because i really enjoy it when he is not there.
Some friends have said that he makes them uncomfortable too but they are more easily able to ignore him.

Am in the wrong here?

How do i get her to stop inviting him? Or at least try and set boundaries. Im trying to be tactful and respectful to his disability.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Tldr kind and caring fiancee keeps inviting a mentally disabled man to group socialising events. He is very possessive of her and it makes me uncomfortable 


EDIT ----------

Ok so this thread exploded unexpectedly
I will try to answer some of the main comments ive seen.

**To those asking about her credentials in regards to mental disability.**

She has none. She has no formal training, that im aware of. She is just generally a very caring person and wants to help people.

**In regards to does the organisation she works for know what is going on.**

I don't know the answer to that. My understanding is that his parents approached her about taking him out to socialise after seeing the way she was with him.
My understanding of the group that she volunteers for, specifically where she met him, is again very limited but it is held at a local community centre and as far as i am aware it is completely volunteer run. I think it is basically just a drop in kind of thing for people with various mental disabilities. I could be wrong I am not sure.

**To those saying that she views him as a status symbol or something or is doing it for attention/ she is a horrible/vile person**

I would say you are completely wrong there. My fiance is not that kind of person, she isnt vain and doesn't do anything for the attention from others. I have perhaps not explained it well but she is really good with him, talks to him and answers his questions, makes sure he has drink (not always alcohol, she generally gets him 1 or 2 alcoholic drinks and the rest are soft drinks). I know 100% that she is trying to help this man as much as she can.

**To those saying her actions are not helping/ boundaries need to be set**

You are right from what you have said. She would be horrified at the thought that she was making things worse for him. This is probably i believe the best route to go down. Any comments or suggestions on how to put this across to her would be appreciated.

**To those that are upset i said he was like a puppy.**

To you, i say that i said he was LIKE a puppy, not he IS a puppy. By that i meant that he acts similarly to a puppy in the sense that he is excitable and affectionate. In no way shape or form did i imply that either myself or my fiance view him as less of a human being, far from it. Now perhaps i should be more careful with which word i choose to use but that does not mean i am a horrible human being. I may be ignorant of what his disability actually is. I may be ignorant of what his mental capabilites are but I am NOT ignorant of that fact that he is a human being. That does not mean that I think he doesnt not deserve every opportunity to live as full as life as possible.

t2_znmhb,1553683079.0,b62vad,t3_b62vad,3,"I've been with my girlfriend for about a year and a half now. Pretty much all the arguments we've had link back to our sexual relationship. I would be the only initiator, she had no idea how to express attraction physically and we'd barely have sex once a week and then turned into less that once a month. We started talking and I tried to help find out the problem was and if there's a way I can help it.

​

She told me she was feeling insecure (she had put on a bit of weight) and how uncomfortable she felt having sex while other where in the house walking around outside (the people in the house liked to stay up really late) and that she just doesn't express her sexual feelings the same way. I never had any problems with either of these issues so I tried to help encourage her and told her there wasn't anything really to worry about. I showed her how hard it is to hear anything outside the room, how I've never had any problem with the way she looks and tried to help her feel more comfortable and let her know having that feeling of sexual attraction from the other person was very important for me. She seemed to change her mind a bit and I thought the problem was fixing but it about a week before the dry spell came back.

​

I do love most of the other things about the relationship but this has just been such a drain. It came to the point of me not feeling any sexual attraction from her and, although she would say she would but she could never actually show it even after I gave some examples of what she could try. I do get told I'm good looking and I train and eat pretty well so it's hard to have someone who doesn't seem to show a sexual 'want' when they see you like you do for them. Doesn't do your confidence a lot of favours. I ended up trying to break up with her saying we might as well be friends because that's kind of what the relationship felt like.

​

She was absolutely devastated. She promised to work on it and she kind of did again. She went out and bought some costumes to try something new but the sex was still so average.  Despite me trying to teach her what feels good, she has not idea how to give a blowjob and has never made me come with her half hearted handjobs. I even stopped masturbating to hopefully make it easier. Still hasn't happened, it's back to once a week and she still doesn't initiate it. She apparently loves when I fuck her and I can give her toe curling orgasms but when it comes to trying to pleasure me, it has become so uncomfortable. It just becomes her trying her best, me giving her advice then she'll try before giving up, feeling, upset with herself and defeated which kills the mood.


It has ended up that I'm just getting angry. I'm a lot more short with her. I'm not really trying anymore. I used to take her out when she was struggling with her job situation but that barely got reciprocated so I ended up stopping that.

​

I know what good sex is though and that's what is hard. My previous girlfriend was an absolute sex maniac. I had absolutely no doubt how attracted to me she was, she could barely keep her hands off me, she learned exactly what I liked within a week of us being together and both of us couldn't get enough. Sex in public, while we're driving, inviting girls, just changing in the morning and I'd be jumped. It ended up turning to shit and it didn't work out. It's just hard that I may never get this side of the relationship with my current girlfriend.

​

I tried breaking up again but it's just hard. This is the only thing in the way of us together. She's a lot more ambitious than a lot of the other girls I know. She's dedicated and honest and she still loves me a lot even though she has no idea how to show her sexual side. Part of me wants to call it cos I just don't know if that side it going to get better but a big part of me still loves her a lot and everything else. I just don't know what to do.


She's been begging me to move it together just by ourselves hoping that it would change things and I've finally caved and we're trying it right now but it just doesn't feel right. Am I not giving it enough time but how do I let her down easily. I haven't had to do it before in a serious relationship and it's just eating me up because she's been through a lot over the past year outside of our relationship.

t2_503mkjj,1553695547.0,b64wbb,t3_b64wbb,1,"I'm Portuguese, she's German. I was working for some time in Germany and we met there. After some months of dating we got into a commited relationship in which we have been for around a year now. Although, I couldn't take it anymore in the city where I was living - I was feeling too lonely and out of place (I was living on my own), and the rough winter also took a toll on my mental health. So I found a job back in Portugal and decided I would come back, and left it up to her whether she would like to come with me, which she did - as she was just out of college and didn't have a job there yet, so not much to lose. We found a flat in Portugal and moved in together - this was not an easy transition for me as it was actually the first time I was living with a girlfriend.

After a month here she got a job, where she has been for 6 months now. Things have been going really well between us, although the job she got is not well paid, nor in the field that she wants to be. She could look for something else, but her perspectives of finding a good job in Portugal in her field are not good either. So now, after seeing this reality and given that I started working remotely as a freelancer (not bound at all to an office), some time ago we agreed that she should start looking for a new job, even if it was in Germany, and I would join - always taking into account that there would be the possibility that I wouldn't adapt in Germany as it happened before. So she found that an institute in Germany where she has done an internship before is currently hiring for a position that she would like to get, and we agreed that she should apply - she is currently working on her application. She said that for her it was really hard if she had to choose between staying with me here or applying to the job. As if she stayed she didn't have good perspectives of work, and if she went she would be unhappy because she would lose me.

Moving back to Germany would not be ideal for me, as all my friends and family are here, but that's ""all"" I had to lose. Although circumstances have changed in the past few days. My best friend just quit his job, and we have been wanting to start a business together for some years now. So if that were to happen, the time would be now that neither of us is tied to an unflexible job.

So now I'm stuck in this indecision - should I move back to Germany and stay with my girlfriend who I love, or stay here and invest in this business with my friend? The fact that I have told her that she should apply also makes me feel bad about the thought of actually reconsidering this, as I really don't like to take my word back.

She’s aware I’m not being myself and doesn’t like it but when I explained why, she didn’t like that I wind her up but doesn’t like when I don’t do it. So I’m really unsure of how to be which has led to me being a little distant.

Some of the examples are indeed signs of desperation, like a woman quitting her job for her man, stalking, bombarding with texts, and another bringing up the idea of marriage on the first date.

It made me think I might be thinking what I'm doing for my boyfriend is compromising for his sake, but it also made me think maybe I'm desperate.

Desperate to keep him, desperate to make the relationship work, desperate because I want a relationship and I'm tired of staying in the dating phase.

1. He doesn't say much and he sometimes ignores me. I want to confront him about it but I also don't want to make him mad.
2. He has a high libido and I don't want sex that much. But I try to keep up with him.
3. I cook for him (he cooks for me too though).
4. I ate the sausage he cooked even though I don't eat red meat at all. But I told him after that I don't really eat red meat and he said I can eat something else next time.
5. I'm willing to stay with him even when there's a 30% chance he has to leave because of Visa issues.

Please tell me, how can I show I truly care for him without scaring him off? How can I show him my love and my willingness to compromise for his sake without coming off as desperate?

t2_3exlhws,1553624144.0,b5t5hw,t3_b5t5hw,60,"The past several months in my home has been absolutely miserable. I live in a very strict mormon household, and despite my efforts to live the lifestyle, it’s just not for me. Regardless of my feelings, I’ve been putting on a fake mormon face to get my parents to leave me alone about it. It’s not really working. They can tell i’m uninterested despite my faking efforts. I’d like to be myself and speak my mind around my mom, but that’s like asking to be put under house arrest.

We just recently moved about 30 minutes away from my hometown, and she gets mad when i reach out to my old friends because most of them are LGBT and/or not mormon. She gets mad that I’m making new friends here that aren’t mormon. Basically, she expects me to be completely alone if it means not having friends that “lift me up” (friends that are lds). I understand it’s better to have no friends rather than having bad friends, but my friends aren’t bad. they’re kind, they look out for me, and they values my company. She just assumes they are bad because they don’t go to church.

My mom frequently goes though my cell phone and my text messages with my friends. She deactivated my iMessage in case i try to delete anything, so she can still read my messages though our service provider. I’m not allowed to have my phone in my bedroom at night. She went though my bedroom and got mad when she found a sex toy. I’m not allowed to use my laptop in my room at all. All of the websites on my phone are restricted until she manually unlocks them. It’s incredibly embarrassing when someone asks me to look something up and I have to explain why I can’t. I have to ask permission to get apps on my phone through a notification she gets. Point is, all access to and through the internet is heavily monitored and controlled. i’m lucky she knows little-to-nothing about reddit. She excuses her actions by reminding me that her parents didn’t pay very much attention to her growing up.

Whenever i try to defend myself, i’m always wrong. plus, my stepdad is more rational than her, but not rational enough. A lot of the time, he just backs her up. She calls me a bully and compares me to my dad (he cheated on her and emotionally abused her for their entire marriage). she reminds me how much prettier i would be with long hair. She tells me i should go to BYU provo instead of the school i’ll actually be attending (Utah State). I feel like i’m never allowed to be right. I try to find compromises between our differing ideas, but she refuses to try to make those work and insists that we do it her way. At this point, i’ve completely given up on defending myself. When she gets on me about something, i just sit in silence. it is safer for me to refuse to communicate anything. as much as i’d like to communicate with her, it’s just not possible. this makes her mad too. nothing i do is right unless i suddenly decide to agree with her completely.

i feel like an absolute burden to her. she gets mad when i ask for help, whether that be advice or financial help. she tells me she never gets time with her husband because her kids (usually when she says this she’s implying me) take up all of their time. When i go to her for financial help, she reminds me we’re poor and she says i only use her for money. Keep in mind, i’m still in high school and i don’t pay for my own groceries, deodorant, clothing, etc. anymore. financially, i barely exist in my house. they don’t buy food unless it’s food for them or my little brothers. 

one of the reasons that she’s super strict is because she thinks the only way i can have a happy life is through a mormon one. she doesn’t think i can be happy if i don’t get married in the temple at 19. she doesn’t think i can be happy if i don’t go to church every week. any amount of interest i previously had in mormonism has been completely diminished by forceful her actions.

On top of all of this, I’m moving out in 5 months. I’m very close to real adulthood (i’m already there by legal standards) , and i’m being treated like a child. She knows she doesn’t have much time with me. 

Is it a dick move of me to not want a relationship with her anymore? is this emotional abuse, or am i just being a bratty teen who’s ready to move out? anyone with a similar experience?

tl;dr: i’m suffocating in my mormon household. i have very little freedom and it’s very difficult to make friends. i feel like i’m not being treated well, but i can’t tell whether or not i’m just being a bratty teenager.

For the last year it's been an almost constant argument in the morning on when we leave. I like a schedule where I get up, get dressed, make breakfast (for us both) and leave at a set time knowing how long it takes to get to work. 

My husband however has a much more lax attitude of he'll leave when he feels like it. 

Now our bosses are pretty lax in our hours but the expectation is standard 8-5. We do occasionally need to stay late to get things done but we also don't have strict lunch breaks and if there's an errand or something we can run do it without nitpicking our leave. 

I think it's professional to be in place at a set time and we already have a good deal in the lunch/errands arena and it's important to show management we aren't taking advantage of things by having some things be consistent like when we get in. 

My husband claims that studies prove an 8am start is too early for many people and 40 hour work weeks aren't actually productive. His work is more random than mine in needing some things done immediately and more often has to stay late to finish things so he claims he does the work/time.

My husband feels it's important that we go in to work together and leave together. He says he enjoys the time with just us and thinks it's a perception issue if we don't go in together. 

We have had comments made about us being consistently late by other co-workers and occasionally other management but nothing from our bosses technically.

Now I've already pushed back when we leave from when I used to leave (originally left at 7:20, then it was at 7:30, today was 7:40) but that time never seems to be enough. It's just getting further and further to the right. I feel like I've tried to accommodate his routine but it's like I gave an inch and he wants the mile. 

In addition he literally doesn't finish getting ready after breakfast until I say something. But no matter what time I say it (or how - I just ask 'ready?') he gets frustrated that I'm rushing him. He even admits that it doesn't matter when or how I ask that he will be mad. He says that he can't help his feelings but that I shouldn't be trying to get him to leave bc we get in when we get in. I should just stop being so worried about being on time bc we still do the work. He says in this case my feelings aren't as valid as his.

He claims I can leave without him but if I do so he'll still be frustrated (I've tried before and he just says I'm rushing him and if I'd just wait a few more minutes he'd be ready) and if I get home before him then I should be cooking even if it would have been his night (we alternate nights). 

Am I being overbearing? Do I just give up and leave when he's finally ready? Do I say screw it and leave when I'm ready and be on time even if I don't have a specific action needed that day?

t2_11n77g9,1553707762.0,b6728j,t3_b6728j,9,"I'm crossposting this from /nonmonogamy, because there hasn't been a reaction so far.

When my boyfriend and I started dating 1,5 years ago, I already knew he was bisexual, but hasn't had any experience with other men yet. He was always very open to me about how there is still curiousness on his part, but also that he wants to put those feelings aside for our relationship. I never ruled the possibility of him exploring his sexuality out, but I also told him the prospect scares me and that I need to feel safer in my relationship in order to be fine with that and not feel invalidated.

A little something to me - I'm not interested in any experiences with other people at the time, be it male or female, nor in a threesome. I've recently identified with the term demisexual, which means I can only feel sexual attraction towards people I've already developed some kind of meaningful relationship with (and even then it's not guaranteed), so you could say in a way I'm asexual towards everyone except my boyfriend. Finding out about that helped me understand that everyone experiences attraction differently, and it actually made me feel less insecure about his desires.

A few weeks ago I had a deeper conversation with him about how I feel I invest more into our relationship than he does - I text him more often, I want sex more often, I suggest meeting up more often, I initiate conversations more often. I'm the only one who says ""I love you"". He did write it via text twice so far, but other than that, he just said it is difficult for him to express himself verbally and he only wants to do it when he really feels it. But since he shows his affection in other ways - he is very cuddly, he always listens respectfully when I have things like these on my mind and never brushes me off, he is honest, he tells me what he values in our relationship, he sets his own needs back when he notices I need him, we have a really great sex life - I've made my peace with waiting. After all, I think FEELING loved is more important than being told those words.

But after that conversation, he wrote a letter to me in which he admitted that, even though he is happy with our relationship, a part of him is unhappy, because he can never shut off those thoughts about trying out his sexuality. He believes that is the reason he is not as invested into our relationship as I am. He didn't press me into deciding anything, and emphasized we have time to figure out what to do. I told him I think we should talk about what he wants more openly, because his desires actually don't scare me. What scares me is the possibility of screwing up this relationship. So we talked about what would in theory probably work for me: Lots of communication, figuring out what we are both ok with step by step, restricting his experience to strangers instead of acquaintances, things like that.

It was really great how calm I felt talking about those things with him, but I don't want to agree on anything concrete as long as I'm still uncertain about his feelings towards me. I'm hoping that, if we communicate openly and he realizes I support his need to try himself out, that might stabilize our relationship to a level where I feel comfortable to give the ""go-signal"". But I don't know if that will work. It might seem a weirdly specific condition, but I really don't want to open up the relationship before I've heard him tell me he loves me (I haven't told him about that condition).

I don't want to open up for the wrong reasons, like just agreeing to it hoping it will make him love me more. I guess there is just two scenarios that can happen: Either he does give me what I need to feel safe enough in this relationship, so I can agree on opening up, or I decide it's not enough for me, and he has to try himself out on his own. I just don't know, how or when I would realize, if the latter scenario is the right solution. I love him and he makes me happy, so of course I wouldn't want to do that. How long should I wait?


TL;DR: My boyfriend is bisexual and wants to have his first experiences with other men. He values ouor relationship and doesn't put pressure on me. I support him and can imagine opening our relationship up, but I need to feel more like he is emotionally on my level (e.g. him saying ""I love you""), before I could agree on anything.

t2_1pdqwa6z,1553663357.0,b60c9b,t3_b60c9b,4,"Before I get into the details of my friend &amp; I's relationship, I want to put my dating life in context.  I met my first girlfriend the summer before my senior year of high school.  She was the first person I ever met who I felt understood me, and she felt that way too.  We were both kind of loners who didn't fit in very well at school, but a lot of why she didn't fit in was because of some mental problems she had.  She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when she was 14, and had been on medication for it.  I always thought she had a good handle on it, but there was one week when she stopped taking her medication.  She became very paranoid, and ran away from home.  No one could find her, but she sent me a text saying she didn't belong anywhere and that .  She killed herself a day later and I was absolutely devastated.   I lost the only person in the world who I felt understood me, so I just shut off.  For the first two years, I was super depressed.  I met some good people though that helped me get out of that funk though.  A couple more years later to June 2018, and this is when I met my \[27F\] friend.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend and I have  known each other for a little over 9 months now, and we go at the same college.  Currently, she's in here last semester here.  When we first met she already had a boyfriend, but I wasn't really interested in her at the time.  As we got to be better friends, I started to feel a connection with her.  She was still with her boyfriend throughout the fall semester, so I didn't think that I had a chance to get closer.  They ended up breaking up over the winter break, so we started hanging out &amp; talking more.  It wasn't anything big we did that made me start to like her more.  We would just sit and talk, or even just enjoy each other's company.  Whenever we talk though, it feels like how talking to my late girlfriend was.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, it was the anniversary of her death.  This got in my head a bit because my \[27F\] friend reminds me so much of her.  I started acting a bit weird around her because of it.  A mutual friend told me that she was scared that she said something that offended me, and was upset about it.  The mutual friend &amp; I talked more about how I felt about my friend.  He made it seem that we \[me &amp; 27F\] share the same feelings.  This was such a relief for me.  Because even though I feel a connection to her, I wonder if I'm clingy because she reminds me of my late girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said earlier she's in her last semester here, and she is going to move out of town for one of her job offers in the summer.  I when I start thinking that when she moves away, if we start dating and break up it might leave me back in a depression again.  Still, whenever I think about her I feel happy and at peace like I haven't for a long time.  It's been really killer for me over the past week.  I keep flipping between being happy that I can feel this way again, and frustrated at how we're going to be parting ways when things just got started.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I feel this way about her, I'm scared that I'm being super selfish.  I don't know if it's fair to her to try to start dating right as she's on the way out.  She'll be within 1-2 hours of driving after moving, but that already seems like it would be the start of a long-distance situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my biggest questions are:

Should I try dating her even if it might bring up my depression again if we breakup soon?

Am I being fair to her if I lead her into a situation where it's either breakup or a long-distance relationship?

t2_2lsu7mde,1553692459.0,b64cg5,t3_b64cg5,16,"TLDR at the bottom.

Me (22F) and my partner (22M) have been together for the past 3 years. It was a bit of whirlwind romance, and we moved in together very early on due to financial reasons (we are both uni students, it's how we met).  
All in all our relationship has been great. We've both been in abusive relationships, so we agreed that we were going to do everything in our power to make sure this relationship is healthy and well-functioning.  
We never fight, at least not in like an angry-screaming way. We have looked up methods for healthy conflict resolution, and whenever a disagreement occurs we use those techniques to talk it out until the situation is resolved. Our mantra is ""It's not a you vs me problem, it's an us problem.""  


I really do love my partner more than anything in the world. We have agreed on a lot of things about our future - we want to get married at some point, we don't want a public proposal but a private one, we'd like to have one child preferably and we'd like to work on our careers for a bit before we do so. We have also discussed what we will do if those plans don't work out, and the general consensus is that as long as we have each other we will find joy wherever life takes us.  
My partner is an amazingly loving person. We joke that I'm usually 'the man' in the relationship because I'm more results-oriented and he's more emotions-oriented, but we maintain a healthy balance. I can be relied upon to help us figure out a tricky situation or know when we need to start working on our assignments, and he sits me down when I get upset and helps me sort through my emotions (sometimes I have a hard time figuring out what the hell I'm feeling, and I'll just go 'there is upset happening and I don't know why' and he always helps so much). I have been going to therapy and I have been doing a lot better on this front, and he's told me time and time again that he's fine with helping me in this manner because I help him with other matters in return (which duh, I love him, of course I'll help).   
I feel like I need to say all this because the next bit will paint my love in a very bad light, and I really don't want anyone to think he is malicious, or cruel, or disregarding of my emotions. He isn't. He really isn't. I've never met someone who is so deeply kind and compassionate to me before. But that just makes what happened even more difficult to sort through.  


I'm from another country. I don't get to see my family much, I usually travel up for summers and then winter and Easter break. That's all I get. I used to be a huge homebody, and I'm very close to my mother, and I do get very homesick sometimes. This January my mom slipped on some ice and broke her leg. I got a call from my stepdad that she was having emergency surgery and it was a very upsetting time for all of us, especially as she went into a depression shortly afterwards.  
With that in mind I am more eager to get home for Easter Break than I have been in a while.  
There is also the added factor that my partner lost his mom recently and very unexpectedly (early January). It has been a very difficult time for us all, and he's struggled a lot with depression and grief but is getting counseling and I have done my very best to be emotionally supportive and helpful throughout it all. All things considered we've been doing okay despite the circumstances.   


We both work part time jobs. I got my vacation approved for my job very easily because I get to schedule what days I work throughout the month, so I just didn't put myself down for any of the days I'll be gone. He had to ask his work about it.  
He sent them an email, was told someone needed to check with an HR person, and then we didn't hear more for a while. I asked that he ask them in person, he did and still didn't receive a reply, so I said I was starting to feel anxious and if he could please send them another email so we could get to booking the airplane tickets and such. This was two weeks ago, roundabouts.   


Well today I asked him again to check if he had received a reply because I woke up feeling very anxious about it, and he told me he would. He hadn't, so I said ""Well, when did you send it off again? They really need to work on their response time""  
And he looked through his sent emails. Turns out he never sent them another email.  
Now this in itself is very upsetting. But I know grief can cause forgetfulness, so I was trying to be understanding about it. This is something he has been struggling with a bit, and it has been frustrating but it's not his fault. I asked if maybe it was in his drafts, and when he wrote it and such.   
Turns out he lied about sending it completely. He told me he had put it off and that he had panicked about not doing it so  he lied, and then he just kind of kept lying about it.   
I'm so angry. I don't get angry often, but in that moment I genuinely felt like throwing something, or screaming, or anything. So I calmly explained I was very upset and hurt, and that I think it'd be best if he headed off to uni early so I could work through these emotions in a quiet space because I didn't trust myself to react well or be able to have a reasonable conversation about this right now.   


Thing is - I still don't. I am so angry! I am so hurt!! I feel so deeply betrayed by this. I can't believe he'd lie to me, and I keep trying to reconcile it in my head and I can't and I really don't know what to do. I feel so absolutely blindsided because I thought we could tell each other anything, and that if something went wrong we always told the other one, and that we made sure to foster an environment where you don't lie in order to avoid upsetting someone, you tell them and then we resolve it calmly.

I love him, but my first thought in the moment of upset was that I wanted to leave and never come back, or go on my Easter Break alone or anything rather than stay and deal with how upset I am. But I can't do that, and I won't. It's not fair on either of us if I do so.   


So my question is - *how the hell do I go about dealing with this?* Or rather how do WE go about dealing with this? What can I say, what can I do? How do I convey how I feel without getting emotional?? I'm usually so good at that, but right now it feels unattainable. And how do I forgive this?   


I just feel really lost, and really really sad right now.   


**TL;DR:** Partner lied about asking workplace for vacation over Easter break for a visit home to my family which meant a lot to me. I feel very hurt and very upset by this because this sort of situation has never happened before, and am wondering how to go about resolving it.

t2_zhmzi,1553692176.0,b64als,t3_b64als,10,"Long story short I kind of fell on my boyfriend’s lap. He dated but maybe he wasn’t looking for anything serious. He wasn’t over his ex girlfriend, was in the grieving stage to where he’d get drunk every time we hung out. I was 20 at the time and more naive, so it didn’t click. He was with her for 4 years and she cheated on him and got pregnant by another man. He still stayed with her throughout the whole pregnancy and then she ghosted him. She later called him like 6 months down the road to apologize to him and how she is a registered nurse now. I noticed how before, he’d always get sad even mentioning the word nurse. He would cry a lot about her and talk about how much he dreamed about her. I, like an idiot, held on to the relationship in the hopes he’d get over her. He treated me very kindly, maybe the 7 year age difference is what it is since he more mature than I am, but it would hurt every time knowing I wasn’t the only one in his mind. 3 years in a half into the relationship, I can’t seem but to always bring her up. The relationship almost doesn’t exist without me thinking about her. I get so angry at school knowing she’s a successful nurse and I’m still going at it trying to become something. I feel so bad it didn’t work out between them, because he would have been better off despite her cheating. I am kind of angry at her for cheating in the first place. I guess I feel terribly awful he had to end up with someone like me. I have terrible self esteem and I don’t even believe him when he says he loves me because I just think about her and how madly in love with her he still was when he was first dating me. I don’t know how to get her out of my head. Anything nice that happens in the relationship I always tend to think he had it better with her. I know she was more outgoing and had more friends. They snap chatted a lot and we don’t Snapchat at all. I know people have their pasts, but god it makes me so angry that I feel like second best. But he is a good guy and he insists he loves me with all of his heart and doesn’t think about her. I don’t know what to do anymore. Am I overreacting?

I can’t seem to enjoy anything without thinking about her and I always bring her up to him. I even mention to go back with her because she sounds to be great. I am always angry about it, feeling like I was second best and had to play the waiting game for him to come around and give himself fully to me.

t2_2pj3jyna,1553705407.0,b66kew,t3_b66kew,8,"I'm 19 years old and been with my boyfriend for about 2 years now. The first year we were just friends but that was growing into a very close friendship. I met him in the first few weeks of university and became friends cuz I felt understood and free around him as it was my first time being in a new country all by myself. I had so much trouble talking to people and making friends and getting familiar with the place I was. So you can imagine how close we became plus we're in the same program. I didn't know it but we we're both starting to have feelings for each other. And especially for me I was blind to it since I was in a long distance relationship with a guy who I loved and was my first(but we barely dated before I had to leave for university, I can go in details of this story if needed). 

To keep it short, as you could have guessed from above, I broke up with my long distance boyfriend and got together with him(it wasn't 100% because of him but he was the reason I realized some stuff about the relationship). Then after we got together things were and are really great. He's very respectful, caring and loving. He's always going the extra mile for me and never gets tired. I'm surprised that he has stayed this long cuz I usually push people away. I admit that I am a hard person to be with because of that, I don't know why but it's almost like an instinct. 

After a few months of being together the arguments started. We never disrespect each other or anything but we would argue over nothing but solve it shortly. The most difficult argument we had and still have is about sex. Sexual intimacy means a lot to me and physical affection is my love language. He on the other hand is more into gestures and verbal expression of love. He's also a Christian(I am too but not as much as him and our background is different) and wants to wait till marriage for sex. But being so attracted to each other we could wait that long which in our case would be another 6 or 7 years. 

And that's where I feel like our main trouble started. For me, giving myself like that for the first time meant a lot and it made me even more vulnerable towards him. Seeing him not very happy and free about it (because of what he knows about marriage and sex) hurt me alot but I understood too. I also don't want it to be like this, I want him to feel free. What I'm looking for isn't the physical pleasure, it's the intimacy I feel after. And we usually argue after sex which just ruins the experience for me. The reason we argue is because I can see how he's feeling and it makes me feel distant and I became quiet and reserved. He tells me that I shouldn't feel that way and the reason behind what he's feeling is what he believes. So then even tho I don't really agree, we agree to not do it anymore. This makes me feel even more distant and withdrawn from the relationship. Is it normal to feel? On top of that, I feel bad cuz this doesn't seem like a big deal for him but gets to me alot n I feel like I'm just 'looking for sex' but I actually care about this guy. After a while, we can't resist each other then we do it again... Going through this loop endlessly.

Lately I'm just tired of it, although he doesn't feel 'guilty'(not sure if it's the right word) about what he believes as strongly as before, I feel like going through all those things and crying has made me numb. I used to be very active sexually but now I reconsider everything I do and am  scared to make the first move. I don't like it at all cuz I've always dreamed of a relationship that I can be totally free and him as well. I feel trapped and unhappy. Guilty at the same time cuz this guy is close to perfect. On top of that my friends keep telling me that I should break it off and it's really annoying since we're all in the same friend group.  And even worse I'm moving in with them this year.

I don't really have good thoughts when I think about the relationship but again I know I tend to be negative and forget the good times so I can't trust my memory. Our lives are so intertwined that I don't even know how to break up even if I decide to do so.

 What do you think about this situation? Am I being irrational and overthinking or are my feelings actually valid? What should I be doing right now before it gets even more complicated?

But now, I cannot ignore that anymore and I'm starting to think they are a deal breaker. She hates my family, she basically always has since we first started dating. She has a ridiculously quick temper that takes hours or days to go away. She is pretty racist towards anyone who isn't white. She has absolutely no patience with anyone, including me, and almost demands perfection, calling me names if I ever slip up. She smokes a lot of pot, and while she has lessened it, she used to smoke up to 14 bowls a day, and while she thinks she doesnt change mich when she is high, she changes a lot. She becomes much sweeter, affectionate, and generally agreeable. Because of this, I find my self waiting for her to get high before fully wanting to interact with her, which sounds horrible but I can't help it. 

It doesnt help that I am the exact opposite. I'm super passive, I have a ridiculous amount of patience for other people (unless I'm driving haha), and they way she talks to other people sickens me sometimes.

- He acts like he’s better than us because he’s in STEM. He told me and my friend (who is also doing 2 non-STEM degrees, later called NF for normal friend) that we need to “leave math to the STEM majors” in a discussion about *basic addition*.  
- He puts us down for not being in STEM. He somehow inserts our majors into every discussion!
- He’s lowkey shamed NF for only speaking one language, and he’s shamed me for making any mistake in my 2nd language (which he’s fluent in).  
- If we ever talk about an achievement we have, he barely acknowledges it and doesn’t mention it again (unless it’s to put us down). But he repeatedly mentions his achievements very often, without prompting. 
- He plays guitar/sings during our calls. He often does it when he’s been killed in-game, but it’s frustrating because *we’re* usually still alive and he’s distracting us!  
- He also tries to ask us questions or tell us stories (and expecting input/reactions) mid-game/mid-fight.  
- He tells us stories worthy of r/ThatHappened about how he “wrecks”/insults his professors “because he can” (he says they wouldn’t expel him because they *really* want him there!).  
  
Now I’m at a loss, and NF is too. I’ve been ignoring BG’s requests to play by going invisible on Origin/Discord, but I can’t avoid him forever. I really suck at confrontation as well.  
  
So what do I do? How do I avoid blowing this up or making BG feel like a terrible person?

I've supported her this entire time, paying all the bills while she does budgeting, shopping and chores. I'm starting to think raising a family but I'm concerned about my Gfs unemployment status. I come from a home where my dad was pretty much a dead beat so I highly value households with 2 sources of income. A stay at home spouse is not an option for me.

Sometimes I have to lie to my friends &amp; family about her employment status so that they don't judge my choice to stick it out with her.

t2_33ij0umk,1553667469.0,b60w9w,t3_b60w9w,3,"I’ve been holding off on asking for advice because I feel like an entitled brat.

To give some background...I moved out on my own at 19 working a full time job and going to nursing school. I’m almost done with school now, and still live entirely on my own. My parents do not provide assistance for me in everyday life because I took off on my own which is fine and reasonable imo. I decided to live a more difficult (financially) life and be on my own because their home is a very high stress place. Lots of yelling and disorder due to conflicting personalities. It triggered my anxiety so I left. I have two siblings (an older sister and a younger brother) who I love dearly and are on the same page with me. We’ve tried therapy - my dad just says they don’t know what they’re talking about and will not commit to it. I’ve just accepted that’s who they are until now.

Now that I do not live there, we have a pretty great relationship beyond this event. I don’t see them everyday, maybe once a week or once every two weeks. We talk mostly everyday, though. This works well in that there’s no tension and I usually have a great time when visiting them.

However,  they usually convince me to go on a huge one week vacation with them and my siblings. The last few years, I have been declining because well...they’re horrible on vacations and miserable. This year they got me to go by saying they’d pay and it’d be great and how much they missed me. My fault for being naive, but I really want to have a good time with them when I can - I love them.

Needless to say, the time was awful. We went to Disney, my siblings came and so did my 70 y/o grandmother with her 7 y/o adopted son. My grandmother is having a hard time walking and they refused to slow down for her and talked bad about her the whole time. They yelled the whole time. Fought every single night about lack of sleep. Every day one of them said it was the worst vacation of their life or threatened to fly home. Don’t even get me started on how stressful the airport was with them.

The worst part is that my siblings and I had a wonderful time...when they weren’t there. It was stress free. When we were around them, we were screamed at for even laughing around them and I was told I act like a 12 year old. 

I came home a ball of anxiety, sick with a cold and completely out of sorts. My boyfriend noted it and I spent Sunday evening crying in his arms about how dysfunctional everything was and how I don’t want to be around them after the high stress experience. He I haven’t spoken much to either parent since we came home.

Boyfriend said to just fall back on contact.  The thing is...I feel guilty. My parents both HAVE done a lot for me growing up. I was taken care of despite the chaotic environment. Plus they just spent all that money on a vacation for everyone that they were miserable on. I wish I could just say “whatever” and leave them to their own devices but it feels...wrong.

Any advice?

I’ve know Britney* for about three years now and after a living together for a year, moving out on my own for another, and eventually moving back this year I’ve noticed our relationship has changed a lot.
She has become very controlling over my life and sort of inserts herself into all of my plans. If I don’t include her she uses passive aggressive remarks which I find hurt deeply and are embarrassing. 

An example of this was today I was on my phone and she saw messages from a group chat with friends from our course (we do the same degree) and she started saying how shady it was she wasn’t in the chat (we were in public) I didnt even make the chat and she isn’t friends with most of the people in it. 

There are a whole host of other examples but she often makes comments about the way I dress and my choices to do certain things. I feel added pressure as it seems like I’m her only close friend.

What should I do about all the passiveness?

She came with her brother and niece recently, then stayed on at my house after brother (so my uncle) and niece went home. Her behaviour changed immediately and she went completely silent, staring into the distance and wringing her hands. At first I asked normally what's wrong but then gave up as she shrugged me off.

Visit
During the next few days I found out what was wrong. She complained about something new everyday. Since she is temporarily in another country, I agreed she could redirect the post to my house, and upon her request I open it, send her pics and store it for her. Apparently I wasn't doing this quick or clear enough and according to her stored it in a mess. Simply untrue, it was stored neatly in my cupboard. I said this and it escalates to her saying I always get defensive and negative, just as negative as I had been about the piano.

Piano 
So the fight jumps to the piano. For background the piano is mine and in my house, she actually has no say in what happens to it. Previously we had been whatsapping because I let her know I was selling it. In the messages, she insisted I sell at a ridiculously high price, so I told her I had it valued and sent her the evaluation. To this she wrote that I was stubborn and always had to have the last word. Then she stopped responding. Only to bring this disagreement up weeks later in a fight about post. It's all so petty but she escalates it by talking about what's wrong with ME instead of the issue at hand. 

Bf

Here's where she crossed the line. She again repeated I was negative, stubborn and had to have the last word, and then said ""so ask yourself why your boyfriend doesn't want you anymore?"" I was so shocked at first. I had previously confided in her that I was upset/lonely that my bf was working lots and coming home v late so we couldn't spend time together. I said ""how can you use this sensitive thing I told you, and say he works late because of these nasty judgements you just made about me?"" To which she repeated over and over ""yeah ask yourself, he must be avoiding you because you're *insert random criticisms from above*""

I stopped answering this taunt and she went upstairs. The last few days of the visit passed in awkward silence and she went back to the other country. I don't want to whatsapp anything personal lest she use in in the next fight. But I want to get on with my mum because she is, well, my mum. So how can I explain why it hurt me so gravely and she must never do it again? And bonus, how to quit nagging and butting in things that don't concern Her?

Tldr: we had a huge argument in which she used stuff I'd confided in her against me thereby breaking my trust. Haven't spoken to her since and need a way to tell her what's wrong without another screaming match.",relationships,I [29F] don't know how to reconcile with mother [50sF]

Throwaway cause people know my real username.

First off I guess the most obvious thing to point out is the age difference, which most likely plays an important factor into this. Also, this post is most likely not going to be interesting for most people, considering some of the posts I see on this sub. I guess I just need to type out my feelings on this matter.

To give some preface, I got out of a 1 year relationship approximately 2 months ago, and I started talking to this girl (G) approximately 1 month ago.

G is someone that I've known for almost a year, not well, but we were classmates that rarely talked. The reason why we started talking is because she made a post on Instagram which I commented on and we started talking from there. We really hit off for the first few weeks and we would talk until 2am-4am every night even though we both had work in the morning.

She suggested to meet up maybe after one week after we started messaging each other and originally I said no, since I was still unsure about the situation with my ex. However, she asked again not long after, I agreed and after that we started meeting up maybe once a week (since she lives quite far away). 

Throughout this month, we both mentioned that we have feelings for each other, but obviously there were many things to consider, including age difference, logistics. etc, and the most important part is that I still haven't fully gotten over my ex (which she knows about). She said she wanted to be together, but it was up to me and I chose to give it a little more time first, because I wanted to be fair on her. At that point, our relationship could be considered as, we were basically together but without the official title.

However, since approximately two weeks ago, things started to change, we started talking less because she didn't reply as often. Despite this, she asked me for dinner last friday and after dinner I told her I wanted to talk about us. I was honest and told her that things felt a little different, in which she replied that she's been really busy lately (which I know she is), because we spent so much time talking before, all the workload is catching up on her. She also reassured me that, if I think that she's talking to someone else then I'm wrong, and that she is still interested in me but now, she wants to have a proper think about us first before deciding whether she wants to be in a relationship with me because she's at the age where she wants something serious, and also said she feels like I'm a nice person and does not want to casually date me. Another thing that she mentioned is that there's no rush, but for me I feel like there is sort of some urgency because I'm scared someone else will be interested in her. I told her its fine, but I wasn't sure where it suddenly came from since everything seemed so perfect.

Honestly, I thought she just lost interest, but she kept telling me she didn't (She's quite honest so I don't feel as there is a reason to lie). We overall talk less but she will still message me first in the mornings, but no so many replies during the day and night. I assume she's busy when she doesn't reply but I just saw her post on Instagram maybe 1 hour ago and I still haven't gotten a reply.

If she lost interest, why would she bother starting a convo with me and telling me she hasn't? If she hasn't lost interest, can someone really be busy to the point where they don't want to reply, but will post on Insta? I don't know. I sometimes feel like I should just move on, but I was so happy during that month. Move on? or give her some time? Please advise.

TL;DR: got close to someone recently, was going great until they stopped replying as much, said its because she's busy and not because she lost interest, will keep starting conversations with me then reply after many hours, but will post on Instagram during this time",relationships,Am I [25M] getting played by someone [31F]?

This is a long story riddled with bad choices, but try to bare with me. 
I met a girl when I was thirteen and she was seventeen. I kind of fell in love with her but the age difference and whatnot made it fizzle out before it even turned into anything at all. 
We met at a group therapy kind of thing and it wasn't ideal. 

Flash forward a couple of years:
I meet the love of my life at sixteen and get married as soon as I turned eighteen. We have lived together from the start and spent every single day together. We are still very happy together and have a set of twins who'll soon turn one. 
The issue began when I met my childhood love again and we picked up right where we left off, only older and a bit more experienced.
We have AMAZING chemistry, and it's crazy but somehow my husband fell in love with her too and we started living together as a happy family. The children love her and she absolutely adores them. She's very good with them. 

So everything was going great. Until it absolutely turned to shit. 
Her mental health declined rapidly seemingly out of nowhere and before I knew it I took care of her completely. 
She can't clean, cook, shower, brush her teeth, be trusted with ANY medications.
She's currently very very ill and comitted to a hospital, but I'm still getting her stuff and make sure she's okay etc.
Me and my husband moved out and removed the kids from the situation as soon as it started going downhill.
My husband was smart and jumped the ship and gave up on her immediatly and he is no longer interested in a future with her. 
I on the other hand have big troubles letting go. I love her, but I am a mother and a wife too.
I just can't seem to leave her. I need some tough love.

I've never done any kind of woodworking before, but for my friend's birthday I'd like to give him kind of a wood plaque (like this one: [https://www.trophykits.com/images/gt/PMA810-1.jpg](https://www.trophykits.com/images/gt/PMA810-1.jpg)), where I would paint over an achievement from his favorite game.

I don't know what's the best way to approach this, should I buy a plaque already done, or should I buy some wood and saw it down to the size I want? I don't know where to buy any of this.

Do you need to sand the wood? I heard you need to apply primer before using paint? What kind of paint should I use? 

I'm trying to keep it as cheap as possible, but I want it to look good.

t2_9k2hk,1553553140.0,b5hhxz,t3_b5hhxz,5,"Hey, everyone, quick recap, I got a Delta Model 10 contractor's saw last fall from CL. I have the top in decent condition, made my first cut the other day, determined I need to align the blade with the miter tracks but I think I know how to do that now etc. etc.

For Christmas, my wife got me the Bench Dog cast iron router table extension wing and my son and I replaced the left wing with it last week. I need to do a little final alignment with it but that looks good.

When I installed it, I removed the old wing from the saw which is a heavy steel thing. Here's a link to an eBay listing of perhaps not my exact model year but approximately my saw. [Delta Contractor Saw](https://www.ebay.com/itm/DELTA-ROCKWELL-Model-10-034-Contractor-SAW-34-440-Baldor-2HP-Motor-EXTENSION-WINGS-/331595184780?nma=true&amp;si=dLQyN9T3mcPrud5qv5i%252Fyk6l0LM%253D&amp;orig_cvip=true&amp;nordt=true&amp;rt=nc&amp;_trksid=p2047675.l2557)

I don't think it makes sense to attach the router extension on the far side of the wing, does it? It's super heavy, I think it would cause deflection in the steel wing. I'm pretty sure this is the right way to mount it.

However the router table extension wing does not have a place for the fence rails to re-attach.

So I can...

1. Leave them unattached. Perhaps not a terrible solution. At some point I'll replace the stock fence with a home-built or aftermarket fence in any case.
2. Drill holes in the sides of the RTEW to reattach the fence. Straightforward.
3. Move the fence to the right? Can I do that? I haven't measured the hole placements. I am considering attaching the second wing onto the first wing on the right but again I wonder if this is just a recipe for excessive deflection. But I could make a support which is what I would have to do for any other extended wing plan.

I saw a few videos on why you would put your fence on the left hand side of the blade and they seemed more like why you could do it, not why it's useful. (I mention this in relation to my option 3 above where I'm pondering moving my fence to the right, losing the ability to move it to the left of the blade.)

Again, thanks in advance.

I didn’t want to do the poll so ally  threatened if I didn’t she’ll slap me (she’s a bit violent but I like to think its in a friendly way). I didn’t want to get hurt so I did it. The poll showed that everyone voted no for her to get invited in to the group chat. There was a commotion over the results and Cassie knew she couldn’t get in to the group chat.

So when everyone left, it was just me, Cassie, ally and another guy let’s name Terrance in the same room. 

Cassie went up to ally and asked if everyone voted no. Ally freaked out and said she shouldn’t see the results. I didn’t want to be around more drama so me and the other guy left the room. 

When we came back, ally walked out of the room leaving me Terrance and Cassie. She starts to get aggressive and tried to make Terrance answer. He finally breaks and said everyone voted no. I felt bad so later on I changed my vote.

Ally got mad at me and Terrance for waking out on her and that Terrance told the vote results.

Now she’s ignoring us for the whole day. Is it justified for her to do that? 

Also in the morning I tried to strike up a conversation with her to try and forget about that petty commotion. She didn’t answer me. Instead she took out a packet of Oreos and offered everyone one except for me. I walked away. She’s also been ignoring Terrance. She didn’t tell us why she was mad at us. We had to ask her other friend.

Btw. I’ve known ally for almost 10 years now and every time we have an argument I’m the one who apologises and tries to make up. I don’t want to keep doing this.

So for starters, I haven't been much into the dating game in college. Since school keeps me busy I only really have had time, or made an effort, for one night stands usually after a night of partying. A few months back I hooked up with this girl at a party, we just kissed and danced for a while, I also got her snapchat. So flash forward to a few days ago (Monday of this week), I match with this girl on Tinder. I want to ask this girl out to dinner but idk how to do it.

t2_3hh32yll,1553612619.0,b5qrum,t3_b5qrum,120,"I don't know what to do /r/relationships. 

I've had a really terrible dating history and for the last 8 years have always dated people that showed any interest because I felt I wasn't worth much. It meant I dated people who felt cheating was my fault and people who just used me. I broke the cycle after finishing university and worked hard on myself. I got into my target grad school and have been really enjoying my studies over the last year. I even started dating. 

I met ""Cassie"" through colleagues. Her family is involved with the school I attend and we hit it off at various meetings. I took a mantra from my favorite filmmaker and said ""fuck it, fortune favors the bold!"" and asked her out. We ""dated"" for the first few months but have a much more serious relationship now. We spend a lot of time together - at each other's apartments- and do a lot of things together, including some travel after classes wrap up. 

All-in-all, she makes me feel great. We compliment each other's personalities, get along well and have a lot of fun together. We don't bring out the worst in each other but the best. We motivate each other in a lot of ways. Honestly, it's the happiest I've been in a relationship ever and I really can say that I love her. But... there is an issue. She has no life skills. 

She grew up very, very well-to-do and had no problem with accessing cash for her needs. Her parents have limited her financial resources as an adult and she has a lump sum she will get when her parents pass, but it's certainly not the kind of money that would allow us to do nothing for life. I like working and studying, and I worked so hard to get into this program that I'm going to make it worth it. 

I grew up somewhere in the ""upper middle class"" range and my mother taught me to cook, to sew and how to clean and fix things. I have cookbooks and enjoy experimenting with new recipes. I steam clean carpets when dirty and own a Dyson to keep the place clean. Cassie never learned to cook. Or to fix a button. Or to clean. It was done for her. When I say: ""she can't cook"" I mean she will put a pan on so high that any fat in the pan immediately scorches, sets off the alarm. She has a troubled history with making soup from a can and the last incident I've called ""The Lipton Disaster"" resulted in two stitches and a tetanus shot. 

She can make her bed, but even laundry is a struggle. Either everything goes into the dryer or she forgets to change settings. I've had sweaters come out the size of a doll's shirt and she's dyed a number of her own clothes, ruining them. I've tried to ""include"" her in certain tasks, like learning to make pasta, but she gets frustrated and gives up. She really enjoys the fruits of the stove and oven, but doesn't want to learn as it frustrates her. 

I really, really care about her. I love spending time with her and she's a really wonderful, caring person who does a lot of good. But, at home, there are a lot of things where she just doesn't hold-up her end. I end up doing a lot of things like cooking and cleaning on top of being in a really competitive program that doesn't care if your girlfriend can't make soup. I'm at a loss as to how to approach this. 

tl;dr GF never learned to cook or do laundry (among other things) so it falls to me. I'm really burned-out with my program and don't have a lot of free time.

We'd lived together for several years. Was going to marry ex, and still love them, but for the past year I realized that our needs and vision for the future differed drastically. We tried a lot of things, and we openly discussed every issue, but things didn't get better. We couldn't create what wasn't there to start with in the relationship. We ended things amicably, but ex is taking it harder than I am.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a mutual friend ('M') that I get along with. Ex and I have known M for same amount of time, but I know M through hobbies, ex knows them through work contexts. Towards the end of the relationship, hanging out with M did remind me of all the things that I didn't have in my previous relationship -- the playfulness, shared hobbies, large ambitions, and emotional connection, etc.  Helped me realize that my ex and I wouldn't even be friends if we hadn't met on a dating app. Things were ever ONLY platonic with M; I made it very clear when I was with my ex that I was strictly monogamous.

&amp;#x200B;

M and I usually play sports together regularly but after the breakup M went and didn't ask me (which is odd), despite saying that they still wanted to keep hanging out w/me and doing stuff together. Sportsball is the core of our friendship so this is weird. I am treating them exactly like how I used to, and they even said they still wanted to go to these events we'd planned together.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have many people to go out with, only three friends whom I can see around once a week at most due to scheduling conflicts. Used to hang out with M 3/4 times a week, so I'm really feeling their absence in my life.

I've deleted all social media and said friend's contact information. Because I don't want to crowd them; they're probably feeling sandwiched btwn ex and I. But how do I back away without making it seem like I don't want to be friends anymore? I'm also coming to terms with the fact that I am romantically interested in M and ideally would want to pursue them in the future (I feel like a shitty human being), but NO WAY am I in the right state or time to pursue ANYONE at this moment regardless of how I feel about them.

I’d tell her my problems like she was my therapist and expect her to fix it. Any small issue of mine would be the end of the world to me. She was babying me. That’s unattractive. 


She said she sometimes felt like she would upset me if she said she had to do something or go somewhere. She should be able to live her independent life and I trust that she’s not doing anything.

Although I do think she has some instances that have happened that she hasn’t told me because she knew I’d be upset. Like her talking to guys at parties, even if it’s just casual. However 
She started to resent me because I didn’t realize I was co dependent and she didn’t tell me. We did not have a healthy relationship at all.

He works a job in the summer that makes him ~30k in 3-4 months but since that ended last fall he has been trying to find work. He does carpentry/home repairs in the fall/winter/spring, and has done some odd jobs here and there with that but does not have a contractor license and does not want to start from the bottom in order to get it. He has since stopped that type of work and is now trying to find a job in the field that he works in in the summer for the spring/fall months. He also has social anxiety, so any sort of negative thing to happen to him while trying to find a job will make him feel completely useless. There are days where he is at home and does nothing to further his career.

I know he is frustrated too and he wants to find a job but at times I feel like he just isn't trying enough. At this point, I just want him to find a job doing ANYTHING and then he can continue working towards the actual field he wants on the side, but he just doesn't want to work a minimum wage job. He says for the field he's trying to work in that it's all about the people you know, and he has no friends. So it turns into him feeling sorry for himself because he doesn't have any friends (he does, just not any particularly close ones). He feels like people don't like him and it seems to just stop him from trying.

The problem is every month that the mortgage is due (a house I bought myself a month or so after his summer job ended) I just have this load of stress on whether or not he will actually have any money to give me AND if I bring up him needing to send me rent it's 50/50 on whether he will start to be annoyed and go into a bad mood. It's like stepping on eggshells talking about bills being due. He says he makes 30k in the summer (we are long distance during this time, and he usually sends me about 1 month worth of rent despite me asking him to send me it every month), but I'm not actually sure where this money goes if he can't afford around 1k a month to the mortgage/other bills. It has turned into me paying all of the utilities/groceries/etc and him paying half the mortgage. The only other payments he has is a car payment and one semester worth of student loans. I am financially very stable, and can afford to pay everything on my own but I just wouldn't have as much financial freedom as I would want. I graduated college not too long ago and have a well paying job, so I'm in a stage of my life where I would like to spend my extra money on travel and experiences, but with the uncertainty of his payments I don't feel like I should be doing that. It's very hard, because all I want is a partner that I can enjoy life with but instead I'm constantly stressed about what our future holds because he is essentially financially dependent on me.

I love him very much, and the thought of not being with him is something I don't want to consider, but I sometimes think about how it would be if we werent together. Also, I'm not sure what he would do if we were to break up. He would have to move back in with his mom and I just feel like leaving him would really mess up his life.

I guess I'm looking for advice as to how I can talk to him about this and how I can be less selfish while I support him on his journey. Any time I try to help it turns into him feeling sorry for himself and me having to comfort him or him getting angry and us fighting. I'm just getting really tired of everything.

My boyfriend and I, both in our mid 20s are together for four years. There has been an issue with a female co worker of his for over two years. He hang out at her house in secret 1.5 yrs ago, I found out much later. He claims nothing happens. They still work together and text sometimes, but less frequent. He swears he won't hang out with her - she has send inappropriate texts and such.

We live together in our own house. I leave every monday morning to another city and come back thursday morning for work issues. This means he is alone for 24 hours.

This thursday morning 10am I got out of the bus and saw that girl walking to the bus. We live in a small craphole place, with nothing to do. We have a supermarket, a bakery, one tiny clothing store and that is it. This girl lives in another city, works in another city and studies in another city. I know she has NO friends or family in our town, because she mentioned it earlier to my boyfriend. (""You are the only one I know that wants to live in that crap place!"")

So. What was her reason to be there, so early in the morning? I came home and my boyfriend was in bed asleep, with the window and curtains open. He always sleeps with the window and curtains closed. Also his jacket lay on the floor near the door. We live together for 4 months and his jacket never laid on the floor before.

So..I confronted and he said she was not there and has never been to our house. Then I decided to check his internet history. Yes, fellow redditors, I know this is wrong but I do NOT want a rant about this - I know how much Redditors want to burn alive people who do this. I checked it. It was a mistake. I know. Please no rant about how bad it is or how my relationship is doomed already.

So I saw that the evening before he watched some netflix on his tablet until 11PM. After that, things get weird. He watched youtube on his mobile from 11.00 to 11.19 PM. This is odd, because I am with this guy for 4 years and he NEVER watches youtube on his phone when he is inside the house. He always only does this when he is in the bus, outside or whatever.

He set up an alarm clock at 22.59 PM. 

The first next activity was next day 08.04 am when he put off his alarm clock, and then 08.30 on Whatsapp.

He has a car that he shares with his mom. Wednesday we got into the car and he said; Mom keeps asking bout the car and drives my fuel till its empty. And I said; no she didn't asked for the car for at least 2 weeks why you bring this up? He just said oh it bothers me.

He kept bringing up this girl a couple of times. ""I don't think it was her, I think you saw it wrong. Probably can't be her"" blah blah.  So, fellow Redditors. What do you think of his behavior and signals?

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for about a year now. I knew since the start that she was bisexual and it's never really bothered me until recently. I'm not sure why its just now bothering me, but I've noticed that she constantly fawns over girls with a type of excitement she doesn't ever show me. It can be video game characters, characters on TV, or actual people, but if there's a girl she thinks is cute, she makes sure to let me know. She'll literally squeal if she sees a cute girl. It makes me feel insecure and unattractive because the only time she ever shows such excitement is with people that look nothing like me. It doesn't help that she'll sometimes reblog posts that say something like 'God All Women are Hot, Not like men.' She's noticed it as well, and has noticed me being uncomfortable with it. She said it made her feel like she had to hide her sexuality from me. I'd be just as uncomfortable if she was fawning over guys, and I'm sure she wouldn't like it if I told her repeatedly that I love how girls with blonde hair and light skin looked (she has black hair and tan skin).

Am I being unreasonable? Should I just get over it?

I don't want to go into the unreasonable family expectations structure in the middle east but to explain why I can't just ""cut her off"" as much as I would love to: It would mean going into a mental war against my family members who will all use their time and energy to guilt me, then potentially we'd be cut off (but never completely where I can just breathe easy).   So in my case, the best action I have decided to take is calculate everything I have decided to honor as help.  Which will be x amount of months and x amount of bills given to her in cash every 6 months, so she gets into the habit of money management, if she squanders that money, I will use it as leverage and simply tell any one who complains to pitch in themselves because the money I pledged is all the money I have for her.** 

**I have decided to wait until the beginning of next week and send her a detailed email with my decision , it will be neutral and and it will be factual.**   


  
It's a very long story but I will try to be brief and clear.  
**\[background\]**We are currently 4 sisters (middle eastern if that matters) no male siblings, and we live in a sponsorship-based country - that means if your residence permit isn't sponsored by work/spouse/a business partner you cannot stay in the country.My parents left after my father was forced to retire.

**\[Background about the sisters\]**The first -1S (eldest sister) runs her own business that is struggling. We had a very turbulent relationship but we established reasonable boundaries.Me- left my stressful job to become a teacher for my sanity (believe me, I am much better! My language students are around undergrad level) - for context, my sisters never approved me taking this job as they saw it ""less"".The second middle sister 2Y- Generally controlling and judgmental, likes to spend money she doesn't have, measures love with things and how much emotional labor you're giving her. we haven't spoken as much since her husband took a job in Europe, she is currently unemployed.The youngest YST (the one in question) is currently working full time in a PR agency of some sort that is abusing her, and ended up paying new comers more than what she got, we were (forced) roommates for about a year. (greatly contributed to my depression and stress with work). As she was a high achiever in college, they contacted her about a masters degree with a guaranteed scholarship that covers half her tuition costs.

**\[Elaboration on the roommate situation\]**The  YST was mostly staying at the 2Y's home when she wasn't at college. and she would have stayed full time if  2Y stayed in the country. She has been living vicariously through YST by not setting any boundaries(going out at late hours, questionable people, spending money on unnecessary things\*.)  which often has put me in conflict with her when she moved in with me.

I had found a job in the same city as Y2 and YST and was preparing to leave my parents' home as we were counting down to dad's retirement. Somehow the conversation took a turn where everyone was expecting me to have YST with me. No one asked me, and 1S kept insisting that we ""should stick together"". Neither YST nor myself wanted this arrangement. Especially when she wasn't going to pay a dime. When I finally addressed the situation with the family, I was accused of being selfish and that I was aiming to go wild and do whatever.. (middle eastern parents concerns)

It was miserable, a lot of emotional labor on my part, and wasn't neither financially easy nor emotionally rewarding, I was forced to pick a location that would work for YST with tons of pressure from 2Y, I got manipulated and ended up in that situation anyway.

She didn't make any effort to talk, and all my effort to socialize  were shut down, I thought I should have given her space, but then I saw she was laughing her heart out when speaking to our Y2 on skype. Of course I was responsible for all the bills, food shopping and other general needs at home.

My job was physically demanding and was at least 10 hours a day so when I got home I often had to choose between sleep food, and showering. But to her  was just ""grumpy"" I have tried speaking to her and clarifying our situation to improve our communication but it always ended up in me promising things and her not even apologizing.

I had to often get her permission and plan weeks in advance if I wanted to have my BF (now my husband) over. And of course, she decided she hated him because he would stand up to her and not let her walk over him. She of course transmitted a very negative image to 2Y (who on a brief meeting when she was constantly criticizing me for driving, things I wear, things I talk about in front of him - he of course defended me and that caused her to hate him as well. ) which is what she was willing to receive.Never mind it was MY flat, My rent and my space. but none of that mattered.  Of course I couldn't ask her to move out, because my entire family would get involved and would have risked at the time me seeing my BF.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Marriage and moving out\]**

I got married to my BF (In September), Y2 and YST made the wedding about them, offered no help in preparation or finances (despite me at that time still paying for rent) and they judged me for buying a dress that didn't cost an arm and leg. and for trying to save money in general. My husband paid for the majority of the wedding, and we were forced to hold about 10 places for YST friends who never showed up, yet we still paid for their dinners. they didn't apologize and neither did she.

When I confirmed that I was getting married, I encouraged YST to take the Masters degree offer and potentially increase her salary (if not by double), she was worried about the living situation, so I made a decision after speaking with my husband (And he was wonderfully amazingly supportive) that I will continue to pay the rent until she's done paying for her masters degree.

So I was paying the rent for a studio I wasn't allowed to visit without prior plans or permission (when I was in the city and had to stay overnight, she got all pissy with me even when I had asked her days in advance, she claimed I didn't ask- luckily it was on the family group on whatsapp. I also picked up the internet bill and the water and electricity.

**\[the now- moving out and total lack of gratitude\]**Now that the contract is running out (and after several visits to a therapist to resolve the misplaced guilt and responsibility ) I have decided to give her ample time and tell her I cannot afford the same amount (as my salary is lower).

She agrees and doesn't do anything else from then. every time I had to initiate the conversation, she makes no effort to talk to me otherwise. I had to ask about exact dates (when will she graduate , when does she finish her payments...etc)

every time I contacted her, she would act like I greatly inconvenienced her, I decided to not let it get to me and focus on facts: I cannot afford an expensive rent, I will continue to honor my engagement, she needs to move out soon because I am in a different city and cannot do that for her.

I had planned to pay up to June 2020 when she finished her payments but added 6 months to give her time to start saving for the December 2020 rent.  I have also told her that I will pay the bills only until June 2020 .

I decided to share the plan in advance because she has the habit of complaining that I never give her enough time - generally ignores me until I highlight the conversation again.

&amp;#x200B;

***Me: Hey YST, I forgot to tell you that I have also factored in 6 months after your final university cheque, that way you can start saving from June for your December rent.   As for the bills, I will pay up to June. What do you think?***

***Me: \*Shares also the excel sheet with detailed dates and amount\****

***Yst: What?***

***Me (getting upset, not a thank you no nothing...and after so many unsent texts) : June 2020.***

***YST: Let me get closer to the graduation dateI don't want more stress to think about todayLet's meet soonAnd discuss All this***

I am upset (not surprised) by her entitled manner, I want to respond back and I have to much to say .. thing is it is not a venting thing where she's hearing how I feel for the first time, it is something that she always used to avoid any conversation ""I am too stressed for this... too stressed for that"". that's exactly how we ended u in arguments where she accused me of not giving her enough heads up.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in another city and I cannot drive the distance (that's another funny story that never made it onto TIFU) . I know she will not take the time to come down to see me. and she clearly indicated that she has no intention of resolving the matter in a timely manner.She has always taken my help without directly asking for it but still made my life miserable by ignoring me or criticizing me  and generally making our interactions undesirable when I ""don't read between the lines to help"" . Throughout all the time (even back when she was in college, I paid for her dorm and a lot of her expenses, not to mention expensive birthday gifts) I never got a genuine act of gratitude, neither verbal nor other.

I am going to stand my ground, X amount is all I can afford and she will have to deal with it.However, How should I proceed? Should I insist on a time to meet and insist she meets me in my city?Should I just let it sit for now ? Is it even worth telling her that I actually extended my help and rather than a thank you I get the usual "" I am too stressed""?

Thank you all for taking the time to read through...

I’ve always had a shaky relationship with my mom, and when my therapist called it abusive I decided to move out last year. A lot of my friends were so supportive and offered me to love wth them but I chickened our and stayed home.

Last month I finally decided to move out but all my friends have moved in with a bf/gf or don’t want to be my roomate.
Although they still ask to hang out with me and are happy to text I feel so rejected. If no one want something to be my roomate do they really want to be my friend?

In terms of mental health, I went through my periods of depression, suicide attempts, etc. and am glad to say I am 100% past this. But, any woman that I seem to get close to or fall for seem to not be stable mentally. Am I unreasonable for wanting to be with someone who is not depressed, or is at least actively working to get out of it. I’m empathetic, truly, but it seems at times to bring me back to a place I no longer want to be at.

Also, I’m not the best at communication. I’ll talk with somebody for hours at a time, especially a significant other, but I hate texting/snap/whatever. And say I’m really busy studying for a big exam sometimes I won’t respond for hours because I don’t even look at my phone. Girlfriends will always get upset. Going into every relationship I have voiced that this occurs and warn her, but they always seem surprised and hurt. 

Maybe I’m just scatter brained right now because I am conflicted, but is it too much to want to be with someone who’s more stable mentally and allows a bit more personal freedom without being hurt?

Also i’m gonna do this to make it less confusing to read. We’ll call big little sister Jessica, and lil little sister Kennedy

I think I’ve always been closer to Kennedy, because our personalities just go together and we just get along super well. After I visited them last summer, she became like one of my best friends, which at first I thought it was weird cause the age difference (still kinda do. Is it?) but oh well. Shouldn’t I be closer to Jessica since there isn’t as big of an age gap? I dunno. 

Anyways, last summer when I was there, I didn’t have much 1 on 1 time with the Jessica, and she got kinda upset about that. I pretty much hung out with Kennedy the entire time, and that almost happened this time too (though it seems like since then, the Jessica has just accepted that i’m just closer with the Kennedy,) but the last night I was there, Kennedy fell asleep early so I figured I’d go to her room and talk with Jessica. We talked about some deep shit and pulled an all nighter, and she told me some really terrible stuff that i literally did not know. I tried to put the thought that anything that she was saying could be a lie to the back of my mind, but i deadass caught her in a lie while we were talking and called her out for it, and now i honestly don’t know what is or isn’t true. Would she really make some of that shit up? Still haven’t talked to her much since but still have talked to the lil one every day. 

This lying thing has been going on for as long as I can remember. Jessica would always make up stories and way over-exaggerate things. It was never that big of a deal when we were younger, but as I’ve gotten older, it’s really annoying, especially since we’re having more mature conversations and I’m trying to build a closer relationship with her. I texted her a couple weeks ago asking her a question, and she brought up that she stole her dads car and went to panera to work on a project. I was hesitant to believe her because, reasons, and I asked Kennedy if that was real when we facetimed and she started dying laughing. She said no and they dropped her off at panera. Kennedy texted the messages about the car thing to Jessica and she said something like “stop i’m just trying to be cool.”

What should i do? How can I build a relationship with Jessica, cause I know it hurts her that I’m not as close with her as I am with Kennedy. Also how can I stop her lying issue?

My boyfriend got a new job and starts Monday. He works in collision repair (fixes cars that get in accidents) and gets paid based on the work he gets. So a vehicle comes in, manager assigns to one of the employees , he gets paid based on how many hours insurance says it should take to repair. 

His current job is a terrible employer. Among many other terrible practices, they give most of the work to his coworker (he's one of two techs there) because the guy complains too much, so they give him work to shut him up. So getting this new job is super exciting! 

I told him we should take a long weekend between his two jobs... take thursday and friday off and go somewhere new and fun! De-stress a bit! Well, he's been dragging his feet, like he ALWAYS does when I try to plan a vacation. It doesn't matter if it's a week long or just a long weekend. He only has 2 weeks vacation and we do take one week to go on an annual cabin trip with my family where he's able to fish all week. The other 5 days always go to hunting. 

Here's the kicker... he's taken unpaid days off for hunting and for being overly hungover. But he WILL NOT take days off, paid or unpaid to go somewhere with me. I try to make it more appealing to him too, like I wanted to go to Maine last year, where we could eat a bunch of seafood (his favorite) and even go on a fishing trip. But in the end he ""couldn't take the time off"". He doesn't even ask his employer, he just says he can't take the time off. I know he can afford to,  he just won't. It's SO FRUSTRATING!

He definitely can't take tomorrow off, and doesn't think he can get everything done in time to leave by tomorrow night (he has a tool box he has to bring to the new place once he's done). So... I told him im going somewhere by myself. I still have NO CLUE where i'm going. I've never been on any sort of trip by myself, so I can't decide if I should wait for him and leave possibly not until friday morning, or if I should just head out on the road and find somewhere to go by myself...???!!!

I've always thought he was cute and fun to be around, but for the past month, two months, I don't see him the same, physically and mentally. I'm not sexually attracted to him at all and I focus on his internal flaws. He's lazy, a mama's body, no backbone, immature, not smart, can't take care of himself, etc. We are semi-long distance so I only see him every other weekend and I avoid the bedroom at all costs because I'm pretty grossed out thinking of doing anything sexual.

He's trustworthy, nice, he always tells me he loves me/misses me, etc. I still care for him a lot and considering breaking up with him hurts my heart, but even thinking about kissing him for longer than five seconds makes me go through a ""ew, cooties"" phase again. I'm also a really introverted person. In the past, I enjoyed spending time with him all the time despite being very introverted, but now, I just want to be alone.

Sometimes I think that is what's causing my problem and I tell myself that I should just wait it out, but I feel like that is unfair to him.

I (17M) swore into the Marine Corps just over a month ago. My girlfriend of almost a year (18f) broke up with me because she doesn't like the fact that I'm joining the military and going away. Last month (1 month post breakup) I started really hitting it off with another girl (18f) I know and I asked her out. She said she'd think about it, but after a week of thinking about it, she said no for the same reason my girlfriend broke up with me previously. Do y'all think it's a waste of time to pursue any further relationships until I am fully into the Marines and at my first duty station? I was fully ready and willing to make a long distance thing work with either of these girls and the first one I actually had a long distance relationship over the summer as I went out of state to work. Any input as to whether I should just wait or not would be greatly appreciated and I'll be happy to include any extra details, just gotta ask.",relationships,I (17M) can't keep or get into a relationship since I swore in.

He’s tripped 8 times, last year he did it 4 times within the span of every 2 months. He’s about to take it again and I’m tired of it...I have to tripsit him, I have to tripsit his friends, and if I don’t he gets upset with me. So I have to sit for up to 10 hours making sure nothing goes wrong. Act like I’m not upset that he’s taking it but he’s really good at indicating when I’m upset. Trust me I love him so much and I want to be with him for the rest of my life but I don’t want to be with acid taking him. I REALLY can’t do this anymore, it drains my body physically and mentally. I never thought I’d go out with someone who likes drugs. Maybe alcohol and weed but this is a hard no for me. I’ve been with him for 5 years and we’re in a great place. The only problem is acid. He said he doesn’t plan on taking it for the rest of his life but he’s not giving me an age. Honestly I get it, we’re 20 and he wants to have fun, but he’s never even had an amazing trip like he expects. I would love it if he stopped and didn’t want to take it anymore but I have a feeling he doesn’t want to for another probably 5 years. I’m just at a loss because I don’t know how to put my foot down and say enough taking it, and I also don’t want to be controlling. I don’t want to break up with him over it at all, I just want him to stop. I don’t know why him taking it takes a toll on my body and mind, it does though. And I don’t know what to do...

Am I right to feel this way? How do I talk to him about this and get him to realize I’m serious?

If you guys have any questions please ask!

Hi all, long time-first time. I'm very much a novice woodworker, although I've learned much about the trade from this subreddit. I am building a church mailbox system for my church, and if I could go back and change everything from the beginning, I would. I understand the method I used to create the dividers was poorly planned, it's much stronger than it needs to be, really all of it was poorly planned, but I've sunk too much time and money into this to restart. 

If you look at the pics, you'll see I decided to rout grooves into the back board, this way each divider would be equally spaced from the bottom row to the top row. My original plan was just to glue each divider into the groove and pray for the best, but I realized this was dumb and wouldn't last. My next solution was to rip quarter inch ply down and create slots in those to hold the dividers from the front as well. That's seemed to be a pretty good solution. 

My quandary is this: how should I attach these quarter inch ply boards to the shelves? I would like to just glue and be done with it, but my concern is for individual dividers. If one breaks or warps, I would like to replace it. My other idea would be to insert threaded inserts into each shelf at the ends and attach the front quarter inch slotted pieces using a fastener. But the problem there is that I have 6"" of clearance between shelves, and I'm not sure how to drill the holes. 

Again, I would restart if I could, but I simply can't. If anyone has a solution I'm not thinking of, I'm all ears. Thank you for your time. Please be nice! (retreats behind mammoth mailbox system)",woodworking,Requesting Advice

I have been seeing this girl for a while now, also \[F24\] and she is really nice and things seem to be going well. However there is an issue, and I believe that this issue lies with me, more than her.

&amp;#x200B;

She used to be overweight many years ago before I ever met her, very obese in fact. Over the course of years of difficult diet and exercise she is now down to a very respectable weight. I was incredibly surprised to learn of what she used to be like and barely even recognise her in any of her old pictures. She has done incredibly and you could never ask for anything more from her. The problem is the side effect of dramatic weight loss: loose skin, she suffers from it over quite a bit over her whole body and her feminine figure is quite lost because of it. I keep thinking about it all the time, it sticks out and I cant help but notice it. When she is well dressed and covered up she looks perfect, it's only when she wears less that it becomes apparent.

&amp;#x200B;

I really hate myself for feeling like this because she is a good person who has worked so damn hard. I feel like such a shallow bastard but it weighs heavy on my mind. Whenever I see other women in public I can't help but be drawn to their slim, beautiful figures. I find them hypnotising and I feel a strong sense of stress and guilt when I feel like this. I just can't stop these thoughts and feelings. Could it also be that years of pornography consumption is also playing a role in feeling like this? Has my view of women been somewhat warped? Should I quit porn and only masturbate whilst thinking of her to 'trick' myself? Or is it perhaps because the dating world is just so god damn difficult for men that I just want to try and hold onto any one because they are actually showing an interest and making an effort?

&amp;#x200B;

I wrestle all the time with my primal male brain over this issue and I'm afraid of it becoming a real problem. I'm hoping somebody here can say SOMETHING that will help although I feel that isn't really possible.

However, I happened to see recently that she's been talking to her ex-boyfriend. I have no idea what they've talked about but I see they've exchanged pictures, and those aren't damning but I feel its still inappropriate. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is some history with the ex-boyfriend that has impacted our relationship. In the beginning of our relationship we were long distance. I would see her for a week every few weeks or so. One of the weeks I was away she was in the same room as her ex-boyfriend, they got drunk and they wound up having sex. Their emotional affair continued for at least one month. One of the times I was there with her I saw the text conversations they had and confronted her. She broke down and claimed to want to be with me, she can see it clearly now. I guess you can say I was weak and went with it. A few months after this happened, still with me seeing her every other week or so, I finally am able to move to be with her.

&amp;#x200B;

From that point on it seemed as though we had worked on things and came closer. She wasn't talking to anyone - that I knew about at least - and things seemed to be going well. I grew closer to her sons. Fast forward to mid-December. We've been living together for about 7 months at this point when I see she's talking to a different ex. She says its just as friends and he has no one to talk to. She shows me most of their conversation. I wound up snooping and see it became inappropriate - he saying he still loves and she not really shutting him down. This continues through New Years. Late January this year I see she's talking to the ex she cheated on me with, which no matter I feel is completely wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned earlier I'm in love with her and I'm pretty sure she is with me. I don't know if this is attention seeking behavior or what. Unfortunately I feel like I need to move on before this continues. Am I justified there? How would I even go about doing this? From the outside looking in I'm sure its as simple as saying ""dump her and move on"", I just can't seem to bring myself to do that because of the connection or whatever it may be that I have with her.

We dated for 6 years. Her mother hated me - for not valid reasons, without getting into it, I came from a broken family so she thought I would never make a good husband.
Eventually it lead to our relationships demise, she would hear it from her mom EVERY SINGLE DAY and instead of being an adult and living her life the way she wanted, she took it to heart and took it out on our relationship. Although we had plans to marry and live OUR life they never came to fruitation no matter how hard i tried. At one point it seemed it we COULD - I even had the ring ready.


Her mom wanted her to marry a guy of her liking (her as in her moms liking). My ex was devastated when I started dating my current girlfriend. She found out and would call me every day trying to meet up. I never met up. She entered the dating world before I did.


I just found out she got engaged. (Not to the same guy she was with 6 months ago but that shouldn't matter). I've moved on to a better relationship. Why do I feel broken after hearing this? I'm absolutely devastated. I don't regret my current relationship, far from it actually, I'm soooo deeply in love with my girlfriend, so then why is my ex getting engaged affecting me so negatively?

t2_mo4qm,1553704766.0,b66fly,t3_b66fly,5,"So as the title suggests, I'm thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend of 3.5 years for a different man. Right now I feel like I need to make a decision between the both of them because it wouldn't be fair to anyone if I was dating two people at the same time. I also don't want to be rushed into making the wrong decision but I need some outside opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend (M22), let's call him X, has always been there to support me and comfort me in my times of need and also just there as a friend when I need help or someone to talk to. We were inseparable for the first two-ish years of our relationship and then I got depressed. My reaction is just to be angry and push everyone away but even when I treated X badly, he always stayed by my side. I thought it was, and still could be, the worst thing in the world to lose him because we love eachother so much. However, like with most relationships, we needed more excitement so we decided to try out one of his kinks, cucking. Basically, I was allowed to go and flirt and be with other menand he wasn't allowed to be with anyone; I had all the power with choosing who and when I was with a person, whether it be sexual or not. So we tested that out and for a while with one or two people and everything was great, I had no attachment problems or any doubts until I met the other man (M27), let's call him Y. X and I were also starting to doubt our relationship around this time but we talked it out and set out to make some changes in our relationship. I was mainly looking for more attention because he was busy with school a lot which is understandable to an extent. I felt like I was always being pushed to the side and this was probably also the reason why I seeked attention from other men. Even when X and I do spend time together, I feel like it's not as fun and on more of like a friendship level because of my feelings for the other man. I miss the excitement I get when I look at X and wanting to hang out all the time; now it's more like if we both have time then we'll hang out. Maybe this is because we've been dating a while and we're comfortable with eachother but when we talked about our relationship and set out to make things different, I don't think he's trying. I said I wanted more attention and to be taken care of down to the little things (like picking up his clothes from my room, leaving trash out, leaving lights on...) which are all minute things but it's just the fact of me having to say these things to him and remind him over and over again it gets old. He also doesn't have his liscence yet which is not the end of the world but it's aggrivating when I've been telling him all these years to get it and he still hasn't yet.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, like me, Y is much more considerate by doing things without me even asking for them and that X wouldn't pick up on unless I asked for help or acknowledgement (like carrying a heavy bag I'm clearly struggling with or opening doors etc.) to name a few and making a huge effort to see me more. Y is a full time commuter student on weekdays, drives an hour each way to and from class, has a full time job as a paramedic, studies for his classes, yet still makes time to see me and to make that time enjoyable for the both of us. I see him and am instantly attracted becuase we have the same personalities, mostly the same likes and dislikes, similar majors and career paths and I feel like Y can take care of me more. Y is also older than X so they obvioulsy are at different stages of their life but I would want to feel like more of a partner to someone, like I do with Y, instead of feeling like their mother, like I do with X because I'm cleaning up after him and nagging at him to do chores or schoolwork or whatever. 

&amp;#x200B;

This whole thing makes me feel guilty because I never do things for myself let alone things that would make me happy. Right now, I feel happier with Y but am scared to make a commitment because of my depression and other problems. I feel more comfortable with X because we have been dating so long and I built him into my future but now thats slowly changing. It also makes me feel guilty because I feel like the way I'm talking about this makes it sound like I've made a decision and I just don't want to acknowledge it. I also know that potentially breaking up with X will be one of the hardest things I do because I still love him but I think its time for something better for myself so I simply want to ignore it but I can't keep doing this.

t2_10oleod4,1553650285.0,b5yahq,t3_b5yahq,11,"So basically I dated a girl for 5 years and we broke up like 3 years ago. I like her a lot but am pretty much over it given the that it's been so long ago. Things we're pretty great honestly and it was a smooth relationship. Honestly could have seen myself marrying her if I didn't make a few mistakes. What I'm not over is the circumstances of our break up and I wish I could just erase that period of my life completely. This is strange but basically I smoked too much weed one day and had a crazy melt down. I was thinking I was dying, acting totally belligerent, etc. It basically triggered a  few months with OCD. I've always had OCD and anxiety but it was to a crazy level for these few months. I would think I was dying, act crazy, call ambulances, etc. Until I was finally hospitalized. I tried to hide it mostly because I could tell she was super uncomfortable, which honestly only made my OCD worse. Anyways she broke up with me while I was in the hospital, which I don't blame her. But I am so fucking embarrassed, still to this day. Whenever I hear someone bad mouthing their ex all I can think about is how I probably take the cake and it just hurts me a lot. After we broke up I tried to say how sorry I was and she would be like ""it's ok, that's not why I ended it and I don't think any less of you"". I just have trouble accepting that and ik I made a lot of mistakes after we broke up, acted a little possessive, etc. I never asked for her back but I did cross the line a few times, which again I really regret. It was my first relationship, so I really didn't know how to handle myself. I just wish she could see me now that I'm better and ""normal"", so the last thing she sees of me isn't some crazy weirdo... But obviously that won't happen. I don't talk to her and it would be even more strange to bring it up randomly  I don't know what to do, it's hard getting over.

We've been together off/on for about 4 years and every time we've broken up is because of her selfish actions. I am in no ways perfect but I've always been the one to break up with her. 

She'll cancel plans at the last minute with me to hang out with her friends, and she will always come up with a BS excuse like she ""forgot"" or her friends ""pressured"" her. And BS excuses like that really trigger me. Most recently I had to go to work and she wanted to hangout. I told her I had to work but she can stop by my job (which is 30 min away and pretty chill) and we could talk, and her excuse was she ""didn't feel like it."" She then decided to talk shit about me to a mutual friend who later turned around and told me how she felt neglected that I'm choosing work over her.

t2_3hkh8efs,1553655273.0,b5z4ig,t3_b5z4ig,4,"I am in a LDR with a girl (about 4 hours away due to school and work stuff). I have no idea why I am so jealous of her ex. With the last girl I basically dated, I didn't care at all. Hell, I took her to places and parties where her ex was at, and I literally didn't care for a second. She ended up cheating on me basically with her ex, but that didn't even bother me that much (probably because I was only into her to make myself feel good, kiss, etc.). So, with this new girl being my first true love, it is hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that she loved someone before me. It also doesn't help that she is the one I lost my virginity to. So I think that makes me feel like our relationship is more important to me than it is for her.

A little background: Her ex broke up with her because he was moving a few hours away for a new job. This was super difficult for her because they were in a relationship for 8 years. When she first told me about this, he came back to town and she was freaking out because she didn't want to see him. But now about 9 months after their breakup, they are just friends. She has seen him twice since we starting talking (in a big group of people because they still have the same friend group) but she swears they are just friends. I truly believe her and I know she would never cheat or anything like that. She said he will always be a special person to her (which is understable because it her first love, they had been together for forever, etc). However, I think I feel insecure because I feel like if he wanted her back she would go back to him (because they have shared so many memories together, dated for so long, she was the one that got broken up with so I feel like she still wanted him). So it makes me feel like I'm on an unfair playing field with someone that is pretty much significantly more important than our 4 months dating.

In her bedroom, I found something with his name on it (which I saw her put away when I noticed it). Then she was showing me her yearbook pictures and I found a drawing of them two together. I wasn't snooping, but it hurts to see that she was with someone else before me and still has things things (which is understandable you can't just erase someone like that from your life). But it still hurts.

&amp;#x200B;

This girl makes me feel very loved and she is very special and amazing. I truly trust her with all of my heart. But I just feel insecure that she loved someone before me. IDK why but thoughts pop into my head of her having sex with her ex for the first, sharing those sorts of memories, etc. I want to be the person that she shared all of that with. Part of me feels like ""why would she want a LDR with me when her and her ex couldn't do one of a shorter distance. Is this her trying to tell her that it could've worked with him?"" Part of me feels judged when I meet her family and that I am always being compared to him. Especially when there are things that I Know she did with him in the past. Like how she goes to a ski trip every couple of years. She only tells me stories from the one 5 years ago from when she went with her best friend. She has been there twice since but obviously it was with her ex. So part of me doesn't want to do that with her since that's something she has done with her ex. I want to do new stuff with her.

Normally I am not like this but idk why this one affects me so much. I have only seen one picture of him. I found his social media and thinking about looking through it. I feel like if I find him to be unattractive, weird, etc. it will make me feel better like that I'm better than him (ik this is a horrible thing to say hahaha). But also, my gf was a little heavier when she was with him so that also makes me feel better (wow I'm actually a terrible person fml).

&amp;#x200B;

I have talked to my gf a couple of times before and she says don't be jealous, it's not a big deal, etc. She says this in a very good and sincere way so I don't want to talk to her again about it because it's going to make me look very jealous. Any advice on dealing with this? Would it be a bad idea to go through her social media? Thank you so much in advance.

t2_3hmmzrdv,1553668727.0,b612b0,t3_b612b0,2,"So I met my boyfriend 5 years ago when I was 15 and he was 17/18 and we have been together for almost four years now. We met through friends at a party and had made out - all innocent and stuff but we were super keen on each other. 
Before the relationship started I wasnt overly ready to be a “thing” as I was too young to be seeing a boy and I have a pretty strict family, fair enough considering my age at the time.
However I was interested in him despite try to take things super slow - but not telling him this due to not wanting to seem like an immature 15 year old who isn’t allowed to do anything or doesn’t have experience. 

At the time he was a v and so was I (yet I wasn’t going to directly tell him this). I would always muck around and pretend I knew lots. 

Anyway at the start of the relationship I found out that he had a friends with benefits with an older girl after we met. Now this is where it gets confusing as he believes I wasn’t interested in him and we weren’t looking like we were going to be together. However! I thought this was a big deal and that we were practically seeing each other as he had asked me out a few times (i had said ask me out properly- at least put a little effort in and I’ll say yes, which he ended up doing a few months later- literally wrote a nice message that’s all- I’m not that high maintenance). 

Furthermore everyone knew - even one of my closest friends but she kept it from me and to make matters worse this girl he had fwb with ended up bullying me- in fact still tries to. It was a very messy situation and it never really got resolved, he just didn’t say much about it and pretended it didn’t happen, which probably didn’t help the situation much. 

I also found out later in the relationship that he had a number of hookups and what not at the same time when I thought we were exclusive and he denied them. Yes everyone says I should just get over it and move on but I always had the idea that when I was 15 of what love is like and the fact I’ve only ever been with him but he’s been around stresses me out. 

This has caused me to be super insecure and untrustworthy of him and STILL TO THIS DAY bothers me immensely when I thought I would’ve got over it by now. I have had help from a professional to see if I can work through it, but nothing works. Therefore I’m worried I will never get over it and our relationship may become toxic due to me being untrustworthy and excessively jealous.  

Any help or if you have/had a similar situation please let me know!

t2_cxj45q,1553654973.0,b5z2p1,t3_b5z2p1,5,"&amp;#x200B;

I work an office job, and I tend to eat lunch in this quiet sitting area, around the same time most days.  To describe the ""sitting area"" a little bit, there are maybe 10 or so small two seater tables spaced throughout the room, mostly along the walls.  It's not like a noisy cafeteria, or anything like that; it has a little more of a ""coffee shop"" feel to it.  The tables are a little more spaced out though, and aren't so close to make natural conversation with others very easy.

&amp;#x200B;

So, there is this girl that frequently sits in the same area (she works in the same building, but for a different company, and my bet is that she is also single).  Both of us mid to late 20's.  She tends to sit close to where I tend to sit.  I tend to sit at one of the quietest tables, and she tends to sit at a table that you can pretty much think of as the second-quietest table.  If that tells you anything about our personalities...  I am definitely introverted, and pretty shy with girls.  I get the feeling that she is not far from that.  Smart, introverted, always writing (or reading?) something in a notebook.  She tends to be head down, kept to herself.  Probably the same way I tend to be, now that I think about it... She has a bit of a nerdy vibe to her, but I guess I do too and I find that to be attractive.  I tend to be in-and-out of lunch pretty quick, she tends to be there a little longer, but there is a (pretty consistent) 5-7 minute window from when I get there before she leaves, that we are both there.

&amp;#x200B;

At first I tended to see her there on occasion, but I do not remember her noticing me at all.  Then there was a decent amount of time that I did not see her there at all (or very rarely).  Around that time I coincidentally encountered her a few times throughout the building; a few times in passing on the stairwells, and once in the lobby.  The times I passed her on the stairwells we made eye contact.  It was welcoming.  I think she may have recognized me from the ""coffee shop area"".  Definitely seemed like someone I would get along with.  When I ran into her in the lobby she was walking with some coworker guy, getting coffee or something, and was pretty much focusing her attention on him.  He is probably into her, and she did not appear to be against it.  Not saying she was necessarily for it though, either.  Maybe she saw him as just a friend and was being polite; I could not really tell by the way she was acting if she had genuine feelings for him or not.

&amp;#x200B;

After that though (I believe even that same day) I started noticing her in the lunch area again.  She sat at the table I tend to sit at, which I have never seen her do before.  No notebook, and almost had a little bit of a somber vibe.  She looked over at me.  I played along, and sat at her table (which is pretty much the next closest table, probably \~10 feet away).  She left a few minutes later.

She has been around much more consistently since then.  One other day we caught each others gaze when I was walking into the area.  I was maybe 7-10 feet from her and we made strong eye contact.  It actually froze me in place, and was almost like we were staring into each others souls.  I felt a connection, or at the least, that we are compatible.

She is still mostly head down, but I have seen her glancing over at me a few times since then.  I get there, 5-7 minutes later she leaves.  Like clockwork.  But I have also been getting more nervous around her.  I have been breaking the eye contact pretty quickly, usually before she does.  Within the last week or two, she seems to be slightly more kept to herself, but is still showing up pretty consistently.  A little less eye contact.  Perhaps she is giving up because I have not acted on it?

&amp;#x200B;

What I am really wondering is what to do from here.  There seems to be a bit of a connection between us.  I think I may have a little bit of a crush developing.  I get a pretty good gut feeling about her, and it does not seem like she is not interested with me.  If she wasn't, then why the eye contact and why keep showing up (it would be very easy for her to avoid me if she wanted to)?

I have been thinking, the next time she acknowledges me, I will give a simple smile and a wave; if she is receptive, I will go up and introduce myself.  It would be easy to play that off professionally, if she is not interested (ex, just wanted to be friendly and say hi).  Then from there, I would see where things go... if she really is interested in me, maybe she will start conversations or something.  Perhaps I could then look her up on linkedin and take the conversation online / out of the office.  What are your thoughts on this?

Maybe I should just go right up and introduce myself either way, next time she is there?  Or would that be too ""out of the blue""?  What if I flat out ask her if she wants to go on a walk sometime, or something like that?  Too direct / too soon?  How does the fact that we are in an office (working for different companies though) change your view on all of this?

Maybe there is something better to do that I have not thought of... or maybe I am misinterpreting things, and should do nothing?  What would you do in this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post...  I was trying to paint as good a picture of the situation as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr  There is a girl that works in the same office building (but for a different company) that I seem to be compatible with, but we are both introverted and I am not sure what is the best way to break the ice and get to know her better.

t2_udysw,1553661564.0,b60371,t3_b60371,9,"I had posted this story on a different, anonymous account a few months ago. But the story kept going, and although the advice I'd gotten at the time was good advice, I am honestly devastated now.

My wife \[36 female\] and I \[36 male\] had pretty serious problems about three years ago; I'd found out she'd cheated on me. We moved to a big city and started a new life afterward, in large part because I'd wanted to try to make up for being such a shitty husband in the first place that she would want to cheat on me. And indeed I hadn't been a great husband; I was an alcoholic and neglectful, and I was really struggling to move my career forward at all.

Finding out about the cheating made me do a 180, and I feel I've done a pretty admirable job in turning myself around in the time since. I quit drinking entirely (and remain alcohol free), dramatically improved my career, and even to some extent worked on the marriage. That said, I haven't felt my wife has made the same level of change since the affair, and I have expressed to her many times that I expect that at least part of the work of repairing our marriage is in her hands. I do take my responsibility in what happened very seriously, but I am just one of two people in this marriage.

About 5-6 months ago, I had ""friended"" one of my coworkers \[33 female\] on Spotify. Nothing was really unusual about that at first, and because I'm married I wasn't really looking for a relationship of any kind. At the same time, I started to realize how much I admired this coworker. She had really great taste in music, and I'm a really big music fan in general, and whether I was deluding myself or not, I started to get the impression that maybe she was trying to signal to me in her music choices that she had feelings for me, too. We have some things in common, not the least of which is our understanding of our industry, but also other things (we were both English majors, etc.) For a while it seemed like we were engaging in this secret game of swapping music back and forth, and indeed we even talked about music from time to time. Although it was also likely self-delusion in hindsight, I also started to feel like she was flirting a little with me from time to time.

Not long after, she sort of announced to all our coworkers that she had a boyfriend. I did sort of realize at that point that I must have been imagining the whole thing, but I guess my ego wouldn't let me fully accept it. I asked her to coffee once, because she had at one point suggested we grab coffee after work to blow off steam, but she said she was going out with friends that night (although then agreed ""Definitely another time!"") The Spotify thing seemed to continue a bit, although at that point I was starting to doubt what was going on.

Cutting to the chase, that whole thing went on for a good two more months, and I just got increasingly confused and frustrated. Along the way I also seriously starting to question my marriage, and even at one point confessed all of this to my wife, and told her everything. That was about where the last post ended, and the advice from most commenters here then was that I really shouldn't be confusing these two things; if I wanted to end the marriage, then I needed to do it on its own terms, and I agreed.

The additional bit that happened afterward is that I sort of got to the point where I just couldn't take the confusion anymore, and I sent my coworker some texts to see if we could meet to talk. I made it clear that it wasn't really about work, and I think she probably had a sense of what it was about (I'm pretty certain by this point the Spotify thing was obvious and in the open...we seemed to be messaging each other via song choices, but I still to this very moment don't clearly know what exactly was being said). Her texts in response seemed to be really hesitant, and after a day of thinking about it I decided not to put her on the spot because I know that's not fair (and I figured if she felt the same way she wouldn't be so hesitant), and I just sort of told her that I'd thought through what I'd wanted to talk about and that we didn't need to meet to discuss anything anymore.

From that point, things got even weirder; I'm not even really sure what happened, but I think some of my coworkers at some point got in on the game; I sort of drew the conclusion that maybe they were fucking with me, and maybe even she was in on it.

About a week later, she announced that she was taking a position at another company. The company itself has been having some problems, so it was sort of understandable, but I have the distinct feeling that I am probably at least somewhat to blame, and I feel terribly about it. I really wish we could have just talked about it; clearing up the confusion for me, if she didn't feel the same way, would have helped, although I do realize now that I was potentially very self-delusional. But I still feel convinced not all of that was in my head. Some sort of clarity would have made all the difference, and I wouldn't have pushed beyond that.

Since she left, I'm just a total wreck. I felt so intensely about this person, and I had no intention of hurting her or making her uncomfortable so I feel all the worse if I'm to blame, even if in part. For me, I feel like maybe I just watched the love of my life walk away, and maybe she even cared for me, too, but because of the circumstances of being coworkers, and because I am married (not a minor point, I know) we didn't have the opportunity to find out. For myself, I really wish I could just know one way or another, but I feel like now I'll never know, and that it would just be incredibly desperate and wildly inappropriate to try and find out now.

I am really teetering in my marriage at this point; I feel so conflicted about the marriage itself, but at least part of me is  really struggling to give up on it. In the times over the past months when I've talked to my wife about all this -- and indeed I have told her virtually everything about what I'm going through and feeling, trying to be as honest as I can -- she gets really upset and cries, and then I feel badly and sort of talk myself back into staying. But I just feel like it isn't right. Fundamentally, especially after feeling the way I did about this coworker, I don't think it's even fair for me to stay, given that I don't really feel the same way for my wife that I once did, and don't think I ever felt about her the way I did about this coworker. With her, it felt like I'd discovered what love really was, without ever having fully understood it before.

I feel like I'm just never going to recover from this heartbreak. I know some of you might say ""Broken hearts heal"" and all that, but this feels very different to me. I feel like this woman was potentially my life's true love, and I just had to watch this whole stupid scenario play out like a movie in front of me, and that it's just not meant to be, and that I'm going to spend the rest of my life wondering what might have happened with her if things had just been a little different. Not to mention the mess of trying to fully accept what I think I have to do about my marriage...

I honestly don't think we could be happier. And don't get me wrong, this isn't a ""BUT...."" lead up. I'm still very happy! I just need a little advice from someone who's either gone through this before or can offer a helpful outside perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

Well as any longterm couple can attest, the topics of sex and our deep fantasies came up a lot throughout our relationship. After many conversations over the years he revealed how much he loves sex in general. The excitement of new bodies and feeling confidence in the bedroom with a good performance were his biggest turn-ons, and he admitted that he thinks his libido is much higher than the average guy (though he can't be certain because guys don't usually have these kinds of discussions). Years of these types of conversations go by and we both agree that if for some reason one of us felt the urge to cheat, or even got swept up in the moment and cheated, we'd tell the other person immediately and it wouldn't be a bad thing; simply a moment of passion that wouldn't harm our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Months ago he got a new job that takes him out of town frequently, and all of his coworkers go drinking at the end of a long shift. One night he ends up drinking with a woman in her room and they fall asleep naked together (they touched a little but nothing more happened--they were too drunk). He talked to me about it in depth and felt horrible. Even though we agreed it'd be okay, actually taking our conversations and turning them into reality was a big shock for the two of us. Turns out I didn't feel jealous or upset, but instead felt turned on. We had amazing sex afterwards and later discussed the logistics of what we both wanted/expected in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

So months go by and he has a few more opportunities, but only has sex once. I had a couple opportunities myself but only made out with someone, no sex. I sort of felt pressured in the beginning to try and have a sexual experience with someone new so that he wouldn't feel bad, but later worked through those feelings with him. Honestly I've gone through sexual abuse in my childhood and have a hard time with physical intimacy so for me I'm very content being fully monogamous. But through all these experiences, my husband and I essentially became monogamish with healthy guidelines that allowed us to voice our concerns at any point (or call it quits if we don't think it's working).

&amp;#x200B;

I think people are genuinely happier when they're free to be polyamorous, monogamish, monogamous, or other variations instead of being confined to one standard of relationship. And I believe my husband is one of those people. There's a spark in his eyes and I can't deny that we've gotten closer by delving into even deeper conversations about jealousy, vulnerability, sex, and relationships. He's fully committed to me and our future together (we want to start a family) and has repeatedly told me he'd be fully monogamous if that's what I want. Since it's all so new, we're both still deciding if it's the right lifestyle for us.

&amp;#x200B;

But honestly I'd feel selfish if I asked him to stop being monogamish just for me. I know he'd do it in a heartbeat and that makes me feel good about his love for me, but I don't want him to stifle a part of himself just because I have my own insecurities and issues with sex \[and by issues I mean I can't just have a casual hookup due to past trauma\]. Also, I can't help but feel odd about going against society. Not that I care about it in the grand scale \[be who you're meant to be!\] but more in the fact that I can't talk to that many friends about these emotions, let alone anyone in my family. So oftentimes (like right now as I type this) I feel kind of lonely trying to sort through my emotions... There aren't a lot of people to talk to about this sort of thing. I talk to my husband a lot but at the moment I want other opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, sorry for the long post. The reason I'm writing this is because in another Reddit post someone said something along the lines of: ""asking someone who's polyamorous to be monogamous is just as detrimental as asking someone who's monogamous to be polyamorous"" and this stuck with me. I genuinely believe my husband is his best, truest self when he's able to be monogamish and the only reason I'm having issues is because of my own problems surrounding sex. We have a wonderful life, open communication, tons of love, great sex, and both agree he's not out seeking other experiences because he's unhappy. I'm not jealous of the women he's been with or will be with, but I do feel lonely when he's gone and no matter how much he reassures me I feel worried one day he's going to fall in love with someone else. He's even told me he'd quit his job right now if I asked him to and stop traveling. So you see, it's all my issues that I'm trying to work through... Long story short, do you think I should work through my issues and keep working on this monogamish relationship or should I ask him to stop and go back to monogamy? Any advice would be much appreciated.

**TL:DR at the end**

&amp;#x200B;

Background story: I didnt get high enough grades last year, so I had to redo the whole year. This year (the redo year) I did come in class with some other guys I know, as they've failed their class too. One of the girls is a transfer student (from another city, not country) and joined us this year as well. Now she's quite protective of people who're getting bullied and really has an opinion of her own, and honestly, this makes me happy, as there aren't many people who're willing to speak out for me outside of family members or people who I have a tight bond with (like people who I know since practically birth lol) She really came up for me as I wasn't confrontational and really helped me out to seek help.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, me and some close friends did a prank on her and her friends. I was being swapped with another guy on a theatre project (all with both of our consent, but what we all knew was that I can't act very well but am a really good scriptwriter) Tbh even that wasn't fair of me, as she helped me out way too much. Now we executed the prank, but she nearly hyperventilated and had to do a check up with a nurse. Now when she got back, I told her it was all a prank, but I most likely shouldn't have done that as that basically was a 'double whammy'. She really needed to calm down and she was in tears and all, and I really felt devastated. Of course I was happy on one side that someone really did care about me, how weird it all sounds, but on the other hand, I was devastated as I pretty much invoked (?) that reaction out of her, and I feel really bad as someone who cared about me got pranked AND I DIDN'T STOP THEM.

&amp;#x200B;

That was already bad, but we got to our class monitor (by a lack of better word, a teacher assigned to our class) and told her about this. Now as I was part of the prank and felt really guilty I stayed with her and she says she has 'personal issues' at home. I wanted to go out but she says it would be ok if I stayed with her. She has issues with her parents perfectionist issues, and last week we had a mass-murder test. No one got above the 5/10 mark, (in the Netherlands 1 5.5/10 is a satisfactory result to pass classes) even the smart smart guys. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what to do. On one hand she really helped me out seeking help and spoke up for me, but on the other hand, everyone has to deal with their personal issues. I've had my own issues with perfectionist parents, but should I use that as an excuse to 'invade' her life at home?

Thanks in advance.

We've been living together at my parents house up until recently when we moved into our own apartment. We love each other, we laugh at the same things we have similar interests... we've been through a lot together. From not having jobs, to school, traveling, money problems, surgeries, deaths in the family... everything. Currently I'm going to school and working, but it's a lot.

I don't really know how to say it... but early on sex was great. She used to get off many many times in a row during a single session, but eventually that changed. We both really enjoyed it for a year or more. Ater some time I was less interested in it... working long hours, stress, pain, etc... I don't know why but I was somewhat indifferent. That went on for maybe a year but the last 6+ months I've wanted it and she hasn't really been so interested... but it's still been pretty infrequent. She says during this time she might be interested in having sex with other people to try to see what or if we're doing things wrong... both of us are very inexperienced outside of each other and it's felt difficult to explore. She wanted it to be a one time thing, I said I'd feel more comfortable if it were a couple with similar goals and we don't stay in contact with them. Things happened, and we moved, but we haven't really discussed it in some time. 

Now starting last week, she brings up the old doubts again (its happened many times before, but we work it out), and today says she is done via text again and mentions wanting other people etc... I don't know how to work on this with her. I don't want to give up. She's amazing, I love her and we have a life together now... I know she's not fully happy and I want to figure it out together but I just don't know how. I'm willing to do whatever it takes, as long as we're both comfortable with it. I'm not one for relationship advice but I just don't know who to talk to about this... she is busy at a work thing tonight and I'm just torn.

unfortunately, because things just can’t go right for more than a minute at a time, i got the call tonight during my shift at work that i had tested positive for chlamydia. i went into the emergency room last night for what i thought was an aggravated UTI (which came on after the first time i had sex with this man) and came out with fucking chlamydia. this has left me feeling dirty and gross and like no man could ever want to touch me with the knowledge that i have had this disease.

for backstory, i’ve only had sex with three people since the first of the year, and before that, i hadn’t had sex for three months. so, the culprit can only be one of three people, one of whom is him. 

i’ve informed the other two; one of whom reacted badly, and the other of whom was fairly supportive and told me to “be the amazing woman i know you can be, with or without the dude and with or without the clap.” they both deny having given it to me. as i mentioned, i hadn’t had sex for three months before the first of the year, and even then, it was with one of them (the fairly supportive guy).

as i mentioned previously, this new man has been a godsend so far. he is the only bright spot in my 2019, and i would hate to lose him over this. i just came out of a shitty, shitty situationship with a man 15 years my senior who didn’t respect me. i feel like i need and deserve a win, and it’s being unfairly taken from me.

my question is, how do i tell this guy in a way that can potentially salvage what i think could be something really great? he wants to take me all kinds of places and treats me like a queen and i don’t want to lose that just because of a stupid STD, which i have already received the proper treatment for.

When I go to events like a family cookout, birthday party or just to hangout at my boyfriend's house (which he shares with his brother) S and her friends will not say hello to me or talk to me, will whisper behind my back and give those side-eyed looks.

My boyfriend has tried talking to S about it, and so far she has promised to stop talking bad about me in their house (which yes, she has done) but refuses to say hi to me or be polite. It makes my boyfriend and I very uncomfortable and honestly, I can't help but take stuff like this very personally. I try to not let it hurt my feelings, but it does, it's just who I am. She also has started telling my boyfriend made up rumors about me, like I've been talking to an ex (who I have ZERO contact with) and just general shit talking.

She also makes sure to invite my boyfriend, but not me, to anything they do either with J as a family group or with her friends. My boyfriend also shares the same friend group as S and J, so it makes it impossible for me to be comfortable around them at events, since S makes sure every one of her friends (including J) is rude to me.

After asking some mutual friends, I found it all stems from 3 YEARS AGO in college, where S apparently heard me talking about her. It's not true, never did, never would. This is a girl with a SERIOUS grudge complex.

Since my boyfriend has been friends with S, share the same friends with S and since S is his brother's girlfriend, it makes this situation very hard. It's not like we can just drop her for acting like this, and it would ruin his relationship with his brother.

I want to talk to S and try to explain myself, but i'm not sure how to do it. I'm sure this is some type of huge misunderstanding, but i'm not sure S would be happy to even listen to me. She seriously hates me. I have never been treated like this before in my life. I'm even willing to let all the crazy stuff she has done and said to me go, if she could just quit acting like this.

About half a year ago, I started talking to this girl from my seminar group at university. I'm Dutch and she's Italian and our university is in the Netherlands. She's really fun to be around and I enjoy being with her and talking to her. Lately we've been really close and we talk about a lot of personal stuff as well. We've both noticed how much we care about each other and that there are feelings that are starting to grow between us. I've personally never really been in love before, so I told her that I really liked her and that I just wasn't sure if it was love or not, which is not wrong but I know now that I'm definitely in love with her. Now you need to know that this girl is quite crazy, which I love about her, and that she really enjoys sex. She's very physical and told me that most of her previous relationships were mostly about the sex. This is relevant to what she said to me as a response to my shitty confession, as she said that she feels a strong emotional connection and in that way really likes me, but not in a physical way. Later she told me that she never had this before, because she's very physical, and she's never had strong emotional feelings for anyone without the need for anything physical. She has been bullied in the past and is sometimes a bit insecure because of it and she also gets panic attacks from time to time. Whenever this happens I just feel like I want to be there for her and I want to take care of her. I want to tell her this but I don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just very confused about what she said and I don't quite know if it is positive or negative for me. 

We've obviously talked about a lot more stuff which might be relevant, so don't hesitate to ask about anything. I just need some help figuring out what she means and what I can do to maybe take our relationship to the next step.

t2_kex363x,1553664243.0,b60gm5,t3_b60gm5,2,"My mother has been wanting the whole family(her, my 3 younger siblings and I) to take a trip to her home country for the last few months. We just went in January 2017(I paid for 2 tickets to help) and she wanted to go again this upcoming summer. I have expressed my wish to NOT go because I wanted to take a summer class so I can graduate at my CC and transfer on time.  Plus, I did not want her to waste money on paying for my ticket this time around since I stopped working to attend school again. I will add that I am paying entirely for my schooling(I don't expect her to pay) and she believes college is a waste of time when I could be working w/e minimum wage job now =  make instant $ while I believe education leads to better career later = smarter investment imo but that's another dispute for another day. I also have a really bad gut feeling about the flight which has been giving me anxiety and would rather not risk it since it would take close to 24hrs of flying to get there. 


Each time I told them I really don't want to go, my sister and mother would guilt trip me...making me cave in. They would legitimately cry and beg me to go, get mad that ""you don't want to spend time with the family""/ ""you don't care/love us"", throw tantrums where they gave me the cold shoulder and act like I'm a party pooper. Being the pushover, I agreed while still trying to convince them to be okay with me staying back.  I was relieved when the ticket prices got really expensive and my mom decided to only take my two youngest siblings. Then the plan was for me to fly back home to stay with my sister which was what I was going to do anyways since I live in another state. Three weeks passes with me thinking I was off the hook until my sister calls me and said, "" we booked all five tickets! The prices dropped a little. We're going from June to August 21st. Isn't that great?!"" I was so taken aback because 1. They changed their mind suddenly from the original plan and I was not aware of this at all prior 2. My fall semester starts August 19th and I've told them this many times 3. They booked my return flight to their state which means I will have to fly another +8hrs to my state while missing an entire week of the start of classes =&gt; I'll have to talk to my school/future professors to not kick me out of their classes for no shows. I tried to call the booking agency for a return date change for my ticket but the cost was basically half another ticket and I can't afford that atm. There is also a no refunds or cancellation policy.


I just don't know if I have the right to be upset with them especially my mom? I know it was kind of her to buy my ticket and I don't want to sound ungrateful or entitled but this really is not what I wanted to happen. I am 100% happier staying back. I feel like they completely disregarded my feelings and wishes so they could be happy at my expense. On top of that, they did not even take into consideration my education. I understand they might have forgotten the date when my semester starts but it would have taken less than 1 minute to call/text me to ask when I needed to be back in state before they confirmed the purchase. That would have saved me so much trouble and stress. They just did/planned what they wanted for me again...like always. I just don't understand why couldn't they just contact me to let me know beforehand instead of AFTER the tickets were set in stone.

EDIT: My bf, who I live with, suggested for me to put my foot down and not go at all since he didn't want me to be unhappy. Also,  to ""teach"" them that they need to stop pushing me around/ignoring my desires and feelings. He even suggested he'll pay my mother the cost of my ticket since the o.g ticket is nonrefundable. I told him it was very sweet but such a waste of everyone's money at that point. 
 
EDIT: My ticket costs 1.4k.

Tl;dr: Mother and sister booked tickets to another country even after I expressed multiple times it was inconvenient for me to come during their chosen months.  They ended up booking the return flight almost a week after my Fall semester starts at my college because they didn't think/care to ask me.

Recently my mood dropped massively, I felt trapped and miserable, I was having constant panic attacks, I stopped sleeping and eating so I had to do something, I spoke to her about this and she wanted to work on things so we tried but unfortunately I just didn't feel that any more, I couldn't shake that feeling of anxious dread so last night I ended it with her

She was distraut, she relies on me 100% for pretty much everything, I do all the cooking, finances, planning and she only has a low paying job, she switched from screaming at me to pleading with me several times throughout the night. She kept asking can we give this another try and I was honest with her, if I took her back right now it would only be because I felt guilty and that's not fair on either of us

Her mum picked her and last night and she told to spend the night thinking about how we can make this work, then all night she was texting me, nothing in particular but I think it was an effort to make me feel bad or something it was just things like ""good night xxx"" ""hope we can talk tomorrow x"" ""have a good day at work x"" ect

I don't want to give this another chance to be honest, the feeling just isn't there but this is where I'm likely to crack, I'm an emotional wreck right now, I need to sort out ending our lease on the house, rehoming the pets (which is honestly killing me) and sorting all our stuff out. It would be so easy to take her back and forget this whole thing but I don't think I want that, I don't want to do this again a few months or a year down the line

t2_3hirxtm0,1553625071.0,b5tcpc,t3_b5tcpc,13,"I [25F] am having a hard time trusting my bf [27M] of 4 years. He has never given me a reason not to trust him until 4 months ago. I’m sorry for the long post- there’s a lot to say about this. 

My bf doesn’t have an social media accounts and he deleted them when we first met. We moved in together 2.5 years ago and things have been great for the most part up until 4 months ago. For Christmas, my boyfriend and I spent 2 weeks in the Caribbean with his family and friends. A little back story: his family owns time share and has been going to the same place every year for 25 years so they have a ton of people they know there who also go every year. The last time he went was in 2015 about 8 months into us dating. I was obviously upset I didn’t go with him but he deserved some fun. I trusted him completely and didn’t think anything of it really. 

Anyway, fast forward to this past Christmas. It was my first time going and I was so excited. There was this girl he introduced me to a couple of days into our trip, we’ll call her Sarah. The moment I met her, I saw the way she looked at my bf and immediately felt the tension. They were super awkward with each other and she was awkward with me. After we went back to our room, I asked him straight up “what’s going on with you and Sarah? Why is she so awkward?” He denied it and told me I’m crazy for thinking anything of it. I then asked him if he ever slept with her and he said no at first but then admitted that he did one time. He said he didn’t see her the year he went without me because she wasn’t there but her Instagram photos say otherwise.  So I let it go because it wasn’t a big deal- it was before he knew me. I saw her text him a couple of times early in the trip but didn’t think anything of it. We spent the rest of our trip hanging out with her and other friends and she was super nice. 

On our last night there, we all went out drinking. We found out she was visiting the city we live in a month after the trip so I told her to text me and let me know so we can meet up. Before we went our separate ways, we hugged her goodbye and we got back to our room. I went to sleep shortly after as it was late. 

After we returned back to the states, I was using his phone to find an address and I discovered he deleted her texts from earlier in the trip but I found a text to her after I fell asleep on our last night there (approx 4 am) saying “please let me know when you come visit, don’t forget about me :P”. I find that odd because he never deletes texts in his phone and he’s not much of a texter or emoji user. I asked him why he was texting a girl he has a history with when I was sleeping next to him &amp;amp; he got really defensive. He told me to stop snooping. We got into a huge fight because I know my gut is never wrong. But I let it go. 

So last weekend I was reorganizing and came across a bunch of his old college files. We were going through them and I came across an envelope addressed to him that had a return address but no return name. It was heavily sealed with packing tape and he got really defensive about it. So I waited a couple of days until he wasn’t around and I carefully opened it so I can seal it back up. It was a 6 page front and back love letter form Sarah addressed to my bf included with photos of them kissing from 2011. She mentioned a lot of intimate stuff and how they were hooking up for 4 years straight on vacation. She mentioned a lot of stuff that he lied to me about and I’m very uncomfortable about this situation and  now I don’t want her in our lives. She was so in love with him and they clearly had a history but he lied and continues to lie to me about it. 

I am heartbroken about this because He lied to me about it by telling me nothing happened and she didn’t mean anything to him. If it wasn’t a big deal and she didn’t mean anything, why lie about it? I know about all his ex gfs and past sexual encounters EXCEPT this one. My stomach is always in knots whenever I think about her and him. I’m not a jealous type, I just like to be aware of his past relations with girls if I have to hangout with them. It wouldn’t have ever been a big deal considering I have a past as well. We tell each other everything but this is something he won’t be honest about and I have given him plenty of opportunities to come forward. I also recently found out he reactivated his FB and then deactivated it again. I’m not sure why he went back on his FB but now I question everything thing he does and it’s making me really paranoid. 

I haven’t mentioned I opened the envelope because he’ll get mad at me for snooping but I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m really looking for advice or tough love. Was I wrong for snooping? Should I confront him? I want to be with him and I see myself marrying this man but how can I move past this?

It is mostly a good relationship, but she struggles a lot with anxiety, and every time I am unhappy about something in my own life, that my girlfriend does not know how to handle, she has a panic attack. These panic attacks often completely take the focus away from what I was going through. They happen especially often when I discuss things related to a traumatic nonconsensual sexual experience I had right before she and I started dating. Thing is, she isn't a survivor of assault or anything. She just gets freaked out because she ""doesn't know what to say.""

She also often has panic attacks when I tell her she's done something that bothered me or hurt my feelings. These usually end with me comforting her that I am not going to break up with her. We have talked about this before and she says she is working on it in therapy.

Last night was the one year anniversary of the traumatic event. My girlfriend knew this, as it was something I felt anxious about for the month leading up to it. She struggled to talk with me very much about my feelings around it. I was ok with this and sought out other support, and she supported me how she was able--making me food, just hanging out, which was fine by me. In the evening, we watched a movie together, and then made out a little and started heading to bed. When I got into bed from brushing my teeth I found she was already in there and completely naked. Though this is something she occasionally does, that I usually enjoy, it just made me uncomfortable last night, given the traumatic anniversary. I told her I was too tired to have sex and we went to sleep.

Today I decided to bring it up with her. I said, ""I love you, and I usually enjoy you being unexpectedly naked in my bed, but these are a rough couple of days for me, especially around sex. I wish that you had considered that a little more last night. Maybe next time you know that I'm feeling triggered, could you let me take the lead in terms of when I'm comfortable having sex?"" She apologized and agreed that it was inappropriate.

But half an hour later, we were just sitting around doing homework, and she suddenly said she was really upset, that it wasn't my fault, but that she had to go, and booked it out of my house. Before she left I gathered that this was because I had brought up the stuff from last night. She said she felt really guilty and freaked out, and didn't want me to have to take care of her, so she just needed to leave. Now I feel really guilty for bringing any of this up, and feel like I just shouldn't have said anything.

I'm kind of at a loss for what to do.

This has been on my mind a lot and I don't really have anyone to talk to about it. I fear bringing it up with my girlfriend because I don't want to upset her or make her think that I don't like her parents (I do! They are very kind people) - I just wish they'd stop talking to me like I'm an alien.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else deal with a similar circumstance?

t2_3bmdt9k0,1553650990.0,b5yes7,t3_b5yes7,4,"So I’ve become very close friends with this girl over the past year. We hang out or see each other almost everyday because we live next door to each other in our apartment building and are in the same friend group. The 2 of us have developed a strong friendship and have shared a lot of personal things about each other. I recently started to fall in love with this girl and I eventually got up the courage to tel her. I told her I had a crush on her a couple weeks ago and she said “you’re such a sweet guy but, I don’t want to make it awkward and ruin the friendship that we have.” 

So that kinda sucked but I got over it and we’ve been friends since and nothing has been awkward. Anyway, this was about 2-3 weeks ago when I told her that. Then our friend group went out together last weekend (as we’ve done 100 times before) but this time one of this girl’s friends tells me that the girl I have a crush on really wants to make out with me. So in my mind I’m thinking wow this is great she actually really likes me back. So we end up making out the rest of the night and hooking up. It was one of the best nights of my life, and the next day I was the happiest I’ve been in a longtime.

So I’m absolutely on cloud 9 for the whole next day, then the following day she texts me “hey we should talk about the other night”. We talk and she tells me that we should never hookup again because “she doesn’t have feelings for me and her best friend really likes me and she doesn’t want to ruin that friendship”.

The part I dont get is that, we’ve all been out together countless times before and the 2 of us have never made a pass at each other or even considered it. Then all the sudden after I tell her I like her, she wants to makeout with me and hookup. And it has been a few weeks since she basically rejected and I got over that and had 0 intentions of hooking up with her that night. She completely initiated that whole thing and then turns around and breaks my heart 24 hrs later.

I was content with where we were, but to initiate that after knowing I already liked her then turning around and telling me the opposite really screwed with my head.

TLDR: I really start crushing on a close female friend. Told her I liked her and she said we have such a strong friendship she wouldn’t want to ruin that and make things awkward. 2 weeks later she starts making out with me while we’re out and we end up hooking up. She initiated making out at the club which led me to believe she liked me too, because she knew I already liked her and it seems that’s the only reason why she would initiate that. Then 1 day after the hookup she tells me she doesn’t have feelings for me and her best friend has a crush on me, so she wouldn’t want to hurt her best friend.",relationships,"Myself (22M) and close friend (21F) giving very confusing, mixed signals"
t2_3fmkii07,1553625643.0,b5tgwj,t3_b5tgwj,33,"Sorry this is a bit long. I am 37, wife is 35. We got married young (24/22) and had kids fairly shortly after. We've had a fairly tumultuous relationship, but I have grown tremendously over the years. I've realized some of the very poor decisions I made and want to be better for myself and our relationship, but she is very unwilling to take steps toward positive change.

&amp;#x200B;

As briefly as I can tell it, I was always a very passive person. My parents were very domineering/controlling, and I unfortunately allowed myself to be drawn to the same thing in a spouse. After dating for just over a year she gave me an ""ultimatum"" that we had to get engaged or she'd leave me, which I caved to. After we got married, she revealed some past trauma that has had tremendous negative impact on our sex life. (yes....we were ""good Christian kids"" that didn't have sex before marriage)...I encouraged her to go to therapy, which she did briefly, but never talked to her therapist about it, and nothing has changed. Later we started going to therapy together, and after spending almost a year with her not being honest and me being too passive to call her out, the therapist finally started to see through the BS, and my wife stared refusing to go back. Our relationships is full of double standards, she's incredibly harsh with me, will magnify any mistake I make while getting angry at me if I even suggest she may have done something less than perfect, and will refuse to have any difficult conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Through a lot of this, I began learning much more about myself, seeing my faults and flaws, and trying to become a more confident, healthy person. We've had a number of life challenges that have been legitimate obstacles. My wife and kids have chronic health problems and the kids have cognitive/behavioral issues that make them relatively high needs.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, while my wife experienced some very good career success, mine began to stagnate. With the kids' needs and the cost of childcare, we decided it made more sense for me to quit my job and try to find ways to work from home. While this alleviated some of the immediate stress, it is now causing more problems. She says she always wanted to be a stay at home mom, and is now very resentful that I'm home with the kids. The thing is, we live in a very high cost of living area, and there's no way I could get a job that even approached her salary. Going back to school is an option, but pushes the horizon out significantly, and even then would be well below her income. If she can't quit her job, she will still be unhappy.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently do nearly all the household chores, shopping, all the childcare before/after school including therapy appointments, at home therapy, homework help, staying up/waking up when they have sleep problems, cooking literally every meal and washing all the dishes even on weekends/when she's home, plus just about everything else. On top of all this, she wants it all done while she's gone so it doesn't impact her time at home, with dinner hot and ready on the table when she arrives. Plus, I'm trying to get a home-based business rolling which she constantly shits on for not being more successful. Not really easy when I only get a few hours a day to work after all the household tasks are addressed. I know her salary is obviously more important in a practical sense, but I have no doubt I put in far more ""labor"" hours than she does when you look at the full picture.

&amp;#x200B;

I've told her I'm willing to put all options on the table. In particular, moving to a more affordable area, go back to school, make major lifestyle changes, etc. She's unable to even talk about it without descending into tears or yelling at me. She's straight up told me that I've ""ruined her life."" She sees the kids getting older and feels like time is slipping away from her (even though she pushed to rush us through life stages), and any of our potential solutions wouldn't be fast enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I think she is a person who struggles to be happy in any circumstance. Every stage of our lives, she's always had a different goal that she ""needed"" in order to be happy, and once we got there, the goalposts moved. I honestly don't think she'd be happy even if she got everything she thinks she wants...just find something new to be upset about.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the question is, what next? I know I need to start drawing healthy boundaries. I can't continue to navigate around all the issues and walk on eggshells to just try to keep her happy while she regularly reminds me that she's miserable and I'm a worthless piece of crap. I think we need to go to therapy and I can't allow her to dodge the real issues.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern, substantiated by past events and conversations, is that she won't be able to handle this. That it will lead us on a path to separation/divorce. While I'm willing to accept that risk for myself personally, it would have a tremendously negative impact on our kids who are at a very vulnerable stage at the moment. For all her (and my) flaws, we've always been able to keep things very insulated from the kids. I know it's never perfect, that they pick up on more than we realize, etc....but in general we have very positive family times, never argue in front of them, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there ever a justification to just stick it out until they're older? Anyone have experience with either side of that coin? I know if I take healthy steps and she can't handle it, it isn't my fault....but unfortunately the kids will be the ones to take the brunt of the emotional consequences, which I'd prefer to avoid.

Sorry for the length, thanks for reading and any insight.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Allowed myself to be a doormat early in the relationship. We have some challenges, wife is resentful because I ""get"" to stay home with kids, but she's resistant to actually working on the root problems. Fear that if I draw healthy boundaries, it's  likely to cause separation. Kids are at vulnerable stages, does it ever make sense to stick through that and wait until they're older?",relationships,"Significant relationship issues, my [M37] wife [F35] is unwilling to work on them.

Hi, there's this issue that came up recently with me and my boyfriend [19m]. Basically, we dated for nine months and then broke up. It's been like five months now and both of us have worked on ourselves and are getting back together. Okay, that's fine. But there's this one thing. Both of us had been seeing other people while we were apart. I had a fwb relationship with a guy I caught feelings for, but was unreciprocated. What he was doing with other people wasn't major , just a bit of flirting. Anyway, we were talking late one night catching up and the topic of the people we had been with while we were apart came up. I've tried to be as transparent as possible with him about my crush on the fwb, and actively working to get over that crush. He was a hell of a dick to me so honestly much better being forgotten. But there's this one thing that my bf brought up that's really nagging at my insecurities during the conversation. It was the topic specifically of ""were you ever with someone you thought you could be with forever"". We had a super tumultuous relationship because of our mental health issues so neither of us were gonna jump out and say eachother....

But he did say his ex girlfriend S. He and S broke up about two months before we originally started dating, and only dated for four months. They were best friends before and continued to be but broke up because she would always ignore him and some other related shit. He was being honest with me and I was like, hey, he's over her now so I didn't let it get to me. But then, he mentioned how he never stopped having feelings for her and he started talking about her like she was some long lost love, the one who got away type shit. In my face . Right after we had make up sex. He had feelings for her our entire relationship and still does despite them not being in active contact for months :( and he reassured me that whole time that he didn't feel that way about any of his exes, just that ""he platonically cared about them."" 


I tried to keep what he said again at the back of my mind because at this point we were still in the beginning stages of getting back together and I didn't want to go crazy over it. But then, like two weeks later (two days ago) we hung out for like six hours and then went to grab some food. We were talking and idk how it came up again but it was like ""who are the most beautiful people you've ever seen"" I rated him so of course I asked him to do the same for me, and he was like 9/10. I laughed and asked him who was the 10/10s. One of those people was S :( and he described her as ""mind glowingly beautiful"". At this point all the shit he said really got to me but I was still in a space where I was trying to be funny so I made a joke like ""wow, looks like you would drop me instantly for her"". He just kind of laughed and didn't say anything so I kept asking. After like three times he just looked at me and said ""what, do you want me to lie?"" At this point I wasn't smiling or laughing anymore so I got up, feeling like I was about to cry and just started walking away with my leftovers. 

He got up after me trying to get me to come back and I just kind of rushed out (dw we already paid). When we both got into the car he told me he was joking about the ditching me thing. I was pretty upset so I just kept asking him questions for more details, he kept telling me ""oh it's just a crush, that's not a big deal"". Thing is, a crush is supposed to be a small thing that disappears after a while of no contact ... but he's been crushing on her for literally a year and a half, but hasn't actively spoken to her since last start of school except for a little, he thinks she's prettier than me, and acts like she's this fucking long lost lover who he wishes he was still with. I'm kind of just looking for advice on what to do and how to react. All I know is this hurts a lot and is keeping me up at night ..... I have BPD which is currently barely under check and I don't want to put myself in a situation again where I'll end up in a lot of pain :(

He is planning on doing peace corps (2.5 years) in september and I felt I could just ride it out till then and break up, but I'm stressing because I have to make a summer plan now, and saying I don't want to spend it with him feels like ending things forever, and this is where I'm worried about his life and mindset.

He is quite depressive and anxious, many of his friends have changed locations, and he invests way too much emotion in me and how much attention I give him, which doesn't feel fair as I am so young and enjoying college.

This guy is by far one of the hottest teachers if not men I’ve ever seen. He has an amazing toned body and is super smart at the same time. Not only that, he seems very nice and genuine, he’s super patient and really makes an effort to connect with the students and make sure they understand the subject. I just can’t get this guy out of my head.

As the title explains I am of legal age and he only teaches a few hours a week on the side, he has another day-job where he works in the field he teaches. I no longer follow his classes so it could not be mistaken for abuse of power, in my country this case would be legal. I know this all sounds a bit heavy and like I’m thinking way to far but I just wanted to make this info available for those who are concerned :)

Here comes the more light part, I myself am very socially awkward and have a hard time connecting with people. Besides that, I don’t really have an excuse to contact him anymore. What are some ways I could show interest or flirt(?) a little. 

I’ve caught him looking at me a couple of times when I was working and at my body when I started showing up looking nicer (for him) and he’s already asked if I have a boyfriend but I can understand if he won’t make the first move. It would have been the perfect opportunity to ask if he’s single as well but I chickened out. 

He also started a random/forced conversation with a student sitting next to me about how racist people (against black people specifically) of his country of origin are idiots and he doesn’t agree with their way of thinking (I’m a POC, he’s white). It was a little awkward but his intentions were good, it seemed like he wanted me to hear because it was super out of the blue and the person didn’t ask him nor did the conversation steer in that direction. Of course it could also be a case of me just seeing what I want to see.

I’m horrible noticing social cues like romantic intentions. Help?

TLDR: I have a crush on my teacher, it would be legal to have a sexual relationship, I’m socially awkward tho and have no excuse to contact him. Should I pursue or drop it? If not, how?",relationships,I [22F] have a crush on one of my teachers [late 20sM] any tips on how to pursue him or if I even should?
t2_2eubbrx6,1553626117.0,b5tkh1,t3_b5tkh1,15,"I’m 22, female, I have a great boyfriend who is 23 and we’ve been together for two years. We met when he lived a mile down the road from me, but then he moved to another city three hours away and he stayed there for a little over a year. I don’t have a car so I would take a five hour bus trip to see him from time to time while I was busy with a demanding degree program (time away from my school always makes me incredibly nervous - like I’m missing something or being irresponsible.) His house wasn’t very comfortable, in fact when he lived down the road from me he had no furniture and not even a bed, just a stack of folded blankets on the floor to sleep on, so I only “slept” (couldn’t sleep at all) there once and he spent most of his nights at my place. 

When he lived in a different city he at least had a futon mattress on the floor but still a pretty dingy and uncomfortable place with a crappy bathroom and it was freezing, plus he had white dreadlocked roommates who would hold drum circles in their room; sometimes we crashed at his parents house because there was at least a bed there? My guy has money, and comes from money, and really doesn’t have much excuse for not having a bed except he’s a minimalist lol. He’ll buy a $400 shirt but not a bed. 

He has a truck so it was a lot easier and quicker for him to drive to visit me, so he did that more often than I visited him. Now he lives in my city again, although a 45 min bus ride away from me, (he will meet me halfway and pick me up from an earlier bus stop) again he lives in a dingy and cold and uncomfortable place with a roommate he has lots of disagreements with. He sleeps on a wool pad with linen sheets, my skin is sensitive and it is unbearably itchy and usually cold. I bought a mattress pad for him and brought over some of my blankets and pillows but it didn’t do much to make the situation better. 

I take comfort really seriously and he’s even said himself my place is more comfy than his. Plus I live right next to my college and I need to go on campus pretty much every day, often all day. School takes up all of my life. It’s a craft school and it’s immensely laborious and conceptual and in order for me to get my tuition’s worth I pretty much have to *always* be thinking about school; projects, homework, critiques, presentations, and right now I’m in my thesis year which is the most intense year of the program and I feel especially glued to my campus the last eight months. 

I feel like I am a homebody and love my little comfort zone of an apartment, and experience great anxiety from being away from my school even for a day, god forbid overnight. I have a cat I need to make arrangements for at my apartment if I go to his place. I have to make accommodations with my school schedule and my ability to do work if I go to his place. For all of these reasons and more, I hate going to his house. I just...would rather not go there, and I think it’s unfair to him. I’ve always hated sleeping at unfamiliar &amp; uncomfortable houses, it’s not just him. 

But I think it’s a bit of a problem, because he complains that he always drives here which takes gas and car maintenance money and I really never go over to his place. I have explained it’s not comfortable and I have things i need to take care of at my apartment/school. he says mainly it’s the “principle” that upsets him. Sometimes he’s understanding about it and sometimes he’s not. I love him and I want to show him that I appreciate his efforts, but I just realllly really really really don’t want to go over to his place. We’ve talked about how soon after I graduate, I’ll have to move and get a mellow post-graduation job that I will hopefully never have to think about outside of paid working hours, that I’ll probably have a lot more time and space and freedom and mental energy to go to his place instead of him coming to mine. But he doesn’t believe that, and it makes me feel like I shouldn’t believe it either. I don’t know what my deal is. I love this boy a lot but I hate going over to his house and I feel guilty about it. 

Do I sound agoraphobic to you? Is this unreasonable? How do I talk to him about this moving forward? Should I talk to my therapist about this instead of casting it out into the internet lol?


TL;DR: I love my boyfriend but he has lived in dingy and uncomfortable places. I am very dedicated to a high pressure degree program and I live next to my campus.

Seems like a nice situation except that im also super shy, but with a side dish of crippling social anxiety. I mean the guy isn't blind, he defineatedly has noticed how shy and awkward I am around people, but the problem is that he probably has no idea how bad anxiety I have and how It's destroying my life. By bad I mean because of it I haven't been able to get a job, I'm failing most of my college courses, I can't make phonecalls, have never been in a relationship and so on.

I've been talking to a guy for a while now. He's funny, sweet, has his life together, and I think we could be a really great team.

We were talking on the phone about signals. He said that if a girl invites someone into their room, it unequivocally signals that she wants to have sex. I said, ""But what if I just want to make out in a more comfortable position? Or make out in a room where my roommates can't walk in on us?"" and he said, ""If we are already making out on the couch, then if you move into the bedroom there should be some sort of progression. If you are only going to make out then just stay on the couch.""

He then told me a story: ""I met a girl on Tinder and she was just in town for the night. We met for a drink and she invited me to her hotel room. We started making out on the bed and her hand started rubbing me. When I went to take my pants off she stopped my hand. I got upset and left right away."" I said, ""You know that people aren't entitled to have sex, and she can stop you at anytime. Why were you so upset?"" He said ""I know that I'm not entitled to it. But I also know that I'm too old to waste my time on girls who just like to tease. It pisses me off when girls build it up and then stop. I would never force anything on anyone, so I just left.""

On one hand, I understand his frustration and I appreciate that he didn't even attempt to coerce or force anything out of her. But at the same time, this attitude of ""we're in a room so that means we are having sex, and if we aren't then I'm going to get pissed and leave"" scared me. What if we are making out and I don't feel emotionally safe enough to stop if I don't want to do more?

We have been together for 3 months and everything works well so far. We live far from each other (1 hour drive), usually we meet every 2 weeks, but recently we have not met for a month.

Last week, I told him that I want to visit my friend that living in another city which is 1.5-hour drive away and would love him to go with me (he has a car, I do not, this is the first time I asked him to drive me and I also considered this as a dating trip as we have not met for a month). He agreed and we planned to visit her on this Sunday. 

Today, he texted me saying that his friends will have a BBQ party (he meets his friends every week) and asked me to join him and consider to reschedule the visit to next Sunday if possible. After discussing, we agreed that we will both join the BBQ party on Saturday and then visit my friend together on Sunday. But then, I asked him one more time to confirm, what was his opinion and preference, that if he prefers to not go with me to meet my friend or have something else to do, then I can go alone (I wanted to know if he really wanted to go with me or not)

After thinking for a while, he let me go alone--which I will have to take buses (3 hours each way). He said it would be better for me to meet and spend time with my friend rather than having him there (he does not know my friend).

I am so sad since he does not sincerely want to go with me, to make me happy and show that he cares about me. We have not met for a month and I thought this is also a good chance for us to spend time together. Does he really care about me? Or am I just overreacting? I feel like, I need a boyfriend that would like to accompany me or willing to make me happy. I know driving for 1.5 hours each way is really tiring, but this is my first time asking him to do that, and this can also be considered as a dating trip too. 

What should I do? We are still early in the relationship. I am considering to break up with him but not sure if that is what I should do.

TL;DR! My boyfriend cancelled the plan to drive me to meet my friend (1.5 hour drive) which we planned last week, instead, he will join a BBQ party with his friend (who he meets every week) and let me take buses (3 hours each way).

t2_3hdl38s7,1553567945.0,b5k8hr,t3_b5k8hr,63,"I have a feeling this is ""my"" issue and I need to just get over it, but I wanted to check here for some outside opinions.

A year and a half ago, I got involved with a friend who was also a coworker. We kept our relationship secret due to not wanting rumors in our workplace (though it was technically totally fine for us to date -- we're both just private people and didn't want a bunch of attention on us). During this time, he was long-term friends with a woman (32F) who had pursued him romantically pretty heavily early on in their own friendship. At one point, long before he and I met, they had been planning to date each other, but those plans fell through and she ended up relocating. From what he told me, she had been much more into him than vice versa, and even though they were really good friends now, she also annoyed him a lot.

Well, while he and I were dating, I found out she was sending him topless selfies (she had gotten breast implants and wanted to show him) along with a lot of sexual comments. She didn't know he and I were dating (literally no one did other than our families -- we were getting ready to ""come out"" after I got a different job), so I can't say she was crossing boundaries, but the guy I was dating was doing nothing to shut it down until I brought up that it felt inappropriate. He told me he would drop their friendship in a heartbeat if it meant keeping me, but I ended up breaking up with him for a combination of reasons, one being that I felt like she and him were actually much more compatible than he and I were and that they'd eventually end up together.

Well, me saying that kicked off MONTHS of him denying it and trying to win me back. He told me a \*lot\* of personal details about her and why he never in a million years would want to date her, all the ways he felt I ""mopped the floor"" with her, how I was the love of his life, that he would wait for me for years if he needed to, on and on. He said a lot of comments about her character, her appearance, her lifestyle, her intelligence, and a bunch of other things that would have been devastating to her if she ever found out. This literally went on for months. I have so many emails from him that are basically just bashing her and explaining why he felt like she could never compare to me.

Flash forward a year, I moved to a different state, she moved back to town, they started dating, and now they're engaged. I've distanced myself a bit from both of them (she tried to become friends with me after they got together). She has no idea he and I dated (just that we've been friends awhile), that he called me the love of his life, or that he insulted the hell out of her for months.

So now my predicament. I received a wedding invitation and I feel really, really uncomfortable about going. From the outside, they seem really happy together (at least gauging from social media, which he isn't on, but she posts on constantly). I sensed from the beginning that they're perfect for each other, and that he went over the top with insulting and badmouthing her in part because he still had feelings for her and was trying to cover them up. But, I feel so weird about sitting at a wedding knowing that he and I have a secret history she doesn't know about, and that he said so many terrible things about her and she has no idea. 

Basically, I'm wondering if I'm just stuck in the past too much and need to move on from what happened and support their love that has blossomed. Would I be a crappy friend to not attend their wedding due to my own discomfort?

My friend (28M) said a lot of mean, insulting things about his now-fiancee (32F) after I broke up with him.

I strongly believe that we need to improve on sexual education and acceptance as a whole. 

To further delve into this, first I'm going to explain my current situation. I'm 18, a senior in high school, and have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for nearly 2 and a half years. We started dating when he had just turned 16, and I was still 15. For the first few months of our relationship, my parents didn't consider it one at all. They kind of ignored its existence and due to this, I could only see my boyfriend at school. My parents said I was ""too young"" for a boyfriend, and whenever I asked why, it usually had to do with me getting pregnant. 

This is a common thing among parents, from what I can tell. Most parents don't want their kids engaging in sex, whether it be for religious reasons, pregnancy, the risk of STDs, the list goes on. 

These are normal concerns to have. But instead of educating the kids on how to prevent pregnancy and STDs, and picking the right partner, they don't let them have sex at all. Even at my school, when they should've been teaching us how to do it safely, they taught us to not do it at all. 

And that's just unrealistic. 

It's going to happen. People are going to find a way around it. This causes teenagers to sneak around, do it in unsafe conditions, and fear the shame from their parents if they ever were to find out. 

In my case, my mom used scare tactics to keep me from it. Once she accepted my relationship, she threatened me constantly about sex, saying if I did, I'd be thrown out on the street. Whenever my boyfriend came over, we had to leave the door wide open, and often times she would send one of my siblings in the room to occasionally ""check up on us"" and see what we were doing. 

This made both me and my boyfriend paranoid and the lack of trust was very present. 

A few months into our relationship, my boyfriend and I tried to have sex at his house. Long story short, we couldn't. We both were so nervous, for reasons we didn't understand at the time. I then started to cry, and we had to stop. 

Thinking back on it, I know why this happened now. My parents made us feel like what we were doing was wrong. Even though it was consensual, even though we were being safe, even though we wanted it. It still felt wrong. 

Fast forward two years later, and we tried again. Keep in mind that throughout this time, we engaged in other sexual acts, just not intercourse. Last night, we felt ready, and we tried. Nearly the same thing happened. We both got so nervous and agreed to stop and talk about it. 

I think it's important to note that we're both virgins, so that factor doesn't help. Sex for the first time is nerve wracking on its own, but doubling that with the constant fear of punishment for doing something natural and normal was overwhelming for us. 

My mom is slowly starting to loosen up on being strict about sex, and even put me on birth control, mainly for my bad periods, but still. She occasionally will bring it up and praise me for being patient and waiting, and that I'm ""earning"" my right to have sex with my boyfriend. 

I don't think it's any of her business. 

Little does she know that her way of parenting has messed with my head, made me feel ashamed of my sexuality, and scared me out of engaging in intercourse in fear of what could happen if I did. 

I want to hear opinions on this topic. Advice would also be appreciated. 

Because I was never taught how to be safe, or how to feel comfortable with my body and someone else's. I'm still dealing with the aftermath of this to this day. 

My boyfriend and I are completely comfortable with each other. There is so much love between us and there's definitely desire. I'm not sure what to do to get these damaging thoughts from my mom out of our heads. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My parents threatened me and my boyfriend of 2 years to not have sex, and now that we are ""allowed to"", we get too paranoid and guilty to. It's messed with our heads, and we need advice on how to not be ashamed or scared.

t2_i33tv,1553670251.0,b619mf,t3_b619mf,5,"She and I have been basically best friends for the past two years in Uni. Early February she wanted to talk about a relationship because it was obvious that I liked her to some capacity. A little fiasco of her being infatuated and leading me on happened and she ultimately concluded that she and I were not mentally ready to be in a relationship (we both suffer from anxiety). She's been adamant since then about not having any feelings for me beyond being friends. What really confuses me is she said that if she did have complete control over her feelings, then she would choose me to be in a relationship with and roughly in her words that I am the type of person she wants to be with. She also said to ""not wait for her to be ready for a relationship/become interested."" Right now we're still best friends, snapchatting/texting each other every single day. It was today in particular that she asked again if I still have feelings for her to which I replied that I do still have them. Her response was ""It's okay. It takes a while.""
This has really been bothering me because for a short while after our talk weeks ago I thought she wasn't taking this event and how I felt seriously. She has since apologized for leading me on and we have been behaving mostly normally for the past two weeks.  

They way I see it, she's talking as if she's waiting for me to stop having feelings for her so that I can eventually leave this all behind and not worry about it anymore. While I do want to completely respect her feelings on the matter, I'm not sure if I can/want to just drop everything. Dealing with social anxiety makes it very hard to talk to people outside of our friend group, let alone with the goal of being in a relationship. Hell, throughout this whole experience I've never been completely sure of my own feelings towards her. But, the idea of not being able to be with the person I am closest with deals quite a blow to my self-esteem and general attitude to how I should act around her.  

My mind is completely all over the place. She makes it sound relatively easy to stop after waiting for a while and has reassured that we can still be friends. Thought I am deeply afraid of whether these feelings will go away or won't and will eventually snap.

tl;dr: Best friend at uni can't see me as more than a friend but would date me if she did. Wants me to eventually lose my feelings for her but I don't know if I can.

Every time we where together I felt like everthing around us stopped and we had a lot of chemistry. We were basically close friends. I noticed that something was wrong, i wasnt feeling ok because we were nothing serious. He was dating others and that hurt. I should have not felt like that but i caught feelings since day one. 

A week ago I finally decided to talk to him because we have been dating  and talking for about 5 months. Turns out he doesn’t want anything serious with anyone because he wants to focus on his 4 jobs and on his masters degree. Also he wants to date/fuck other people because he ended a 3 years relationship about 6 months ago. He told me he cant give me what i want.  I know that he likes me but i guess not the necessary . 

Our communication went from everyday to almost non existent. I want to contact him even though i was the one who kind of ended things. I can try and still be fwb or just fb. My situation is so bad that i even decided to have casual sex with other people and im not like that at all. I just want to try it and see if i can forget him. I will be entering graduate school in a couple of months and i don’t think it is the best idea to have something serious for a couple of years but the feeling of losing him is turning me nuts. 

Should i completely move on and try to forget him?Should i contact him after a couple of weeks? Should I try casual hook ups and then contact him afterwards? Should i wait for him to contact me and if he doesn’t then lose all my hopes? Should i delete him from social media and have 0 contact with him? I know it doesn’t make sense what im feeling.

t2_3hi8yy2r,1553624753.0,b5ta7e,t3_b5ta7e,63,"Burner account obviously because I’m afraid I (35 f) sound insane. Preface this by saying I do have major trust issues with this person, as they cheated on me before (emotional cheating) and I am in the process of forgiveness and rebuilding trust. This is the major reason I’m posting this here, I don’t feel like I can trust my judgement right now.

My boyfriend of 1.5 years (30 m) came home from class when the semester started and informed me that he knew someone in class. The person is a girl, lets call her Beth (26 f). Beth is his friend from highschool’s ex-girlfriend. Immediately my spidey senses went off. He isn’t still good friends with this guy – I have never even seen them interact on social media. And Beth is this guy’s ex-girlfriend. **I have nothing against existing friendships that predate our relationship.** However, Beth doesn’t seem like an old friendship to me, Beth seems like a reconnection.

Now here is what bothers me:

1. a couple weeks into the semester we are shopping for socks, it was part of a present I was giving him. He announces that he wants to buy some Phish socks, and that he “needs to start listening to Phish more”. I go “do you?” kind of as a joke but this was weird. This is a guy who loves punk and classic rock. Not Jam Band Grateful Dead stuff. Come to find out from her social media, Beth likes Phish.

2)BF always is in a good mood when he comes home from this class, and always wants to have sex. This is unusual as his sex drive has been an issue lately.

3)I was driving home from a conference in inclement weather conditions. BF calls me, I assume to see how I was / what time I would be home. I am on speaker and telling him about the storm I’m in and how scared I am. I hear him TEXTING. Find out – he was texting Beth about an exam that was due that night. He only called me to find out the location of his charger. This was around 5 pm. I get home, only then for his phone to be pinging all night until nearly 12:30 am with them texting CONSTANTLY about answers to this exam. He then exclaims (Beth) “isn’t even going to be able to start the test until after 10 when she gets home from work!” At one point I commented hey – it’s a little late to be texting – to which he replies “Shes not cute” – which is true, I’ve checked her social media, but still. And of course she sits right behind him in class all the time.

4) And this is the kicker – he blushed when I said her name. After he initially brought her up he would only refer to her as “that girl from my class” and finally I said, “Beth?” and this mf blushed.

5) They started following each other on social media. Shortly after this I tell my boyfriend, look, I’m not comfortable with your relationship with Beth. I think you have a crush on her – he goes from calm to over the top. Saying shes like a sister. Saying I’m reading “way too much into this” when I said he blushed. To his credit he did post picture of us to his social media after this, and Beth has not liked it. He hasn’t liked any of her posts either. This is how I know I’m going insane. If they are just good friends, “like a sister”, why would he avoid liking any of her pictures and why would she not like his? Especially if it’s a photo of her supposed “good friend from HS” and his new girlfriend? That seems like a post you would like. IDK. I’m going crazy over here. He SUCKS at boundaries and never wants to seem “rude” to girls who come on to him. Should I trust him? I’m not a snooper so can’t confirm if their texts/convo’s are just school related. I’m just sick of not knowing and not being able to trust.

t2_5ris4,1553595060.0,b5nvi6,t3_b5nvi6,66,"My brother has always been a bit of an ""extreme"" kid, in the sense that he is either very angry or very happy. He is a big, tall young man and he's strong and intimidating without trying.

He often hurts me. He always has often hurt me since he was a toddler so I've always just shrug it off as him being a clumsy toddler, a kid adjusting to his own body, a hormonal teenager, etc. He is very verbally mean too, will demean our mother (she lets him) and try it with me (I tell him off so that usually triggers more meanness and being physically upset).

He is almost 18 now, and I feel that should be old enough to understand boundaries. He often has explosive reaxtions where he gets angry for misunderstanding a joke or not winning in a board game. Last month, he got angry, jumped up, shoved a chair aside on his way to his room, right next to our grandmother, startling her and upsetting her. We talked about him amongst ""the adults"" but they never really approached him. As always, we let it go.

This weekend I went home for dad's birthday. My uncle and grandparents were there too. My brother didn't say much at all, he just watched tv so there is absolutely nothing this time that I could justify him getting upset over. When we were leaving, i went over to hug / kiss him goodbye. He had the tv remote in his hand and when I reached to kiss his cheek, he smacked the top of my head. Admittedly, not that hard - he certainly has hurt me much harder in the past - but he isn't *allowed* to hurt me for no reason. I got startled and I had a head ache so it *did* hurt, so I spoke up and said ""what the hell was that for?!"" and push him away. He was smiling during it u til I pushed him away, and then he said ""dudr it wasn't even that hard, I'll hit you full force so you know how that feels"". I couldn't react much further because mum stepped in to *defend* him by saying ""it wasn't that hard, don't overreact"". Mum has been enabling this since the start, making excuses and telling others they overreact.

Today, mum texts ne asking ""are you mad?"", which is Mum for ""I feel upset abiut something and you haven't texted me since Saturday, drag it out of me"". I knew what it was about and asked her if she felt sad about yet another strained interaction between my brother and me. She admitted it, and immediately made excuses again: it wasn't that hard, he doesn't know his own strength, he doesn't mean it like that, he hurts me too, I just bruise easily though, etc.

And then it hit me (pun intended): that is exactly the kind of thing abuse victims will say in defence of their abuser.

Mum has been in abusive relationships before, so she should recognise those signs in him imo.

So now I'm worried if it's ""kids will be kids"" and I'm overreacting, or if I'm right to worry and should talk to his dad about this all. My mum is not receptive. When I tell her I don't want to be treated like that, she apologises for him but seems to think it's ""sibl8ng trouble"" and not a real issue - or she sweeps it under the rug because seeming like a healthy, functional family is very important to her.

**TL;DR** I think my brother has verbally / physically abusive tendencies towards my mum and me. Am I right to worry?

------------------------------------------------

**Edit 1:** I apologise for all my typos, I wrote this on mobile and woah, I suck at typing with sausage fingers. 

Meanwhile, I've been talking to my mum on Facebook (yes, I also prefer face-to-face conversation but that's not something that works with my family, so this is fine). I explained to her that while I love him and her and my family very much, this has to change because I don't feel safe. I told her that he obviously CAN control his own strength and reactions because he doesn't do it to others, only to her and me, and she basically defends him for it, saying it upsets her that I dare think that of him, that he doesn't mean it that way. She assures me my brother loves me and he thinks about me a lot when e.g. he sees something I like and goes ""oh mum buy that for sis"". I don't doubt he loves me, but he sure has a very special way of showing that. Love is respect, though, and if he can't respect me, then he simply can't love me. 

She then said **""is there something I need to know about you, that you're putting this on your brother""**, and that, to me, sounds like she's implying I'm in an abusive relationship myself, which honestly has me livid. My fiancé is the best person I know and the only thing keeping me sane throughout this, preventing me from making rash decisions I might regret later on. He is also convinced she didn't mean to imply that and there's another explanation, so I've given her the opportunity to find her words and use them to express herself, which she genuinely has never been good at. 

She also brought up that ""I think it's normal that I don't like her side of the family and that hurts her"", which I guess is something that has been bothering her ever since I announced my engagement and she asked if I would be inviting her side of the family to our wedding, and I told her that I've hardly seen them in the past five years, they haven't even made an effort to meet my boyfriend / fiancé and I don't like them because I think they are bad people with bad moral values and I don't want to associate with them or invite their drama into my life - which I feel is a right I have to enforce for myself, but which I also understand upset her very much because she loves her family.

I'm wondering if I should even attend my own birthday party (my stepdad's family throws a ""group party"" for the entire family every couple of months to celebrate the birthdays in the time since the last gathering) this Sunday. I feel like we're going to explode at each other, either my brother and I, or my mother and I, and I don't want to be poking any dragons. I've also come to the conclusion that last Saturday's events had me feeling like I myself could snap at any time and punch him in the face, which I obviously don't want to be doing and setting that precedent with him.

------------------------------------------------

**Edit 2:** It turned into a full-blown fight where she accused me of only escalating this because I want to go no contact with her, which ironically, it feels like it's leading up to. Which I hate, because I really do love my family and would like to remain close to them. She refuses to see that I'm bringing this issue to her because she has to do something about it, she says I'm overreacting for ""what is only a tap with a remote control"" and ""he probably meant it to show he loves you"", like what the fuck, how is that a normal cognitive connection to say ""bye I love you"" by hitting them on the head with whatever object you're holding? 

She then wanted me to ""drop it"" and ""forget about it"", then went on to say ""I'll see you Sunday, at noon, we'll pick you up"" - like, nope, not going to happen. You're not seeing me on Sunday unless there is effort from your side. 

I also suggested therapy for her and my brother, but as I predicted, ""therapy is for crazy people, why not just put me in an asylum"".

She also added that this is how she is, a bad mother and bad at communication, and that she won't change no matter what. Basically, ""if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at her best"" bullshit that just has me even more disappointed.

Now she says I've changed since I've been living with my fiancé, and accuses me of only pretending to be nice?

I give up. I know my mum, she will come around tomorrow or the day after, crying that I've upset her and to please forgive her and forgive my brother and be a happy family etc. but I'm so *done* right now. I try to bring up a serious issue, adn she turns it around on me and accuses me of all that crap? Accuses my *fiancé* of somehow changing me into a bad daughter? What the actual fuck?!

Some of these things are frustrating but normal, such as dyeing my hair or not being allowed to date, but a lot of these rules have made it hard to hang out with my friends outside of school, such as no sleepovers at other peoples’ houses, or in some cases, no visiting other peoples’ houses. It’s also hard to have friends over because in order for my parents to approve them, I have to ask them to act a certain way, which makes me feel as if I’m asking them to change for me. My parents, however, are insistent that I make my friends come over to our house or go somewhere that they approve of. I sincerely feel as if I have been missing out on something that most teenagers get to do. Sometimes I feel trapped in my own house. 

I have a boyfriend now. I love him so much. Of course, my parents don’t know. While they like him, I am afraid of what they will do if they find out our true relationship. We have been close friends for a few years now, but our relationship has only been going for three months. He knows that my parents are strict and sees the toll it takes on me, therefore, he is convincing me to rebel- by secretly going out with him for extended periods of time. 

Despite the constant stress I feel from my parents, I still love them and the concept of me rebelling is hard. In my friend group, I’m the lucky one for having two loving parents who don’t have to worry about the bills. I feel like an ungrateful brat for even thinking about it, and I’m afraid I’ll become the problem child in the family if I follow through with it. Furthermore, I’m terrified of the consequences and the possibility one might be to be restricted from seeing him. 

But this inability to meet with my boyfriend regularly (we go to different schools) is hard. He’s the type of person that needs the other to be physically there. We’ve even thought about breaking up.  Sometimes, I feel like I’m caught between him and my parents. 

Boyfriend aside, I feel as if I’ll never be free from my parents. I can’t cut myself off from them just because I go to college (at least not emotionally) despite all the things I have to hide from them, such as my atheism, my sexuality, my gender identity, how trapped I feel. When I tried to talk about this to my mom, she just complimented me on how obedient of a child I was, which felt incredibly troubling. Even now, I’m trying to hold back tears as I write this.

2. Can I cut it now, but maybe not assemble the piece I'm building until it dries?
3. If I must let it dry, for how long should I let it dry? 
4. I purchased a wood moister meter. Is there a certain amount of moister that is acceptable?

The wood will be used to build an outdoor patio table if that helps.

Thanks! Love this community. :)",woodworking,Question: Using wet wood purchased from outdoor lumber yard. Let it dry?

The table part is finished, I just have to finish the shelves. I've noticed that the wood began to warp since I began building it. It's in the basement, and I went for a rustic, antique look anyways, so I'm not terribly concerned that everything isn't super straight and perfect. (FYI, no water issues in the basement) But I want my future works to be more precise. Speaking with a friend who dabbles a bit, he said the wood wasn't finished drying and it'll warp as it dries. Again, being just a basement laundry room table and my 1st ever project, I went with pine so it wouldn't be expensive. So for future projects should I pick more expensive, better quality wood?

To preface this, I wholeheartedly believe that everybody is worthy of love and deserves support, kindness, and second/third/etc chances. Nobody is perfect and we all make mistakes. With that said, I am in a relationship with somebody I don't love. There were problems in the past and he is getting better, and I really appreciate that he is trying to work on himself, but the point is, I don't love him. And nothing that has happened in the past few years has changed my mind on this. However, I consciously made the choice to give him a chance. I need to also add that I had initially rejected him, whereupon he completely freaked out and said things like, ""I need you"", ""You led me on"", and threatening self-harm.

We both live with our respective parents in a very expensive part of the country, and over these past years, I would regularly drive over an hour to visit him. We both work, I am a scientist, he is a part-time tutor and taking classes at a community college.

A couple significant examples that I've rationalized why I don't love him:

* We have completely different sex drives. I am almost certain that I am asexual. Meanwhile, he recently admitted to me that he is addicted to porn. In the beginning of the relationship, I told him that I am asexual and that I may not ever want to have sex with him, which he ""accepted"" by telling me, ""I am willing to wait for you"". Up until now, we have had several major conflicts revolving around my refusal to even try to have sex with him, or to figure out why I am so averse to having sex in general. Sometimes he'll start going on about how I'd only want to have sex with a ""10/10 perfect Ryan Gosling/Brad Pitt sort of man."" There was one time where I did acquiesce -- because if I've never done it, how would I know I don't like it? -- and the result was that he was unable to stay erect long enough.
* He doesn't know how to do simple skills like cook, file taxes, plan trips. We lived together in the early stages of our relationship, and I discovered that we have drastically different lifestyles, one of which is cleaning standards. I am the ""clean freak"" of the pair while he is content with leaving week-old dishes in the sink and leaving his clothes all over the floor. I would get sick of seeing the clutter in the sink and start doing them, upon which he would try to stop me and say, ""I'll do them."" Which is nice and all. But he wouldn't get around to doing them until the weekend, which I frankly just couldn't stand. I don't have high hopes that he will change these habits if we live together again. Understandable, because he has his living habits, I have mine.

Even if I did love him, these are signs of major incompatibilities. My parents generally stay out of my business, but recently they have been expressing concerns about my future with this man in regards to financial stability. They are warranted in these concerns because he has flat-out told me that, if his dad were to stop working, his entire family would fall into financial ruin. Among other things, he is also not medically insured, which I find rather worrying.

Anyhow, I've felt this way toward him for years. I tried to break up with him but was, long story short, sucked back into the relationship because I felt so bad for him I couldn't do it. He maintains that the worst thing I could ever do to him is to break up, and he has threatened suicide on multiple occasions. Additionally, he turns it around on me and that ""I lack empathy"" and ""I don't care about him"" and ""he is irrelevant and unimportant"" to me and on and on about how he's done and sacrificed so many things for us, while I take him for granted and prioritize other things in my life above him. The last few times that I went to see him, we became embroiled in discussion for so long that I ended up driving back home past midnight (when I have work the next morning) and I had severe mental breakdowns upon getting home.

**TL;DR: Is breaking up with somebody I don't love going against beliefs that everybody is worthy of love and deserves support, kindness, and second/third/etc chances? It's like I am sending the message, ""You aren't enough. You aren't worthy of love. You gave me your all and that wasn't enough and you deserve to be left on your own even after all your attempts to pick yourself up and better yourself."" Because he's done so much for me and I am unwilling to do the same for him.**",relationships,Boyfriend (27/M) says I (29/F) lack empathy because I don't prioritize him the way he prioritizes me.

&amp;#x200B;

I met my girlfriend one year ago in Feb, and we have been living together for 6 months now. While I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend and do think I love her and we get along so well, I have been feeling suffocated with this relationship. 1) I'm stuck in a dead end job in an expensive city (Sydney) and am looking to change this as soon as possible for my own wellbeing, I have literally cried tears of frustration while working here. If I move cities I will be unemployed initially as will my gf and I'm not in a financial position to support both of us while we both look for work.

2) My girlfriend wants to get married at least next year, I am in no way ready to get married in the next 3-5 years as I still want to be in a secure job and have my own home before thinking about marriage.

3) I feel like we rushed to stay together (while I enjoy living together) her visa will end this year October which means I will need to apply for a partner visa for her which will be anywhere from 3k to 7k+ additional cost for me to support this and I'm not sure if this is the best idea if I'm not looking to get married anytime soon.

TL;DR I love my girlfriend and enjoy being with her but I think I'm wasting her time and she should fine somebody who has the same goals and timeframe to support her.

t2_eh1s2,1553650638.0,b5ycpn,t3_b5ycpn,0,"If it weren’t for my little sister I undoubtedly would have cut off all contact with my parents years ago. My parents have always had a toxic, emotionally, verbally, physically etc. abusive relationship. They never tried to conceal the abuse, they would often rant about each other’s drug use/infidelity/suicidal threats in front of my brother [24M] and I in an attempt to make us dislike the other parent more. 

My dad was always an alcoholic but once he got into pain meds, we lost our apartment and were homeless living in various motels while I was in high school. He is currently in prison for starting some sort of Ponzi scheme and scamming people out of &gt;$600,000. He also took out a credit card in my name and racked up &gt;$17,000 worth of debt. 

My mom’s abuse was mostly physical and neglectful. I largly fended for myself as a kid cooking my own meals (which consisted almost exclusively of microwave TV dinners and ramen). She was incredibly physically abusive, she would consistently beat me for normal kid behavior such as running around or playing too loudly. I once fell down a flight of stairs as a five year old and instead of consoling me, she whipped me with a belt on my already swollen back because I wouldn’t admit that I had been playing on the stairs- I hadn’t been. I would often break down in tears begging for her to tell me why she hated me so much, but as I got older I just became more withdrawn and we barely spoke aside from her yelling at me and me complying.

I don’t mean to vent, I’m simply trying to capture the instability and toxicity of my parents. When I was 16, my mom found out she was pregnant and I was honestly devastated, at the time we were living in my grandmother’s 1-bedroom apartment with seven people and my dad had been missing for over a month. From the moment she told me she was pregnant I knew I had to step up and be the one to look out for my younger sibling. 

Unfortunately, I’ve been failing at protecting her so far. I left for college at 17 and was in another city for four years making it difficult to intervene. During this time, my dad’s abuse only got worse, at one point beating my mom so badly she needed physical therapy. My sister refers to this beating as “the bad day”. I purchased many books about helping children who have witnessed domestic violence and helping kids understand and talk about their emotions but my mom throws them out every time.

Things have been better since my dad has been in prison but my mom simply doesn’t know how to parent. I made it clear from my sister’s birth that if my mom lays a hand on her I will call child services, so my issue is more so with her neglect. She only cooks plain pasta/ramen for my sister, she never helps her with her homework or projects (if I don’t help her with her projects they won’t get done), she won’t put any effort into parenting at all and she refuses to do anything engaging with her. She does things that I find traumatic like “getting rid of” my little sister’s pet cats and hamster. My mom promised me that she wouldn’t let my dad live with them when he gets out of prison but she just revealed to me that he will be living with them upon his release.

I currently live on my own with my wonderful boyfriend in the neighboring city and I try to visit on a weekly basis to keep tabs on my sister but it’s honestly so emotionally triggering being around my mom. I talk to my sister about her feelings and help her do things that get her out of her comfort zone. I want to do more but I feel so paralyzed by the situation, I cry almost every train ride home from their apartment. 

I wish nothing more than to have my little sister live with me but I’m just a waitress drowning in student debt. I also don’t want her to leave her current school district because it’s amazing and going to such a good school was truly the only thing that kept me on the right track as a child. 

If anyone knows of any services that can help that would be amazing or any creative solutions for preventing my dad from living with them would be great too. Also how do I take a step back without feeling immense guilt?

We are very good together and have always been happy doing things like playing games together, watching movies every night, talking on phone, falling asleep together and all the things u do in long distance relationship. 

I also send her gifts sometimes but I can't really send whatever I want because her family checks it and she would get in trouble. She does send me really sweet gifts though like she made those cards which say 30 reasons why she loves me. 

She is very talented with doing homemade gifts, she also plays guitar and is the sweetest person I ever met. I think she is the best person I ever met even if we never seen each other in person and I feel true love with her and never been happy like this before. 

She is from Germany and I am from Slovenia. We decided to take a break to get some space from each other. My gf suggested it to think about how we can work this out and she needs to focus on school right now. 

First problem is that she is muslim and I am christian so her family wouldn't approve of us being together but she has a bad relationship with her family and wants to get away from them.

They are abusive and don't really let her do much. That is why she wants to get away from them and I would really love to help her out. 

We always talked about visiting each other and still haven't done it. She can't visit me because parents wouldn't allow her to go anywhere during holidays.

We planned that she gets a job first because she is still studying. I told her to focus on her life goals first, move out and I come to her then.

I still haven't learned German language and that is my fault. Maybe I should use this space to work on what we promised each other.

I suggested that we should visit each other few times after she moves out and we can decide where to live then. 

I also offered that she can come to live in my country if she ever struggles in Germany because I already settled down and have my own home here. 

She refused this option and wants to stay in Germany even if I offered to pay for her and everything because has planned her future there.

Is the only option that I learn German and get a job there and move in with her? I don't see any other way of this working but she said that it will take too long till she moves out and wants to have time for herself a little now.

I really love her a lot and would do anything for her but sometimes I feel like I am more sure about us than she is. 

She tells me stuff like that wouldn't want me to leave my family behind because I have good relationship with them but I said many times that I don't have a problem with that. At the same time she tells me I am love of her life, she wants to get old with me and build a family

I (26F) and my boyfriend (27M) have been together for 3 years. 

After college, I still didn't know what I wanted career wise. So my mom recommended me to a part time retail job and that's where we first met.

We hit it off very well. I started dating him thinking it would wouldn't be serious, but I ended up falling in love. Before college, I didn't have a lot of confidence in myself and would stick to boys just because they were nice to me and showed interest. This is the first relationship I actually wanted and went after instead of passively following. 

For the most part he's wonderful. I feel genuinely appreciated and listened to. He's caring, attentive, funny, and conversation is always stimulating. If I tell him something is wrong, he usually takes steps to improve. We do a lot together and have similar interests. We both want to get married and have a family in the future. Being with him, just feels... right. Until it doesn't, and I get a sinking stomach feeling.

So what's the problem? First, he's still at that retail job while I am moving up in the industry I truly want. He's been applying with a few interviews but that's it. He doesn't know what kind of job he wants; only that it ""pay enough to live comfortably and something he's not ashamed of, preferably white collar."" I pass along job postings he might be interested in, but nothing has panned out. We both live with our parents because the area is expensive, but this also means that there's added pressure to find full time work with benefits. The lack of a prestigious job and living at home puts a strain on his relationship with his family.

Second, he could be more emotionally mature. He has exploded or shut down when he's really, really upset. Given time alone he will calm down and talk though.

Third, neither my parents nor my friends think I should stay with him. (I live far from my best friends but we talk a lot) Whenever the idea of breaking up pops in my head, it's almost always because of someone else pointing something out.

But I have always felt we have been able to talk through our problems. And he has shown actions towards improvement in his attitude and admits he has a problem. He's only just now relunctantly considering therapy, even though his issues are beyond what I can help with. I feel like I shouldn't have to hold his hand or do the work for him to get his life together; but is it worth all of the strife to keep the 90% of our relationship that makes me happy?
 
TLDR; Do I give my stuck in a rut boyfriend a chance to improve against everyone's advice or do I break it off before we get even more entangled?

t2_3adzf7xn,1553554224.0,b5hptk,t3_b5hptk,140,"Ok, so I have this friend. He’s a great buddy! There when you call, there when you don’t. We run errands together, push each other towards our goals, always on the hunt for a new restaurant to try. We’re best buds. 


But, I am beginning to feel like a raging asshole. To preface this, I will say I am usually not a judgmental person. Typically, I’m the one saying, “hey, who cares if you can’t sing? Belt it if it makes you happy!” Or “can’t dance? So what! Boogie woogie!” So I’m having trouble coming to terms with the fact I am a judgemental hypocrite who wants my pal to stop singing, even though he clearly enjoys it. 


It all started about 1.5 years into our friendship.
I was singing along to a song I really enjoy in the car and he complimented my voice. I talked about how I used to do choirs and lessons, and how I wish I had taken it further. He nodded along and then said, “yeah, I never did lessons. But I don’t think I would ever need to - no one has ever said I have a bad voice so I must be pretty great.” 
I giggled at that, assuming it was a joke. He isn’t usually so boastful and overly-confident. 

But then, guys.. then he opened his mouth and began belting out the remainder of the song as proof. It was loud, it was off key, it was raspy and awkward and probably the worst thing I’ve ever heard. But there’s a *reason* why I couldn’t stand it. Usually I can deal with people happily singing along to a song without hitting a single note. I find it endearing. My boyfriend can’t carry a tune but when he sings I actually get really happy and stop to listen. 

The thing that made me cringe into my seat while listening to my friend was the *effort* he was putting into it. Almost like he was so confident he was a pro he was gracing me with his angelic voice. 
He was wildly screeching high and low to hit notes but his voice was faltering, he was doing this incredibly strange “raspy” thing as though he was a boy band performing a teen bop song to girls and trying to be sexy. He was pushing his voice so much I thought it may fall off the edge. It was so uncomfortable to me. 

But who am I to judge? So I shut my yap and let him go, figuring after the song we’d never have to bring it up again.
But ever since that day he *always* sings. It’s like I opened the floodgates. I don’t even sing anymore because if I even begin to hum he starts belting out the lyrics in the same cringey way. I don’t want to encourage it, which sounds *so* mean! I feel awful. 

I tried to practice what I preach at the beginning; for a few weeks I endured the horrendous awkwardness. But then I noticed it had began making him *more* confident since I never said otherwise. He was upping the theatrics with each song, pushing even harder, carrying on long notes that would have the most awkward flair to them. 

I switched tactics and tried gently stopping it when I could. I’d begin to ask a question when he starts to distract him, changing the station once the song ends to prevent another he knows coming on, gently asking if I can hear the song playing because I love the singer, asking if we could halt the music because my head hurts. Each and every time I feel like a ripe asshole. But it wouldn’t matter, because any opportunity that opened for singing he took. I once even lied and said my car radio was broken for a few weeks to have some peace... 


I’m writing this because at this point I don’t know what to do. I’m almost beginning to get an anger response when he begins to sing, and I’ve never experienced that before. A wave of anger, annoyance, pity, awkwardness, and guilt hits me all at once. I dig my nails into my palms and smile the cringe away. 


But who am I to tell someone they suck at singing? Maybe his girlfriend loves his voice, the way I love my bf’s. Maybe singing brings him the utmost joy and I’d be stamping on his heart to ask him to stop.

It’s not like I can claim I don’t enjoy listening to singing since I opened my mouth and said I do it myself. I just don’t know how to combat this, because at this point I’m avoiding being alone with him. No car rides with the radio, no hanging out at home where it’s safe to sing. Now I’m always doing things in public with him where it isn’t socially acceptable to impersonate young Justin Bieber at the top of your lungs. 


But he’s noticing. He’s asking why we never hang out alone anymore, or why we haven’t been to each other’s place in so long. I miss hanging with my best friend. But I can’t do another off-key rendition of a Maroon 5 song in its entirety.


Am I an asshole? Is it my place to say *anything*? Should I keep it to myself? Should I gently inform him he sounds like a garbage disposal claimed a kazoo? Is there a way to not stomp on his feelings and also never have to hear him sing again? 



TL;DR- 
Dear friend seems to think he is an amazing singer. The second hand embarrassment from listening to him try has begun to consume my sanity. Should I say something, just keep avoiding any chances he could sing, or swallow my judgmental feelings and let him sing to his hearts content?


  EDIT; Really didn’t expect this story to be enjoyed enough to need an edit! I was asked for an update. Still not 100% how I’m going to go about it, but I think I’ll invite my buddy over and when the singing inevitably begins I’ll segue into addressing it. Knowing myself I’m going to wing and ruin both of our lives, but here’s to communication between pals!

Who would risk and change the dynamic of a close friendship for just a hookup right? So I've slowly come to reframe our relationship as just friends with benefits. I've asked him to be exclusive twice and been rejected twice. At this point, I'm so sure he doesn't feel anything romantic towards me. I can feel myself liking him more and more and the thought of him being with other girls now makes me sick to the stomach and all anxious. Despite all the reasons why he's bad for me and all the reasons why I shouldn't be dating anyone in general the feelings keep growing. And I don't text him outside of making plans to hang out. I see him once every 1-2 weeks. I don't know if I should just confess so that way I've burned the bridge. Or what I even want. He's not even that great a friend to me after everything we've been through (pre hookup and post hookup). I've really needed him after some tough times and been ignored so if anything I don't even know if he's a friend worth keeping.

t2_3hlzb9l7,1553663612.0,b60dl7,t3_b60dl7,11,"To start things off, my girlfriend and i get along very well, have a lot in common and hardly ever fight or get into arguments. That being said we've had a lot of talks recently about why we aren't getting along like we used to. I like to communicate and get everything out there and she isn't as open with her emotions. We talk constantly but everything stays light hearted and doesn't have much depth. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm extremely sweet to her and always looking for ways to do small things to make her day just a little bit better. She's going through an associates degree at the moment so she doesn't have a full time job or any kind of steady income. So me having a full-time career i make ends meet and financially support her willingly and am very modest about it(apart from telling this story) because i know she feels like she isn't pulling her weight. I know she plans to help out with rent and groceries and bills someday, but it's totally ok for now. Not sure if that a factor of her possibly leading me on until she gets on her feet. She's had pretty bad boyfriends in the past wrapped up in drugs, and alcoholism and emotional abuse. She's told me she loves me and i'm the nicest, most caring boyfriend, with motivation and a job he loves and that she couldn't ask for anyone better than me.

&amp;#x200B;

So we've been dating for 2 1/2 years now and just in the past year things have been going downhill. We still get along great but we have conversations frequently about why she seems to be losing emotional attachment with me. I always initiate the conversations and she doesn't like getting out what she's thinking most times. It takes some time me being quite sympathetic and the first conversation basically ended with her telling me, "" I just don't feel as connected with you anymore, and i don't know why."" It was pretty devastating for me and was a hard pill to swallow. Thats all i've gotten from her whenever the conversation comes up. We talk and it gets better for a week, maybe a month and then it starts going downhill again. I just start to feel it. She stops giving a crap about anything, mostly small chores and the majority in showing any kind of affection. No more kisses out the door, i love you or good nights, butt slaps, cuddling, breakfast in bed, hugs.. all small things but the lack of all at once is troubling to me. I love doing these things with her and she used to as well. She generally tells me she forgot or is busy, ""gotta run"" "" i didn't think of it,"" and then becomes closed off. We hadn't had sex for 2 months and i lightheartedly brought the up idea and she got defensive and said, "" i don't think of it everyday you know."" I try constantly with her and it always comes down to her saying she wants to try and make our relationship work, but the caring goes out the window fast and i'm just a loss for what to do and try next. I want it to work out between us but to be completely honest i've been becoming emotionally exhausted being the only one who wants things to work. I'm not sure how many more times i can try to keep things going before i just say screw it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rewind a little.. when we first met we were sex fiends, her moreso than me by far, but thats dwindled down in the past year to almost non-existent. Sex isn't everything to me at all, it would just be nice to have a little reciprocation from time to time. To know she's thinking about me that way every now and again would be amazing. If anyone try to initiate intimacy its always me. To get it out there we had a little trouble at the start of our relationship and I contracted genital herpes from her, her not knowing she had it from her previous cheating boyfriend from what she's told me. It was a bit devastating for the both of us but it seemed to draw us even closer after we found out. We don't talk about it anymore it's just kind of a thing in the back of my head. I don't feel like i'm stuck with her, i really do love her, but i feel like i may not have too many options if i got back into the dating scene, and it scares me. If we split i think i'd just feel completely lost.

&amp;#x200B;

We've talked a little about someday getting married, and in the past it sounded like a great idea, but as of recent i can't really see myself being happy if this is the way things will continue to progress. I know its easy to say we should just cut the cord and be done with it, but i really want it to work and at times it seems like she does as well. I just wish things were how they used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'd appreciate any advice, i just feel like i don't know what to do next and i don't want to just call it quits and kick her out.

t2_3hi6t7cu,1553641794.0,b5wrfx,t3_b5wrfx,2,"For a little background. I was a hellion when I was 19-21.  I left for California twice. (We live in Kansas City). I’ve accrued multitudes of debt (which he paid off and subsequently I paid him back). Student loans. Credit cards. The works.  

I left because my father and I were constantly fighting and arguing and I thought it would be best to escape half a country away.

They were mistakes I made in the past. I’ve grown up a lot in that time. I’ve nearly paid off all my debt, (45k in medical bills, 23k in student loans and 17k car). I’ve got 3k left on my car and everything is paid back and paid off. It’s been a hell of a 5 years to get everything paid off. 

I made tons of sacrifices to make it happen. 

The problem stems from every single argument my dad and I have, he always brings up my past, a past I have fought every single day to correct and now want to forget. I’ve told him repeatedly, that I’ve paid him back and to stop mentioning those times. He refuses to listen. 

He will not treat me with any form of respect or propriety. He says I’m ungrateful and no other parent would have done what he did. He has it in his mind that he’s this benevolent person that does things out of the kindness of their heart. Yet is the first to bring up my shortcomings and his solutions to them. 

I know reddit, I’m 27 years old and still living at home. I’ve been correcting that mistake every single day and have been trying to fight for my independence, but he keeps making me out to be the bad guy when I want to leave and start my own life. 

I am tired of fighting him. Tired of all the snarky remarks he makes and I can’t say shit back because it’s his house and I’m a guest here. I haven’t had any girls over because I respect his house. I respect him, he does not respect me, always bringing up my past even though I’ve corrected those mistakes. 

TLDR; my father and I have an incredibly poor relationship and no amount of fixing it helps. I’m at a loss as to what to do.

When she came back from the clinic she told me she got a blood test for std since we never got tested since we got together which was 1.5 years ago and didn’t even get checked for being sick or her vagina. Then she mentioned to me how horrible it is if someone cheats and gets std and gives it to their SO. Then she tells me to get tested too and I’m just confused. Am I being paranoid?

Oh and she said we can’t have sex because she ovulating. Which she’s never ever said before so somethings changed I’m just not sure what. Oh and her ovulation was last week, I keep check with my Fitbit so I can surprise her when her period comes with small gifts.

TL;DR my girlfriend randomly got std test and I’m confused and paranoid

Edit: So it turns out her thought process was we had lots of partners in the past (me and her) that she should check if we had stds since we didn’t get tested before we got together. I still think it’s quite odd to do after 1.5 years. She says her vaginal infection is gone now so that wasnt the reason to visit the clinic the sole reason was STD/STI blood tests.

t2_3gyxrmdg,1553662304.0,b606y7,t3_b606y7,4,"Me and my boyfriend have been dating for about 2 and a half years now.
He displays odd behaviour at times.
I am starting to think he’s a sociopath and i think i’m just too blinded to realize it or maybe i’m jumping to assumptions. 
He doesn’t seem to care about my feelings at all. We got into an arguement earlier where i caught him in a lie, and i confronted him with the lie. Yet he told me to get over it. Sometimes i will tell a small white lie but i’ll follow up with the truth and he’ll act hurt and say stuff like “so you lied to me” stuff like that.
Anyways, after i showed him what he said to me he was telling me he was blocking me and it seemed like he was taunting me because he was saying things like “any thing you have to say before your permenantly blocked”.  Not blocked right now but i’m getting the silent treatment. 

It seemed like he was trying to flip the situation on me or get me to stop talking about it by using threats. He then told me he was going to do something just to spite me. I notice a pattern in him, and he does it alot. I am a very sensitive person, the littlest things can hurt me and sometimes when i am crying he acts like he doesn’t care. I can hear it in his tone that it doesn’t matter to him. Sometimes i think my emotion makes him uncomfortable. There are times when he cares but the times he doesn’t greatley overlap. Dating him is horrible i am now realizing signs i didn’t notice before. 

He used to hurt me on purpose, sometimes it seems like he’s ignoring me to punish me. I looked up signs of being a sociopath. He shows all the signs of being one. I wanted to chalk it up to him being just generally mean or selfish but am starting to think its not as simple. He recently made me a promise and didn’t keep it and now he’s acting like he never made it. Dating someone with no empathy is a deal breaker, i need to be able to talk about my feelings and i need to be able to be listened to without judgement or contempt  for having feelings. i don’t know if i hate him. But like there really is nothing left for me. I let this go on for 2 years, i view this as partially my fault as to why im suffering. My anxiety is off the walls. I can’t go out and do normal stuff i could before. I never expierenced this kind of anxiety in other relationships. 

Lastly, i don’t know what steps to take to leave. I realize i am an insecure person but i’ve had this issue in alot of my relationships. I don’t deal with break ups well i don’t know how to move on unless my hand is forced into doing so. Normal people can say we’re done, this isnt working out for me good luck in life. And yes it does hurt them but it seems like they live with that and understand that. I attempt to break up and retreat on my word and so continues this cycle of me not knowing how to move on. I do not know how to let go in a healthy way. I can’t block and move on thats too hard for me too. I know what i need to do i cant do it so I‘m starting to think therapy is the only thing that is right for me? Does anyone have any advice or anything similar they had to go through?

But I got sick of talking about it so I just said fine whatever do homework together and that should be strictly it and I would like the respect of knowing when they do, do homework together. This never happened they did homework all the time and he never followed up with his agreement. Now at this point I’m just fed up with them hanging out all together she’s asking him to go get groceries with her and shit and then to study after like there’s HELLA no need for that. Am I crazy or am I right cuz this shits pissing me off for some reason and I don’t feel like dealing with it even though it’s not that deep. I wanna smack them both.

He's understanding and supportive. One of the only issues in my relationship has been that I was more qualified (study/ work wise, we are in the same field so its a direct comparison sometimes). However, we talk about it a lot and how it makes us feel and we've been able to ignore what people have to say and make it work. I did feel a lack of intellectual stimulation sometimes, but the emotional support and care I get from more than makes up for it. I did have intellectual stimulation in some of my past relationships but I realized its not enough to make it work in the long run. 

Coming to now, we've been talking seriously about getting married and do a very short engagement and a small wedding. My sister was getting married last month and we invited his parents out of courtesy. Our parents had met earlier separately (my bf and I live on a different continent than our home country). His parents decided to attend. I was quite anxious about it because not much of my extended family and friends knew of our relationship and I was worried it would become the talk of the wedding and steal thunder from my sister. I raised this to my bf but he didn't take it seriously. In fact every time I brought it up he told me I was being unreasonable and society doesn't work this way. 

Well the wedding weekend came, and exactly what I had feared happened. Everyone kept talking about my relationship at my sister's wedding which made me feel really hurt for her because she has lived in my shadow a lot already. I told this to my bf and how angry it made me feel WHILE I was at the pre wedding function and he did not take it seriously even then. My future Mother in law went around everyone telling all she knew about our relationship and how excited she is for our wedding. I am an EXTREMELY private and just having people gossip about me was another wound I could not bear. 

After the wedding was over, I was telling my bf how angry and hurt I was and he still told me I was over reacting. I was just beyond hurt so I told him I want to call it off. Only then did he realized how serious I was and got concerned. We went to normal a week or so later but I still feel my MIL's behavior at the wedding was unacceptable (she was clicking pictures of me in front of everyone, just behaving very immaturely). I brought it up again in some conversation and my bf flipped out and said if he thinks my MIL should shut up then I should too. I thought those are 2 completely different scenarios- my MIL was talking in public in front of strangers, while I was talking to my bf. 

I should mention that I am normally a very honest person in close relationships (with my family/ partner). Many times I come across as rude, but eventually I've mostly seen people appreciate my honesty over long run. In casual settings or with friends/ acquaintances, I am of course polite and do the usual society required niceties. 

This incident or my attitude is seriously affecting my relationship. What should I do? Please help me see this clearly.

Originally he wanted to go out to eat after helping me move it, and I assumed I was going to pay, but then after we got done moving it he said he didn't want to because he'd only gotten 2 hours of sleep the night before, and insisted on giving me the food he bought at McDonald's for lunch because we weren't able to go to a restaurant, even though I told him repeatedly that I don't eat meat.

When he helped me move the couch, he gave me a random book he owned. The next day he sent me like 12 text messages, including one asking if I had started on the book yet and another about going out to eat.

Today he texted me around the time he got into work (I had already been there for a while) and said he had a housewarming gift for me. The ""gift"" was some mixed nuts, another random book, and a diet soda. He told me that the mixed nuts are so I can keep my strength up (WTF?).

Tonight, about half the time he'd pass by me at work he'd try to talk to me, even if I was obviously in the middle of something. He asked me if I've read Catcher in the Rye and started talking about giving me a copy of it. I have no interest in ever reading it or any other book he might want to give me.

I feel kind of bad because now it's going to seem like I was just using him to move the couch to my new place, but if he didn't act the way he's acting I'd actually feel like socializing with him. He seemed kind of fun to talk to before I really got to know him.

So we have been dating for around 4 months, we met at work, I asked her out, and so we went on a date. It went really well, we connected, and I ended up staying the night at her apartment. Well, she was the first girlfriend I had ever had, and so I stayed most of the next day over there, my phone having died the night before. Well, my parents freaked out, thinking I had died or something, and so they put out a missings person's report for me because the couldn't contact me, due to my phone being dead. Well they finally got a hold of me, I was embarrassed as hell, I went back to my house. But thankfully, she wasn't mad at me or anything, and so we stayed together. This is, however, where her hatred of my family began.

Fast forward a bit, everything is going great, we are moving rather fast but we both wanted to so there was no problem. I stayed most nights over at her house. During this time I quit my job so I was kinda just waiting for classes to start up again. My parents were mad at me because they rarely saw me, as I was always over there because I was all love struck and stuff. So, during that time my parents and I weren't on the best terms, so I vented about them to, let's call my girlfriend Megan. She agreed with me that they were being ridiculous, however also during this time she met them, and so while Megan didn't think the best of them, she didn't hate them.

Fast forward a few more weeks, the relationship between my family and I is mostly repaired, and I went over there a bit more often, which seemed to make Megan angry, thinking that I wanted to spend time with them rather than her, which wasn't true, I just simply wanted to spend time with my family. Then I fucked up big time. I realized that I had kinda lost myself in this relationship one day, as I still had no job, I was running out of money, I had stopped working out and eating well, etc. I went home the day I realized all of this stuff, and before I went over Megan had gone on a rant to me, complaining about how I always defended my parents, as she believed that they were always talking shit on her, where as I know my family and I knew that wasn't going on, so to say the least I wasn't in the best state of mind. Well I went over to my house and kinda went on a rant, talking about all of the bad things and how I was tired of Megan doing this and that. Well, I felt horrible about it, went back to Megan's house, told her what I did and she was extremely pissed, understandably, but we worked through it and that whole ordeal is pretty much over with. 

Now for the present, but a bit of background before these statements. We had always planned to stay together forever, as we both really loved each other. Due to this, I think I have ignored some things about her, and now I am fully noticing them. She has always smoked pot, like up to 14 bowls a day sometimes, and when she is sober, she has the shortest temper and gets annoyed at me extremely easily. She hates my family and wants nothing to do with them. One example is that I brought over meat that my mom gave me, it was old but it had been frozen long before it expiration date. She flipped out, saying my parents are trying to put a rift between us by giving me that old meat, even though I was just going to eat it because I knew she wouldn't want to eat it. If I'm ever in a bad mood or just being to quiet, she gets in a bad mood instantly and get mad at me because I'm either in a bad mood or if I'm just being too quiet. She also is quite racist at times, she uses a lot of racial slurs and basically doesn't like anyone but white people. Now in the past, I think I was blinded by my love of her so I pretty much ignored all of those things, but recently I have been finding them more and more annoying, and I can't help but be in a bad mood or quiet around her when she goes off, which can make it worse. I feel bad staying in this relationship if I'm unhappy because I know that it will also make her unhappy eventually, but at the same time I dont want to leave because know that would hurt her greatly too. I'm just lost, we are just so much more different than I originally thought, I'm such a passive and patient person, and she is the exact opposite, and the way she treats other people sometimes makes me mad. Wow that was much longer than I originally wanted.

What I mean is I don't feel any sort of attraction to these guys. Not physically at all, not emotionally. I am usually surprised by thier choices. I'm not so vain that I keep standards for an SO too high, but is it too arrogant to ask to meet some. I know it's not all attraction but shouldn't one start with a bit of it? It feels awful that I have to defend my opinions and get shamed for having any. 
They must be lovely people. But am I wrong in saying what I know won't work for me? It leads them to being really upset and making me feel like I am wrong in even pointing out something as 'trivial' as that. I feel shamed by my mother when she says 'marriage is not all looks'. I agree. But it is not also mutual compatibility?

But they make it seem like it's my saying no that has 'delayed' their daughter's wedding. Which at the moment is their only tragedy.

t2_3gl5km2c,1553659493.0,b5zs3v,t3_b5zs3v,9,"Hi, so a bit of backstory we've been together around 9 months and at the beginning, as always, everything was great. Arguments begun due to bad mental health, or medication, or whatever other excuse and the resentment set in. 

My issue in regards to breaching trust is that, regardless of whom is actually in the wrong or whatever when a situation happens, he will call a friend or his family and tell them EVERYTHING. This includes telling his friends my very private, sensitive potential mental illness diagnosis or speaking to his grandma about our sex life (!!!) he never asks for permission and I find it disturbing. When I try to tell him this, he says he can't deal with situations without getting a second opinion. I understand this however I have seen some messages (we use each others phones for different things) where he is flat out saying I am lying about his behaviour to his mother, for example (in that, a situation I told him happened when he was drunk? He denied and made me out to be a liar). Through this he also sent her screenshots of our private conversation again without permission.

Speaking of alcohol...he is incredibly touchy seemingly only with me when drunk.  He is incredibly confrontational and can start fights over quite literally nothing and then pin blame on myself if I try to discuss it. For example, he had an argument with his friend.  Ever trying to be helpful I tried to explain to him the friend's point of view (my bf is autistic so can struggle with this). He immediately took offence as if it were MY opinion, drowned me out by shouting 'BLAH BLAH BLAH' like a toddler (26!!) and has been mean to me since.  This includes saying he can't be arsed with me, asking me to shut up etc anytime I ask him not to be mean to me.

At what point will it stop? I feel I'm controlling if I try to say what he tells other people and he makes me feel as such, but surely he could at least ask permission before telling our mutual friends my confidential info?

Is it so much to ask that he stops drinking, if it's causing so much hassle?   This happens almost every time he drinks now, last time he threatened the friend over a petty argument and punched walls in the house 15-20 times.

I really did love this guy but I'm at my wits end but can't help but feel I don't deserve this yet its always made to seem like it's my fault and I'm crazy for thinking otherwise.

Do I go and be homeless? Will he change with enough guidance? ",relationships,My (19f) bf (26m) is a mean drunk and breaches my trust.

 TLDR at the bottom! Obvious mobile apology. Everything I have typed is 100% a tldr, but I left in the important details. 


  I have been friends with ‘Brandon’ for about ~4 years now. Brandon has been with me through some really very trying times, and he and I connect (as friends) on a deep level. This being said, Brandon has admitted to having feelings for me in the past, I have made it very clear that I am not interested and there hasn’t been any issues. So why am I suddenly wanting to drop him as a friend? Heres the backstory! 

  So Brandon doesn’t get out a whole lot, I hadn’t seen him in some time, so I texted him while at work and we made plans for dinner, I was also invited out by other friends and invited him to the bar with me. After we both got off work, we met up at my house and drove to the bar together in my car. 

  While at the bar it was actually pretty fun at first, however Brandon seemed to get caught up in talking to my friends a lot and ended up going and doing party things with the party people in their car. I’m a recovered addict so I stayed back because, while I’m not uncomfortable with people around me being inebriated in this manner, I tend to avoid being so myself. 

  It started to get a bit late, and I have work super early in the morning. I let Brandon know this, and he basically brushes it off at first but kind of seems concerned? This part is probably my fault because I definitely did not directly say “let’s leave right now because I’m tired, cold, and I have to get up for work super early.” However I certainly did not hide the fact that I was tired and cold and had to get up super early. It got to the point where I went to stand outside. Brandon and our friends follow me out. I mention wanting to leave and he asked if he could finish his drink. I said sure, because I’m not a complete asshole, but I’m going to go wait in my car until he’s done because I have anxiety and there’s too much going on. 

  This next part I’m going to break down to you in time increments so you can get a true feel for why it’s so bothersome to me: 

1:05 am- I get to my car, turn it on and lock the doors. 

1:10 am- I text Brandon to let him know I’m ready whenever. Some guy gets in his car next to me , which my spidey senses are hyper aware of for no reason. 

1:15 am: Guy from other car knocks on the passenger side window. I have heard enough true crime to know how this is supposed to go down. I roll my window down the tiniest bit and ask if he’s okay. This weirdo grills me on asking what I’m doing alone in the car, and tells me I’m cute. I say “thanks have a good night!” and  roll the window back up. Then I proceed to text Brandon and tell him I’m spooked tf out and can we please leave now. The guy is in his car next to me so I can’t leave mine. 

1:19 am : Brandon finally responds saying he’s in our other friends car and would be there shortly. 

1:30 am: the creepy asshole knocks on my DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW and does the same routine with me again. I tell him he’s being creepy and I want him to leave me alone. I’m freaking out and text Brandon who says he will be there in a minute. The guy gets in his car and drives away. I get a text from Brandon saying “oh, well he left so that’s good.” Meaning he was watching the entire ordeal go on.  Our friend who’s car he was in drove Brandon back over to my car. As I was hugging them goodbye I roughly mentioned the guy who had been knocking on my window. This friend who had been driving said something along the lines of “why didn’t you call or text me I had no clue this was happening I would have come park beside you!!” Which means Brandon hadn’t  mentioned the weirdo to them while he was watching him circle my car. 

This entire night has left such a bad taste in my mouth. Brandon and I have a trip planned out of town for my birthday. We are each supposed to be bringing our partners, however his girlfriend doesn’t know if she can go as the same for my partner. If this is how he chooses to act while in our home city then there is no telling what could happen in another city several hours away. 

  I have lost a lot of respect between these events and the conversation had on the ride home. I don’t feel anywhere near as comfortable around my supposed best friend, anymore. I really want to phase him out of my life, is this right to do so? What’s the best way to tell him I no longer want him on this trip with me alone without causing a bunch of drama? I feel so weird about this whole situation, is it possible I’m over reacting? TYIA for any advice on this circumstance. 

TLDR; my “best friend” put me in an uncomfortable situation, and now I don’t want to bring him on an out of town trip with me. ",relationships,Am I (21f) over reacting to wanting to phase out a friendship with my ‘best friend’ (23m) ?

I've had depression before from age 13 to 18 and have had a lot of therapy for it.

I'm having dreams of harming myself again or of him cheating etc. Its weird.

We have a good relationship and have a lot of dates and good talks. He has friends and family here and enjoys gaming where I can't even concentrate long to have a good time gaming with my friends. I just don't enjoy it anymore.


I told my partner this and he is very supportive and sweet and says I'm here for you sweety,  if you need anything etc and that he loves me etc. 


I'm just having the feeling of checking myself in or I need to do something.
I'm thinking about stuff I know I don't want to do but when I go down again with my thoughts I'm scared of what I will do.

t2_3hlowge6,1553658677.0,b5znm0,t3_b5znm0,3,"Let me start with the questions:
 1) Do soul mates exist? 
2) Did I find mine? 
3) What the hell am I feeling, or are WE feeling? Why do we feel this way. What’s happening?!?

So, my ex (23M) and I (23F) have known each other for almost 10 years now! We met when we were 14 when we were lab partners. We spent ALL of our time together and were best friends growing up until he started dating someone our Junior year. He told me he had feelings for me from the beginning, but I ignored them until our senior year. As soon as he broke up with his girlfriend, I did EVERYTHING to get him back. We dated for 2 years after that. We broke up in college when I moved to a different state, but our relationship was the most memorable, healthy, natural, and positive relationship I’ve ever been in. I literally have nothing negative to say about him. I still admire him deeply. 

Last year, we reconnected after almost a year of us both ending longterm relationships. He’d call every day and we’d talk for hours. After a few months, I finally flew up to visit him for a week and we saw our friends we grew up with and reconnected even more. THIS is what I’m MAINLY struggling with, and it’s so personal, but I need advice on this part mainly..

SO! Him and I hooked up one of the nights I visited him. It wasn’t just a hook up though. We were synced and there was a deep connection. Like there was still love there and it was incredibly emotional. It took me DAYS to comprehend what had happened, and every time I thought of him I had to snap out of the night I kept reliving. I was completely mind blown and we both stopped talking to each other immediately after. I felt like I was losing my mind- like I was crazy! I wanted to talk to him about it all, but I felt like I was the only one who felt that way since I’m a woman and I probably just got emotionally-attached right? I don’t believe in “the one” or “soulmates”. So I don’t know what had happened that night, but I have never felt that way since. 

I thought we’d never talk again, but he reached out a few weeks ago. It’s like nothing had ever happened, except he told me he’s been dating throughout the year and he told me he did a lot of growth. Out of no where, he told me he wants to see me. Not for sex or hooking up. He made that incredibly clear. WORD FOR WORD, he said, “It took me a year to realize what I deserve. I want to see you again. The last night I saw you I noticed a connection and I think something is still there and I need to see you. No one has ever made me feel the way you have or has treated me anywhere close to the way you did. You have been my healthiest relationship. I have never found someone with this kind of physical or emotional connection. I think it’s very possible something is still there.” Then he sent me his work schedule for the next 2 months and told me to pick a weekend where him and I can see each other and he already planned a whole day where it can just be him and I on his boat he just fixed up and at his favorite little antique shops and restaurants around the town. He told me he had never stopped thinking about me since we last saw one another and said it took him days to think it over, I DIDN’T TELL HIM ABOUT HOW I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM EITHER. My mind is racing. What’s happening!

What in the world is going on. Why do we BOTH feel this way STILL? Why did we feel such a deep connection when we were together? Uugghh. I’m so nervous! I’m seeing him in May!  

**TL;DR:
I dated a guy in high school, and he was my first love. We broke up because I moved to a different state. We got back into touch a year ago, saw one another, hooked up, and I haven’t been over him since. Tonight, he told me the same thing without me confessing first. He felt a deep emotional and physical connection since the night we were together and has thought about it every day since. He wants to see me again to see what’s still there, and not to hook up. He made that clear. Now I’m questioning everything I once believed. 1) True love is a myth and 2) There are no soul mates or “one”. But could there be?**",relationships,My ex [23M] and I [23F] have known each other for 10 years and he suddenly told me he knows what he deserves now. Are soulmates real..?
t2_2vf9ial4,1553658394.0,b5zm47,t3_b5zm47,2,"Like the title says, Aidan and I have been together for 4.5 years now. He's currently in his last semester at college, and I'm working.

We've both been incredibly busy this past month, me with my work, him with his projects at school &amp; finals next month, so we haven't been spending much quality time together. We also don't stay together, although we live 5 minutes' drive apart, so the times we do spend together lately is just grabbing a quick, convenient lunch or dinner outside.

Anyway, I had more free time this week as I concluded a huge proposal at work, whereas he had a deadline for a group project yesterday, which he and his friends had been working overtime on for the past week. At 7pm, he texts me, ""Finally submitted our paper! I'm beat."" I thought we could finally spend some quality time together, maybe grab dinner and netflix and chill at home, since he's going to be busy studying again soon. I was about to suggest it when he texted again ""I'm going to grab dinner and drinks with \[friends he had been working on the project with\].""

I was upset about it and told him, in which he apologized for ""not thinking about spending time with me instead"". Am I right to be hurt by it? If I had a long and tiring day at work, I'd love to see him even if it's just for a while. If I only had a little free time, I'd spend it with him and not with friends who I'd already been seeing for 7 days straight. Or am I expecting too much?

He never used to be like that. He used to want to spend all his time with me. I just feel him slowly pulling away and wanting to live his own life instead.

**TL;DR** **Boyfriend and I are incredibly busy so we haven't seen each other much.

I am 32F dating 34M for about 8 months now. He grew up with both parents working in white collar ""high level"" career jobs (PhDs), much more upper middle class, and I grew up with mom at home and dad going to work in a family business, mom helping with that business, more blue collar (immigrants, no college), less resources available and a more modest middle class life. My family never went hungry, but we also rarely took a vacation for 1-2 nights, we had enough for what we needed and wanted but we didnt want much.  His parents spent lots of time working, but took family vacations to Hawaii and the like, and bought lots of ""stuff"". Definitely two, not drastically, but different family lives.

My bf and I have never had a serious discussion about what we desire our own families to look like. He has said, more in passing, that career is important to him and important that his partner works/has a career. He has also said things along the lines of relying on the financial contribution that his partner will give to a life with him (that his salary PLUS his partners salary will create a more sustainable financial lifestyle that he wants).  I value time/freedom more than I value money. I understand money is essential, but I am very ok with living life on a smaller budget if that means more of my time is my own. I hate the idea of having kids and putting them in day care, and I would want to avoid that. I don't want someone else raising my kids, especially since we are of a minority and I want to raise them with our customs/language etc.

My girlfriend feels uncomfortable in public because I am smaller than her

I am 5‘8 (172cm) and she is 5‘11 (180cm).

We are currently having a big problem with her telling others that she‘s with me because she is extremly afraid that they might be thinking bad of her, because she is taller and we „do not fit“ from an outer appearence

I tried everything to show her that other people‘s opinion do not matter as long as she is happy but she keeps telling me that she can not be happy when other‘s think bad of her.

I am sure that our surroundings would not even care but I cannot convince her.

She always tells me that she just feels uneasy when in public with me because I am smaller

Any tips on how to fix this?

t2_dd5h0,1553644148.0,b5x6q8,t3_b5x6q8,17,"Full disclosure: I am probably not very smart in initiating this relationship, as all the issues mentioned in the title were already there. The mature thing to do would probably be to never have started this for the benefit of both parties, but here I am.

So I met her at work (perhaps another recipe for distaster, but it’s not easy to meet women, man). In fact, I kinda sit right next to her lol. We both have decent jobs. We have been dating for 3 months now, and have become very emotionally involved. 

I’ve been in my fair share of relationships, and I can say that she really makes me feel comfortable in my own skin so far. She’s extremely tolerant and our personalities are very alike. She’s sincere, genuine, and honest. She’s also very kind. My partner is not indian, but she has also shown great interest in the Indian culture and Hindu religion. She is the type of girl who would grace any home with her personality and her sincerity. 

Here are the issues. My partner has a 6 year old daughter. My mentality is, I am already 30. It makes no difference to me to eventually raise this daughter if I’m going to have children of my own. However, she has a 6 year old daughter lol, so I know it’s not easy. The daughters father is not on good terms with my GF. He’s been abusive in the past, and they have shared custody. I believe he pays child support, but she has a restraining order against him, so they don’t currently see each other. In my mind, as long as he is a good father to his daughter, and provides child support...I don’t mind. I realize that’s the best case scenario though, and it will probably be much more rough than that.

Another issue is that she has two dogs, one of them being a pit bull. She’s had them for a year. I have a cat, which is another disaster waiting to happen lol. Well, her dogs are not trained that well, and she has even said that she might have to give the pit bull to a special shelter so that they can train him (I believe the pit bull was somewhat abused by the ex). I do not want pets and have communicated this to her. I guess we were going with a “go with the flow and see what happens” kinda thing, but this might end up being a dealbreaker for me anyways down the road.

Well, I told my parents yesterday about her. Let’s just say they’re not happy. They are conservative Indian parents. (We live in America right now, and I was born and brought up here). Before some of you say “fuck your parents, your decision should be your own”, let me just say that it’s not easy. I love my parents and was raised with a lot of that same Indian cultural influence. I may be American, but I do have those Indian values that I would like to uphold.  Their reaction was to be expected. They don’t even want to meet her though...which breaks my heart.

I don’t really know what to do. I have received a lot of support from my friends, and she has met my brother and his wife. she even met his wife’s mom, who loved her. At the same time...my parents reaction and these issues are real.

If some of you DO feel that I should proceed, can you give me some ideas as to how I should approach the relationship starting now?

Thank you for your time.

**TL;DR: I found a good girl, but she’s also a single mother. She also has two dogs, which is not ideal for me (details in post). My Indian parents don’t want anything to do with that. I feel very uncomfortable to disobey them, but also to end this relationship which shows some promise.**

In both cases they had some sort of a crush on me and either they or their friends told me. Once I knew that, I asked them out. I was interested in both of them by the way -- I didn't just say ""well I guess so"".

Now I'm scared because I want to date someone, but I don't know how to (1) meet someone I'm interested in and (2) ask them out if I did find someone. I knew the two girls I dated pretty well before I asked them out, so it always felt like a natural progression to me. But going forward, I don't want to just keep hoping that someone will fall into one of my circle of friends that likes me.

If you can't tell, I don't have a lot of social experience. I focused pretty much all of my life on work/academics, but my last breakup was kind of a wakeup call that made me realize I want to start living life some more. I could use some help with that, maybe starting here.

I’m not sure how much background to type out.. Basically, I went through his phone for a stupid reason and ended up finding a text to his friend where his friend sent him a photo of this girl in December and he responded saying he “always wanted to fuck her” (this girl, who I actually happen to know) and even mentioned to his friend that she hits my girlfriend up all the time etc..


I don’t like his friends in general, they’re very immature and honestly only talk about women/sex in not really a great way, they all also happen to be single. My boyfriend is very mature for his age/in comparison in my opinion and I feel like I’ve noticed he engages in their behavior when he talks to them because he’s trying to fit in with them, and talks all the time about how he feels he’s outgrown them


I explained to him that it’s not okay because I’m sure he wouldn’t appreciate if I said that to one of my friends and I feel very hurt and betrayed, and he said he didn’t mean it, it was a joke. I said “wanted not want” I’m with you, you’re my girlfriend blah blah


Am I wrong to feel this way? This happened 2 days ago and I just can’t get over it, It’s honestly causing me a lot of anxiety and doubt in myself, not due to insecurity but I honestly think I’m great, not to be cocky but I find myself attractive, independent, almost done with school, and building a business. I’m extremely big on loyalty and I’ve always felt our relationship was perfect other than this.. I just feel hurt and disappointed. I understand he didn’t cheat on me and although he may have not meant it, it was said.. I feel nauseous, can’t eat, don’t even want to speak to him. He admitted he was wrong, apologized, said I was right and tried to comfort me but I don’t know what to do, I really love him.

t2_3f3y48qg,1553643972.0,b5x5mo,t3_b5x5mo,8,"I'm 33. I met a pretty 31yr old woman on a dating site. She told me she had two kids and had recently separated from her husband. I told her that I loved kids and would love to be a dad someday myself. 

She went on to tell me that she suffered from severe Anxiety and clinical depression and social anxiety. Thinking that I understood what these things were I said ""that's fine I don't judge and whatever you go through we will go through together"" 

She said great so, what are you looking for? I said, ultimately, a wife and kids someone a can settle down with and have a family with. But for now I'd settle for just having someone to come home to that loves me. 

Also, I must admit I need sex at least twice a day. But, I love catering to my woman. I will cook, clean, pay the rent and Bill's and help with the kids then turn all my attention to you and rub your feet and do all that you ask so essentially,  just take care of me sexually and I'll do all the rest. 

There will never come a time where you awake beside me and feel as if I dont love you. She laughed and said that was fine and that she was looking for a man just like me. I then said that I also walk with a limp like the guy from the series House and unfortunately,  there is nothing I can do to change it. And that I was sorry. 

She laughed and said don't be silly all I care about is your heart and well you are good looking so that does help I smiled and all seemed to go well... I WAS WRONG! as it would seem I had absolutely no idea what any of these things were or their severity. 

I kept my word... I paid the rent and utilities I cooked and cleaned by the time she got home her kids were already fed and bathed and put down for bed. And her food was hot and ready along with her coca-cola  at which point I rubbed her feet while she ate. And showered her with all my love and attention. I did all that she asked and she still wanted more. 

I would later find out that she was also bipolar. One minute she loved me and the next she'd break down in tears claiming she didn't love me and wanted me to leave. Then I found out that she quit her job claiming that she didn't want to do anything but sit on the futon and be held by me... literally. 

Also, I am mixed half Italian and half black. And I would later come to discover that she has a racist grandfather that not only doesn't like black people but hated mixed people even more saying that mixing of the races should never happen and that I was an abomination and that as long as she would continue to date me he would disown her and her children and cut her and the kids out his will and he was true to his word. 

Until she suggested that she just tell him that we were no longer together and she just hide me in the bedroom when he comes over foolishly I agreed but then began to realize my self worth and told her that I no longer wished to hide and she grew angry saying that she wasn't going to be cut out the will and if I loved her I'd understand. 

She would later be pregnant by me but stated the she she has a weak heart due to her second pregnancy and that the doctor said he advised against it for the odds of it killing her were pretty high also, she didn't want to be disowned by her grandfather. 

I broke down in tears as this would have been my first child and I want to be a dad more than anything but, reluctantly... I agreed with her wishes.  And now I would just like to hear your comments is it ok to give up and try to find someone better?

t2_3hllolml,1553657247.0,b5zft1,t3_b5zft1,4,"Hey, reddit. Throwaway account since my dad could be lurking and I don't want him to link this to me. Hence why some ages and details are tweaked a bit.  

Anyhow, let's get to it. My (25) dad (54m) used to an amazing person - difficult to discern his real emotions but always calm, collected, loved reading, has three Master degrees in various fields, his hobbies included writing, philosophy, theology, etc. For the first 20 years of my life he has been my role model but recently he has started going through an awful midlife crisis which only has progressively gotten worse.  I honestly don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

So I left home 5 years ago to study abroad and dad kinda had a hard time coming to terms with it. He and I used to be very close, he was my best friend and we hung out a lot when mom worked night shifts at the hospital. He always asked me stuff about school and would discuss what I learned, I used to share with him stuff about my life, friendships and relationships and he would always support me or give me sensible advice. He kinda did it the first two years in uni too but then he started getting more and more uninterested in everyting. It's not because he doesn't understand what I am studying (it's history, which is one of his hobbies and one of his MAs), he just doesn't care. My mom (50 f) and sister (18 f) also told me he had started drinking more and more, and dropping all of his hobbies. He no longer reads, writes or does gardedning. Now he only scrolls through his fb or insta and texts some people. 

&amp;#x200B;

He has always been judgy but he has never been mean. Since recently, he started being really rude and mean to my mom and sister. My sister had a sudden bacterial infection which hit her whole body and she was in critical condition for days. Throughout the whole time he would call her or me and cry that she is dying and then call mom and blame her that sister is in critical condition. At the same time my mom is working two shifts at the hospital, taking care of my sister, taking care of our pets and cleaning the house. He is just sitting at home after work, drinking, calling us and worrying us more and then doing nothing. He went as far as to say my mother is stupid and this is all from her stupidity. I was baffled. They may have had their differences but I never heard them fight in the 20 years I lived with them.  Not to mention that name calling and overall offenses were never part of our household. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this he acts like a teenager. He is always sarcastic, rolls his eyes at mom or sister when they ask or tell him something he might not sligltly like. Guilt tripping and manipulation are his fortes now, giving the silent treatment to my sister or mom when they don't agree with him. He prefers hanging out with my cousin (14 m) and makes super inappropiate jokes expecting people to laugh and when they don't, he says they're dumb for not understanding him. I have told him I don't like him to put me on speaker when I call him if he hasn't asked me but he does it anyway. I call, he puts me on speaker without letting me know and starts asking me how much money I make, how much is my scholarship and then starts giggling with his collegues (whom i can hear saying that i would get mad if i knew i am on speaker). Seriously??? Other examples of his behaviour include me calling him to share how a friend mistreated me and he would just hang up then act as if nothing happened. He goes to my sister's room, and tells her with a super sarcastic tone and smile stuff like ""does it feel good not to be accepted in uni? stayng at home doing nothing is what you're best at"" and leaves. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly am at a complete loss what to do. My sister and I have no desire to talk to him, because it's always the same - him being childish, sarcastic towards us or generally not intrested. Plus, he verbally abuses my mom which infuriates me, since she is always so gentle and careful and takes care of everyone. Therapy is not an option, because mom has suggested it and he refused sarcastically saying ""I am not the crazy one in this family"" (sidenote, sister goes to therapy). When I was home half an year ago, we had an ""intervention"" where me and my sister tried to calmly explain to him that what he is doing is not ok and he is abusing alchohol, making a fool of himself in front of his friends. He said he is grateful for our input and would think over what we said. For couple of months there was some difference but that's about it. He regressed pretty fast. I know mom has tried talking to him multiple times but he just doesn't budge. So, please reddit, please give me some advice how to tackle the situation from a distance and what to say.

She never reciprocated cause the timing was off and someone else was already in the picture. I liked being her friend so i pushed through the pain. 

Recently they broke up and she still wants to be friends so they can try later or just to be friends. He doesn’t want to be friends, he wants to cut contact. She told me once and said how she should probably break up with him. So it makes no sense how she would wanna stay friends when it just makes it harder to move on. 

We had been flirting with each other (arm grabbing, standing extremely close, long periods of eye contact, provocative pictures) and she would say it was nothing. I confronted her knowing she was confused and asked if she wanted to take it slow. She replied with that she wasn’t single and that she doesn’t want to lose him. She’s not a player, she just has attachment issues. He isn’t good for her since he was or still is, going down a path of drug use. 

I know she wants to move on and i can understand that it’s hard for her, at such a young age to lose a partner and friend. But it’s upsetting me cause she would give me so much attention while with him and then tell me she wants to end it with him. And when she finally breaks up with him she wants to stay friends. If she wants to start something, i don’t want them to be friends.

I’m torn between just telling her what i want and telling her that we should stop talking. I love her but she is getting on my nerves with this. I’ve been getting agitated lately with this and i want to cut contact but i don’t.

**Backstory**: We matched on tinder, spoke for a few weeks. Met back in February and ever since it was great. We became official I think 2 weeks into dating, maybe 3 weeks. I dont really remember.

&amp;#x200B;

Things were going great, we saw each other every other day and texted often. We would make up our own games and ask questions. We even did that questionnaire that New York Times came out with 36 questions to ask your partner, etc.

Last week and half he left back home (6 horus away) for spring break to visit family. He was doubting to go but I encouraged him to go cause it's good to see your family and it's temporary. He went and all good, we missed each other etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

# So now..

He was suppose to come back on Sunday but instead he met up with me and my older brother half way and off we went to meet up with family friends of mine to a party - stay there for the night and then come back home Sunday. At the party/club we both got drunk it was fun and at some point I said something about how selfish that would be of me to do or something and he said, ""Oh that's okay. Because I think I'm in love with you"". I remember looking at him like wait whaaat.

&amp;#x200B;

He said I'd forget but I brought it up throughout the night to not forget and it was strange feeling to hear him say that. Next morning we wake up, he gets me water and super sweet like always and we both snuggle in bed. He brought it up and asked me to look at my notes. He wrote a note in my phone - by the way this is total fine with me. I usually just give him my phone to put music or look up whatever. I dont have a passcode on my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to my notes and read this letter he wrote earlier that morning. I dont want to put the letter up cause he might follow this subreddit. It went something like this.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey beautiful, I've been thinking about last night. I said I 'might' be in love with you. There's no maybe about it. I am head over heels in love with you. I love the way you smile, laugh, etc."" the letter goes on about what he loves about me and near the end he says how nervous he is just writing the letter wondering whether I feel the same or not. He mentions how he knows we've only been dating for a month or so but genuinely feels like I've known him for all his life.

&amp;#x200B;

then he wrote this (this is copied) ""I don't expect you to feel the same way. I don't need you to love me back yet, Ive just been tearing myself apart inside trying not to let my feelings for you slip out. So if you love me back, fantastic, that's great news and I can't wait to see where we go from here. But if not, thats okay, and I understand, but I want you to know that these feeling aren't going anywhere as long as we're together. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Now I was quiet and not sure how to respond or feel about it. I told him I need time and he says he understands that was it. Last night called my 2 closest friends and one of them says he has the opposite of commitment issues and the other one thinks this is the cutest thing on earth and it seems like I handled it well.

&amp;#x200B;

WELL now I'm feeling the freaking out that I wasn't before. I'm seeing him tonight and I have no idea what to do about this cause I was all chill then. Friend 1 says to tell him not to mention the I love you or treat me that way until I feel the same way to him. Friend 2 says that I handled it well and just continue like normal.

6 weeks ago I met this guy at a local gaming cafe. He seemed quiet but was very pleasant and charming. Physically I found him very attractive. We got along well on the night so I asked for contact details and it went from there.

I thought the next step was to ask him out. He agreed, and we had quite an amazing date. I made it clear I was attracted to him, and since then we've been seeing each other a couple of times a week.

That was until yesterday when we met up. We had another cute time together, but physically he was acting very aloof with me. Eventually I spoke to him, and he started getting emotional infront of me. I wasn't sure what was wrong but he had mentioned some personal issues a week before to me so I thought it might be that.

He ended up telling me that he doesn't feel like he should see me anymore. And his reason was that he feels physically inferior to me when we're together and that he feels ugly in general.

Now, I don't want to paint the wrong picture here by claiming he's a 10/10 when in reality he's ugly or something. But the truth is that he's cute. Subjectively I find him super hot, and objectively he's above average. He has piercing eyes, a great beard, good bone structure and he's in decent shape. I've even complimented him on these things, but based on what he said and how he said it last night, he genuinely despises his appearance. Before I left yesterday he said he just needs some alone time and that he'll talk to me when he feels like he's more balanced mentally, but so far today I've heard nothing from him.

Is there anything I can do? I do like this guy a lot, but I understand that this is a massive issue. Has anybody else had experience with a partner that thought lowly of their appearance? Can anybody provide some advice? Thank you.

t2_9mfon,1553633995.0,b5v7h2,t3_b5v7h2,11,"Me and E has been friends since we were 16 yo and met at the church youth group. We spent quite a lot of time together as part of a larger group until we were 19 when I moved abroad to study. We started to hang out when I was home for holidays and he came to visit twice. Once I moved back home, he moved north for his studies and I went to visit a few times a year. At this time (24ish yo) he asked me straight out if he ever us as something more than just friends. I appreciated his honesty and I replied that I had considered it, but couldn't see us getting along in the long run; our planes for what we wanted to do with our lives, where we wanted to love, didn't match at this point. We continued to hang out regularly and on occasion I got some weird comment/feeling of him insinuating that he wanted more, but brushed it off as me thinking too much of myself.

A few weeks ago I did a tinder profile with a very un-polished descriptions and photos of me (being open about my anxiety, photos of me hanging out on a horse farm, absolutely no make-up). I was swiping through tinder one evening and his profile shows up, indicating that he super-liked my profile. At first I thought it was just a friendly, oh-I-know-this-girl kind of like and swiped to the right. Later that night I started to examine our relationship for the past few months or so, and came to a few conclusions.
*He is one of the two people in my life to whom i can tell everything
*He is one of the two people in my life I can see myself moving together with, and having an everyday life with
*I have never really explored any feelings past good friends that I have for him, since we discussed a possible relationship 2 years ago

He wrote some really sweet things on the tinder chat while we continued our normal chat on messenger, and I kind of got the feeling that he wanted our relationship to evolve, but never wrote anything straight out for a few days. 

I figured that maybe he didn't dare to ""ask me out"" so I thought that I could take the step. Tonight I wrote quite a long message to him on tinder, explaining how I would like to explore our relationship further and that I hoped that he would feel the same, but that I would be more than OK if he didn't feel the same way and we could just pretend this never happened and just continue to hang out as friends.

I am starting to freak out. He hasn't replied yet, and though I feel that I would be happy to continue being just friends, I think that I have already started to fall for him. And just assuming that he has similar feelings for me, how the hell do you get away from being friends for 10 years and go into a romantic relationship? I am really introverted, socially clumsy, and not use to speaking about my feelings.

I'm guessing I'm writing all of this here to see if there's anyone here who has gone from long time friends to something else, how do you get out of a 10 year deep friend-zone?

She ignores me, she lies to me, and she uses me as an emotional and financial crutch. I feel like I get nothing out of the relationship. She feels distant always more obsessed with her phone than in talking to me (And most people) anytime I try to converse with her even about important things like finances she will just straight ignore me or will make up something to try to end the conversation. She lies about little basic stuff that she shouldn't lie about and then when I catch her she just does not care, wont even apologize its got to the point where I don't believe almost anything coming out of her mouth. She complains about everything and doesn't seem to take joy in anything, everything is awful everything is against her. She is unmotivated, she just sit around or lays in bed if she isn't at work she will stay up till 1 or 2 am on her phone and then complain that she is always tired. There is no attempt to be physical with me even down to a hug.

Most people would say I should just break it off, but I think the biggest problem is she has no where to go. She moved 900 miles away from her birthplace and even if she went back there she wouldn't have much as her mother has past and her stepfather is abusive. If I leave she will be stuck with nothing and a poor paying job, but at this point all my confidence and and self love has been destroyed where I have become always sad myself and always afraid of her emotional state. I just don't know what to do. So I just need advice. What should I do?

t2_3hhgs6gv,1553654933.0,b5z2h3,t3_b5z2h3,3,"I have been talking to a woman for a little over a month now. Let's call her H for short. H and I met on bumble and live about an hour away from each other. Until this weekend, our schedules have never really matched up for us to see each other in person. Though we talk every day, all day through texting. Nights where she doesn't work her second job, we facetime while laying in bed until one of us falls asleep.
 
 We have had the talk about being official, and to get past the ""talking"" stage. Yet, we both agree though that we should see each other in person before we do that. A couple of weeks ago, she told me that she had hooked up with a guy from Tinder. Ok, I told her that it's not a big deal and that we aren't exclusive so I am not mad. She replied that she still felt really bad about it and guilty because we have something great going and she doesn't want to risk the chance of ruining it. I told her that I am not going to control her, but if she wants to stop seeing people and wait for me then she can. (I have not been seeing anyone since we have been talking) H said she was going to stop and wait for me. Then last night she tells me she needs to tell me something and I cannot be mad about it. I told her I wouldn't be. She then told me that on Sunday, she met up with a guy from Tinder to hang out. She said she did not plan for anything to happen but she ended up giving this guy a BJ. (Still boggles my mind because why would you meet up with a person from Tinder just to hang out and not mean for anything to happen?) I told her that I still am not mad, a little sad and confused because she said she was going to wait until for us to hang out. She basically explained that I need to tell her that she can't see anyone else because she can't control herself. (What?) At this point, I basically stopped replying because I was in a sour mood and went to sleep.  

This morning, after sleeping on it and thinking, I realized that it is kind of shitty, but once again. We are talking, not official, and not technically sleeping with each other either. I told her how I felt about the situation. She replied that she has to tell me something and it is really hard to say. I'm thinking that maybe it was she was talking with someone else and decided that she wanted to be with them. Last week she had her yearly gynecologist appointment. H tells me that they called this morning and told her that she has gonorrhea. I then asked if she has not been wearing protection during her hookups (She's not on birth control either.) and she told me not with two guys. One was the guy a couple of weeks ago and the other was last year, her ex. My mind at this point is trying to process everything. I know that since we are seeing each other this weekend, nothing sexual was going to happen. Which I am ok with. After talking more about it, I basically told her that it is shitty but these things happen. I try to explain to her why she needs to wear a condom every time with anyone because she's not on birth control. She then replies ""Thanks, dad."" I tried to switch the subject because that one irritated me a little bit. I asked if she was going to talk to the people because she should figure out who gave it to her or let them know in case they don't know they have it. She told me that she has her ex blocked on everything and hasn't talked to the other guy since the night it happened. A couple of hours of more talking and nothing really major happens. She told me that she is so thankful for everything because I care about her health and well being. Later on, she tells me that she is freaking out, I ask why. She tells me that that guy texted her and asked her to chill but she said no. I tell her that it is odd timing that today he messages her. She promises me that she hasn't been talking to him since, and its a coincidence. 

I have been trying to be super supportive of everything and not to judge her. I think we both care for each other, but I feel like she is lying about something to hide it when she shouldn't because there is no reason too. Am I being naive?

I've only told one person IRL, and that's my identical twin who lives across state and had her swear to secrecy.

We've been good friends for over four years with enough shared interests and overlapping friends (including my other roommate, 25f) that I was already practically the third roommate for a while. I only moved in with the other two this past summer and we have plans to move into a different place this coming summer. (Ah, university town.) Slowly though more and more of the roommate's personality has just been grating on me. It's only really gotten bad in the last month. It's nothing objectively wrong per se, it's just the way she exists and moves through the world. She's loud and has no volume control, and doesn't seem to have any social sense. She points out the obvious and always over-explains it to death. She reads too-long posts out loud even when they're completely not suited for a verbal punchline. And the worst part is her laugh. It's always a LOUD cackle. I'm in my room with headphones right now and she's in the other room, and every so often I hear one leak through my music and almost flinch. 

And I HATE that I can't stand it, I know she's creative and kind and accepting and joyful and tries to always do right by people. If I told her that I find her laugh obnoxious she'd be really hurt, and I know I'm in the wrong by judging it. She can't help her laugh. I realize that this problem is with me.

I've been busy working on a big project due soon so that gives me an excuse to be out of the house more, and I often spend a lot of time in my room anyway. It's only been real bad a couple times, and I played it off by being really overstimulated to sound/in need of some quiet and then leaving to help out with a project at another friend's house. Along with being closer to work, the prospect of living with her another year is one of the reasons I'm thinking of a move to the next city over, even though I'd be further away from my GF (21F). 

Nobody but my twin knows I'm feeling this way. It would be a big blow not just to the roommate in question, but to our whole friend group that is practically family at this point. None of my attempts to get myself to appreciate her are helping so far. Does anyone have any advice? I don't want to just sit and simmer until I explode, but the thought of making her ashamed of being herself is even worse.

Now I have met this girl and I really like her, because we have so much in common, love same stuff, but her behaviour is a bit confusing to me. We have been out on like 3-4 coffees and I have given her clear hints that I like her even at one point I told her and she knows it. She'll send me good morning messages followed with some sweet nickname and she'll often through out the day say that I'm handsome, sweet and/or smart. She even said that she likes talking to me as she doesn't have to worry about what she says, that she can rest her brain without thinking much about what topic we gonna talk about. Once she went out on a coffee with a mutual guy friend of ours and I joked with her, saying something like ""Uuu going on a date without me? :smiley\_face:"" and her response to that was ""Dates are only with U, this is a friendly coffee"", the dude is in a relationship for about 2 years, that's why I made a joke. 

We'll be chatting like every day even about some deep topics that are really emotional, her mother doesn't like her because she cut off ties with her ex. She says ""No one will be as my ex"". Now the thing is, she'll drop something like that easily, she'll talk about past relationships, she'll even call me on video call and start crying because guys are DMing her saying that they wanna have sex with her or they are dropping hints to that. Now I'm confused because, why would she mention that to me? I have been always of the mindset, if you want someone then focus only on them, don't care what someone else says to you, especially DMs like that, easy block and bye, and in terms of exes, what happened happened, it's in the past, if they were supposed to be with you still, they would've. I'm guessing she still isn't over her ex and is maybe trying to make me jelaous with mentioning about DMs.

Now I'm wondering am I the rebound (because of the thing with the ex),  friendzoned or do I have a chance? Should I go for it (as I like her because she's beautiful and smart and we have much in common) or just move on?

So my mother recently got diagnosed with cancer, in turn I've been trying to help her eat healthier and start exercising so she could have a better chance of beating it. She doesn't listen at all, still going about her old ways. After spending more time with her throughout the weeks she finally admits she doesn't care if she dies tomorrow because she's not enjoying her life now anyways with my father. My dad was never physically abusive but he had his problems as we were growing up, couldn't control his anger and threw quite the amount of temper tantrums, sometimes breaking things and just yelling and making everyone's life inside the house pretty miserable. You could say he was under a significant amount of stress from work and whatnot. My family is also Arabic and it is custom for the wife to do all the house chores while the husband provides money and shelter. So she's constantly making him his meals, cleaning after him,  laundry/etc after she comes home from work. He's calmed down now but he still smokes inside the house and has my mom on a leash basically.

To be honest I can see why she said that but nonetheless it is extremely distressing to hear my sick mother say that. She is also smiling and laughing most of the time, although now I don't think she was ever really happy at all. I'm trying to get her to exercise but she is REALLY resisting, doesn't want to do it at all(I'm not even trying to get her to lift weights, just go for a walk an hour a day in a hilly area which I would also be accompanying her). She meets this with extreme resistance, also saying it is too cold outside when it would be a sunny 6 degree C day(this is warm in Canada). I'm still in university so I don't have any money to buy her a new place, I don't know what to do. I want my mom to be happy and most importantly I want her to at least TRY to beat this cancer. Is there anything I can do?

They've separated a couple of times before and we were happy for a little bit but she is terrible with money and quickly went under so she moved back in(against all my might to not move back in). At the end of the day, my dad isn't inherently a bad guy, this is just what he was taught growing up in rural Iraq.

We're both in uni and he also has a job while studying an extensive major, which makes him a very busy guy. He still makes time for me and talks to me every night (unless he falls asleep when he's *really* tired), we have regular date nights and he always lets me know what his schedule looks like and if we need to cancel or postpone plans for studies. To summarize, he's a great boyfriend!

So here's the issue: I'm the ""baby"" of my family, and in past relationships I would be spoiled with attention pretty much all day everyday, so I'm used to getting a lot, if not all, of the attention from others. I never actively seeked attention, I was just spoiled with it. I know that this amount of attention can be unhealthy for relationships, and I definitely don't expect it. But it has affected how I view relationships in the sense that if I go to long without attention, I either get upset or get the urge to act out to get it. I don't act out because I know better than that, So I usually occupy myself with hobbies when I have too much free time to overthink about it. But even when I'm focused on something else, I'm still stewing about how I'm not getting enough attention. Even though I know that my bf is just at work or school and is too busy to talk about unimportant things.

I know that needing so much attention is unhealthy for relationships, so I was hoping to get some advice on how I could get used to not getting constant attention? I'm not specifically looking for advice on my relationship because its fine, but I posted this to this thread because I know that it could affect my relationship.

So he knew I had an issue with her.
He told me these “people” invited him to dinner. I had to press and ask questions for him to admit it was her that asked him. 
Another time, I had to ask him specifically who was in his group project group for him to tell me she was in his year long group. If I had never asked him I don’t think he would have ever told me.
Amongst other incidences like this, I saw text messages of him telling said girl he was on his way to the bar to go meet her and was picking up their food. 
I was absolutely hurt because he took this girl out behind my back knowing how I felt. When I asked him why, he said she approached him and he felt bad that he was ignoring her and didn’t want to lose a friend. I get it but he still couldn’t just tell me and he did it behind my back.
I feel like he tends to just hide the truth or twist it to do what he wants (even if he has innocent intentions) because he doesn’t want me to be upset. How can I trust someone like this? Is this something he can fix or is he just a compulsive liar?

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I have had a crush on my barista for a year now. I would go and get coffee and at first it was nothing. He would just take my order and do the basic ""how are you today"" and I would ask the same. It was all very rehearsed. However, sometime in November he introduced himself to me and asked for my name. Ever since then, we are on a friendly basis. We sometimes talk about school (if time allows, the drive thru line eventually gets busy \*sigh\*) and he jokes around sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I just feel like there is a spark between us, as cliche as that sounds. I get really nervous around him. He even remembers things that I've told him from past interactions. For example, I told him one week (I only go to get coffee once a week) that I was baking (I wasn't I just panicked and said I was because of my nerves) and two weeks later when I saw him again, he asked how baking went. He also said I should make him some cookies. Do I make him the cookies? How do I progress this into an outside friendship or, even better, a date? Is he into me or am I simply delusional?

I broke up with him for several reasons last night.  We had a discussion about it then and this morning I called off work to visit my parents for moral support and to talk about my financial plans and he went to work.

I stayed out later with friends to try and keep my mind off things and when I got home he had laid flowers out and wrote a note detailing how he would change and how he'd do anything to be with me, etc.  (Not trying to sound insensitive, just trying to get the facts laid out)

t2_f46dv,1553639068.0,b5w8g8,t3_b5w8g8,6,"Got a call from my friend Bob [24m] just now, telling me he just talked to our friend Maria [23f]. He had reached out to her after helping her boyfriend Andrew [26m] move out of their place this past weekend. 

Andrew is this musician in our community, well known narcissist/manipulator. He’s a great musician which is why we all play with him, but outside of the music, drama always follows him around. He treats his best friends horribly, and takes advantage of other people in our community (me included) by trying to bum cigarettes/weed, food, rides, and places to stay. He’s the type of guy who will smoke all your weed, guilt you into buying food for him, borrow money and never pay it back. He’s also been homeless on and off for the past few years. He dresses and acts like someone from the 70s so when you first meet him in a musical setting, you fall for the charm of how “cool” he is, and how well he plays. 

He moved in with Maria after they found an affordable apartment. They had been dating for a while, but it was more the opportunity of a affordable place than their relationship that made that decision. 

So this past weekend Bob helped Andrew move out of that place. He mentioned that Andrew told him he almost got arrested, but was pretty vague and it. Which got Bob thinking, wait where’s Maria? He sent her a message but didn’t hear from her until today. Why? Because she had been in **jail** covering for Andrew, since he has a warrant for some past drug charge. 

Bob told me Maria had bruises all over her body, and remembered Andrew had a bite mark on his chest. Apparently Andrew has been abusing Maria this whole time. They had a fight this past weekend and the cops were called, so apparently Maria covered for Andrew but was able to get the domestic dispute charges dropped because of the bruises. I doubt she will press charges against him though if she’s trying to cover for him. 
Bob had also mentioned a few weeks ago that someone that Andrew went to high school with had a bunch of stories of girls Andrew dated and abused back then.

Andrew is apart of our community, finding all this out makes me want to tell everyone and get this asshole shunned. But I also just joined this community a few years ago, so I wonder who else knows about this but hasn’t done anything, since some people have known him since High School. 

What do I do? I haven’t spoken with Maria yet but from what Bob said she wants to protect him because she feels her musical career relies on him and his access to other musicians, some of them I am aware are also abusers..but because of their talent it is overlooked. Also the musician community is predominantly male of course which is probably why these guys aren’t being shunned. 

I can’t stand the idea of this guy being around our community and not seeing any consequences to his actions. In the era of #metoo I feel like I can’t just keep quiet about it, cause fuck that shit. 

What can I do reddit? Should I put this dude on blast or are there wiser ways to go about this?

How do I express to my partner how his financial and health decisions are making me physically and mentally unattracted to him? Is there a nice way to say this? Is there any ways I can encourage him to change his habits?

My boyfriend is obese and lives a very unhealthy and costly lifestyle (spends all his income on takeaway mostly). I go gym regularly and I'm quite organised financially and like to travel. He has been saying he will soon go gym for months. We have known each other for just under 2 years, but started dating just before Christmas.

I have a high sex drive and so does he. But I'm not as interested in sex lately since I don't find his growing mumber of rolls attractive. He's the only person who i click with on several levels but his poor health/decisions is beginning to effect my physical and mental attraction to him. 

I find it unattractive to be lazy and disorganised regarding finances and not care for your health. I hope this doesn't offend anyone these are just my preferences . I also value relationships when they make those involved better persons, he has really helped me socially to express myself and make friends as I'm an aspe, he is also encouraging regarding my studies (I'm a student). I think he's made me a better person and happier I'd like to do the same for him.

 Also its not just about me I'm concerned for him. His habits are extremely unhealthy and he's always having digestion problems, diorrhea and his farts smell like something that died. He's also always tired as well as broke due to bad financial decisions.

I want him to be happier, less tired with less digestion problems and have more money to spend on other things he enjoys; travelling, cinema, nights  out with friends etc. He wants to move out from sharing a room with his brother - he lives with his parents, other siblings and nieces/nephews its very cramped and he gets little privacy and it makes him unhappy.

 Rn he can't afford to move but wants to, but even if his salary improved and he could; he'd be homeless and starving within the first month since he spends over a grand on takeaway alone a month (his salary at the moment is around grand and a half per month). I want him to be happy and able to move, travel, do things etc but he can't with how he spends it's completely out of control.

Starting with middle school, she lied to father saying I chose her (my mother) over him to live with when they got a divorce. She packed up all her things and mine in one night. When my dad got home, he didn’t even know I was going to live with my mom and after that experience we didn’t talk too much. 

High school: My mom received a ton of money from child support/grandma passing. I begged her for new cleats for soccer and she would never buy me anything. I couldn’t even get a nice prom dress my senior year but when I walked into her closet she had new purses from coach, new clothes from Kohl’s/JCPenney.  When applying to colleges she basically told me strive for the bare minimum. I wanted to go to FSU (Florida State) and she said it cost too much(because we lived in Georgia)/I wouldn’t get in. At this time period, she has taken the teachers exam probably 26 times to become a teacher and has failed. She’s substituting instead. 

College years: I got into FSU. I took out loans to pay for my entire education. I didn’t receive any money from her. The program was extremely hard because I never been challenged before but I loved it. I ended up failing a class my first year and my mom told me leave the school because it was too hard for me. She said I should pick an easier job/focus. I continued to stay at FSU despite this and she continued to re take the teacher certification. Finally she passed one part of the exam but still failed the other half. I’m applying to graduate schools but she told me I shouldn’t because I could barely handle undergrad and it cost too much money. We don’t talk much at this point in time. 

Gradation: I am able to inherit some money my grandma left for me in her will that was sitting in a bank account. When I finally have access to the account I see my mom has spend almost 20,000 on clothes, purses, and fixing her new house she just purchased. She also paid for my birthday/graduation gifts with this money. I found out my mother asked my dad for hotel money for my graduation day but she charged the bill to the account a inherited...

Now: I graduated from FSU. Now I’m getting my masters at a university in DC. Fully paid for with graduate stipend included. 
She calls me up saying she’s forgetting things and apparently has already had a stroke according to her brain scans. Then tells me all about how she brags about me to her neighbors about how educated I am. (A bandwagon in my opinion) Now she needs someone to help take care of her. We aren’t a rich family and I’m the only child. My mom doesn’t have brothers or sisters and her family beyond that isn’t around. My dad wants nothing to do with it.

t2_3hhp852l,1553617105.0,b5rpep,t3_b5rpep,13,"Hi, r/relationships. I am a 22F and my fiancé is a 27M. We have been together for 2 and a half years, engaged for almost 8 months now. To cut to the chase, my fiancé and I got engaged this past August a few weeks before he deployed overseas with the military. That is where the problems started. I am admittedly not great with long distance communication but I did my best, for him. We were in different time zones and his free time was when I was at work, so I would make an effort to text him on all of my breaks/lunch (was working in food service) as well as let him know when I would be off so we could FaceTime when I got home (I would say we video chatted at least 3 times a week?). But there would be days when I would not respond to a text for a few hours or I would want to work out after work or hang out with friends and it would upset him and he would say that he feels disconnected and like things are “different” and that he was struggling to trust me.  
  
I thought it would get better and go back to normal when he came home and we moved in together, but honestly it’s just gotten worse. He tells me constantly that he feels that I don’t want to be with him and that I am not supporting him and that he thinks I am hiding something. He is especially concerned about my phone, he says that I “hide it” (??) and it is a big theme in arguments. He doesn’t drive right now so I drive him to and from work and anywhere else he needs to go. I frequently arrive to pick him up early and I will sit in the car and browse reddit or fb or whatever while I am waiting for him, and then close my phone and say hi to him when he gets in the car. He finds this suspicious. I have told him it is because it would be rude to just keep looking at my phone when he is right there so I put it away to give him my full attention. He pretty much said ok but keeps bringing it up, and actually the thing that prompted this post was a text he sent earlier that mainly focused on something I did on my phone this morning. I wanted to listen to a different playlist than the one I had on yesterday, so I opened my phone to change the playlist. He said he saw a notification on my phone (can’t confirm or deny, idk if there was one or not) and thinks that I opened my phone to hide said notification.   
  
We have had a lot of conversations both in person and over text and the main theme is that he feels like he “is not being told the whole story” and he is constantly questioning “where [I’m] at” and “if this is what [I] want or where [I] want to be” (direct quotes from this morning’s text). At this point it is starting to get really frustrating and it is also starting to hurt that he can’t trust me and feels as though I don’t want to be here with him. Every time he says those things I tell him that I love him and want to be with him and explain my side of everything that he is suspicious about, but it is starting to get really hard to deal with and is affecting my self worth and self esteem.  
  
He also feels like I am not doing enough for him which like, man, just as a baseline here I get up at 6am every morning to drive him to work and drive home and then go pick him up after work. I get anxiety when driving and I am spending 3-4 hours in the car every day (and spending so much $$$$ on gas) for him. And then of course everything I do on top of that, I give him hand jobs &amp; blowjobs &amp; massages frequently, I drive him anywhere else he needs to go, I bake him muffins and scones every week so he can have them for breakfast, I am constantly complimenting him &amp; telling him I love him. But from his side of the story he feels that I used to “do anything to support him” and no longer do that and that I am acting like I don’t want to be with him. To play devil’s advocate for myself: I have my own mental health struggles and I do have off days where I am quiet and low energy. He feels as though I am not opening up to him enough and he is right, and I am trying to work on that. It is hard for me to open up about the serious things that are on my mind because it has driven people away in the past. It is something I do need to work on. The frequency of these accusations/arguments is also really putting me on edge and making me feel resentful towards him, so I know I have had a shorter temper with him than I used to. Which is also something I should be working on  
  
It has just gotten to the point where I’m not sure what to do anymore. I am not unfaithful to him and I have absolutely nothing to hide. When he brings up stuff pertaining to my phone I remind him that I will happily give it to him to look through if it would help ease his mind but he always refuses. He also has the passcode and his thumb print if he wants to look at it when I leave it lying around too which I have also told him he is welcome to do. Is there anything else I can say or do to reassure him that I love him? Is there any way I can phrase things to really get through to him? I love this man and I understand that he is dealing with anxiety post-deployment and I just want to support him the best I can.

I thought we had some great weekends, especially the most recent one. It takes me a very long time to get comfortable with someone, more than most, but with her I felt different. I felt relaxed and it felt right.

After my drive back home, I get a message from her saying that she’s too stressed out with things and that the timing for our relationship doesn’t work, and that we should put a “hold” on it until we’re both in better places. She claims that she feels the same as I do, but as I stated above, she’s too stressed.

My family isn't the worst; at times they have been great. But they're hugely dysfunctional and as a result I've periodically cut contact with my mom \[50's\], my dad \[60's\] and my older sister \[30's\]. It took a lot of work for me to become a better person and develop emotionally, to outgrow the emotional &amp; physical abuse and lackadaisical parenting I experienced as a kid. Honestly, most of the bullshit stopped when I demonstrated I was willing to cut them out.  

My mom's family is even more dysfunctional (physically and sexually abusive, some drugs), and as a result she cut them out when I was about 7 or 8 and I didn't have extended family after that. No grandparents, aunts or uncles, or cousins. My husband's family isn't perfect either, but they're pretty close, generally reasonable and kind, care about each other, and have large family gatherings for holidays that are wonderful. I don't want my kid to miss out on any of that! 

What makes it hard is that my family lives in the same city as us, but my husband's is several states away and we don't see them very often.

How do you all handle your dysfunctional family members? How do I balance not letting my child get hurt, and not wanting to be hurt myself, with a need for family? How much does dysfunction in extended family really impact children if their parents model healthy behavior? How do y'all resolve family conflicts when someone really disappoints you?

We are good friends and I do love him dearly but I am not sure I can live with the constant battles, the feeling of insecurity I always feel. He always threatens to leave- and now he isnt working and I really need his help, and its just not there.

 I dont feel I have a leg to stand on to tell him to get it together or else because he just says F- U Ill go stay with my mom in another state and he will be gone. 

 Maybe thats not so bad, but when you find someone who you feel so close to, someone who is so comfortable to you it feels wrong to throw it away. Also being that I am almost 40 I just feel like Ill always be alone. 

I wish more than anything in the world that he could chill TF out, find some happiness, some inner peace- that he could go day to day without being so uptight and  bothered by everything. 
When he is in a good mood he is a dream ! 

But he wakes up upset most days. Ill wake up happy and excited for a new day and he is depressed and moody :(.

he has went to psych docs and he has went on a few different forms of medication, but nothing has ever really changed him. I try to promote being mindful, being rational but when he is emotional about something its just more irritating to have me try and rationalize away his feelings. 

He isnt going to go to therapy. I realize that may be the answer for people with personality disorders, but he wont do it. 

I am so torn between continuing to try and cater to him and feel so affected by his emotional whims. I cry often. I am sad inside when I think about him more often than I am happy.  Or cutting it off and letting him go and facing life alone. 

I have friends, I have a teenage daughter, I have a job, I have plans for the future. I am not lost without him, but I will be heartbroken.

He lived an hour away. I tried so hard growing up to have a relationship with him. Called him quite a bit. Always wanted to see him. He never seemed to have much time for me.

 As I have gotten older I just have grown to care less and less. We get along fine. He’s even getting married again which to be honest I’m not thrilled about as his future wife doesn’t do anything. (No car no job). Is it normal to feel this way. Trying to have a relationship now just feels like a chore. I don’t even feel like calling him. It didn’t get me anywhere before so why do it now?

 Am I a bad person for feeling this way? Are my feelings valid? I’m very family orrriented and I hate feeling this way but I can’t help it

I’m heartbroken, but I feel so bad for my dad. I’ve always been his little princess, but my three other siblings (all over 18) have literally hated dad for the past x years. The main reason for this, has been my mom. She is really manipulative and means towards dad, although they’ve been together for over 27 yrs. Everytime dad has done something that mom doesn’t like, she would really make sure the whole family would be against dad. No wonder my siblings are all messed up in their head mentally... But yeah, during this year abroad (have not seen parents in a year) I really thought things had been going to a better direction... Parents have posted so many loving pictures online etc. and travelled together.

I don’t know what to do/say/think about this. I want to be so angry at my dad for tearing the family apart and making me scared of relationships. But at the same time, I want to be so angry at my mom for embarrassing dad again in front of everyone and making the whole damn family hate him even more.

t2_zramm,1553650476.0,b5yboo,t3_b5yboo,8,"So it all stared when we met about 9 months ago, while she still lived with her ex. They were together for 6 years, and about 3 months prior to me meeting her, he dumped her out of the blue. This was a shock to her, and she tried to get back together with him for a long time. She still deep down wants to go back to what they were (Facebook pictures up for both of them, communicating here and there, even though he doesn’t respond much).

Anyway, initially it was just sex for us. I was her distraction, and she was my toy. As all FWB go, I ended up getting feelings for her, and kept pestering for a relationship. She kept saying she did not want one, and won’t be ready for a long time. I met all her family and friends, and she’s met all my friends. We used to all go out together very often. Although we became sexually exclusive, she was “okay” with me going on dates with others, as long as I was honest about it.

I finally started going on dates, and she would get really jealous, constantly accusing me or questioning me. We got into many fights. It was clear she was starting to develop feelings too, but still didn’t want to commit. 

About a month ago, we got into one big fight and both ended up going no contact. 5 weeks later, she asks to meet up to drop off my stuff, and during this meet, she asked to be FWB, as she is comfortable with me, and doesn’t want to sleep around. She also doesn’t want to be just a booty call, and still wants to go out on dates here and there. A mutual friend told me she admitted to missing me. I think she misses my world and being a part of it. 

While having sex again, she stated, “it took me 5 weeks to realize how attracted I am to you, not just physically.” She still doesn’t want to date (I won’t ever ask her again), and still has feelings for her ex, who barely responds to her. She has a lot of guy friends, and is constantly chased (she’s beautiful). 

I told her I don’t think she should come out with my friends anymore (they all don’t think were right for each other), but she misses them too and wants to come out with us. I do not want to get so attached to her again, but the sex is phenomenal and helps keep me not desperate when interacting with girls. Deep down I do want to be with her, but I know that it may never happen. 

Tl;dr, we were basically a couple, ended things due to not being an official couple and getting into fights. Now she’s back, wants to be FWB, but I can tell she wants to go back to what it was. I don’t want to get unhealthy attachment feelings again, but genuinely want to be with her.

He's lectured his own parents on budgeting and frugality, when he's an overspender. He's lectured an illustrator friend of mine on her craft, while he dropped out of art school. He lectures his own friends about eating healthily, when he tells me it's ok for him to eat cake for every meal because this cake is actually bread (long story :P ).



Anyway, it's just a bit of projection coming out of him. I do the same! When I struggle with work deadlines, I will talk about productivity apps, day routines and internet blockers. The difference? I bring it up in conversation, while he hooks onto a comment someone makes, assumes ultimate authority and starts telling folks what they should do. And just keeps going. I'm sure my annoyance seeps through that description, haha.

  
At this point, I need to accept this flaw of his. It doesn't happen often and it's not a deal breaker. 

Yet every time it happens, I try to intervene and ""rescue"" the person he's talking to who's usually too polite to say anything (or it turns into a fight when the other person pushes back). I should just leave. Go poop or whatever. The other adult is responsible for their own escape.

At the same time, I'm getting really worked up. Ugh, the cringe. It gets me so frustrated!! 

So I need help. First of all, I need to just leave the lecture when it starts. Secondly, I need to stop overreacting and getting so extremely irritated by it. Yes, it's annoying. BUT IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

Are there mental tricks I can use to just execute my intention ""if lecture then walk out and come back later""? Why can I not move my legs when I know it's time to walk out? Bathroom break, grab a drink, get a nose of fresh air. It's so simple! 

And what tips do you have for stopping myself when I'm getting worked up?

All my best friends drifted away through college which is fine but I didn’t really have a best friend anymore and likewise for her. We both had long term relationships but like every relationship there is some fights and arguments. However hers was a lot more extreme. She did not have ANY girl friends what so ever and she lived with her bf. He was such an asshole and cheated on her multiple times ( she had proof) but stayed with him. Not much I could do but be a great friend right? We still hung out all the time I always have her my advice but I never got mad at her for staying with her boyfriend because I find that overstepping. Now on my end my bf has had some screw ups ( no where near as bad as her bf) but we always make up and understand eachother. She ended up breaking up with her bf last year which is great ! But obviously I stayed with mine because I didn’t see our friendship as a “ I break up with my bf u break up with yours” but I think she saw it that way? Now recently she doesn’t really talk to me anymore other than in class and she’s changed drastically. She started going to a lot of raves with people I’ve never heard of or seen but I never said anything? then it started getting weird where she would never come to class and never talk to me. Now I have a full time manager job and she works one day a week and we both go to school. I ended up trying to clear the air yesterday and asked if anything was wrong? All she said was “ no” and was very vague and short. I was like come on I know you better than that I know somethings been on your mind and we tell eachother everhtbing and she basically said  “ well you live far and have a full time job so “ and mind you her other friends that she’s been seeing recently live about 30 miles FURTHER from her than I do? We only live about 20 minutes from eachother . And then she went on to say “ well honestly you being with your bf is a very high school move and I’m not with that sh*t, and it triggers me and reminds me of my old relationship and I don’t want to hear about your relationship” and I was so confused and so hurt because I was always there for her ? I was like ok I understand that but why didn’t you just tell me that?? ( even though I don’t understand at all  I just wanted her to have an actual conversation with me). And she never responded and it’s been over a day. Am I really in the wrong? We use to be so close and best friends and honestly good quality friends are hard to come by as a junior in college at a commuter school so I was so shocked and kind of hurt to hear this?

I (22F) just got out of a 2 year relationship with someone(25M) not that long ago. 
In my state of freedom I’ve been taking the liberty to hook up with people, because why not, it’s a free country.

Anyway, I started talking to this girl (20F) from tinder and we started flirting a bit, she is attracted to women and I’m a bisexual. She told me when we were talking that she was interested in dating this girl in the summer and didn’t want anything serious, so I expressed the same thing, just wanting something casual, and I thought, “cool, were on the same page”.

Fast forward to yesterday she invited me over because she wanted help with an assignment for uni, so I come. Within less than a few minutes of being there she’s on top of me and we’re making out and long story short we hook up.
Afterwards, she starts telling me really personal secrets and stuff, and that’s cool with me. However she then starts cracking jokes when my phone was going off saying “are you cheating on me now?”
I thought, “weird but ok”.
She then tells me that things fell through with the other girl and she had plans to be with her until she met me and talking about kind of relationship stuff, she asks me if I’m a jealous person I say “not at all” and she replies with “damn it, I like to tease my partners. I’m a super jealous person” 🚩 but ok.
She asks me to stay the night but she kept looking at me with this intense look of love in her eyes, and I was a little worried and thought staying the night might make this worse, so I said I had to go.

Today she invited me over again, though I politely declined, and talked about how much she missed me this morning and all that, and I think she’s beginning to catch feelings, despite me having repeated that I didn’t want to be in a relationship given my circumstances.

I believe she may be willfully ignoring it and hoping I’ll change my mind, or maybe I’m just over thinking, but it really does seem like she wants more and I really don’t want to hurt her at all.

She’s a beautiful, strong, smart and witty young lady for sure but this wasn’t what we agreed on in the beginning, and she seems like she’s really eager to get into a relationship, and I don’t really think it matters if it’s me or not either. Like maybe I’m a scape goat because the other girl didn’t work. 

How do I talk this out or fizzle out in the least painful way possible for her? I do care about and respect her as a person. I know it will probably hurt her no matter what if she does have feelings but I can at least try and be gentle.

A guy friend of mine, of about eight months told me that he would like to date. We’ve hung out some, there’s chemistry, and I do very much enjoy him. 


Since we’ve talked about it, recently I feel like... idk, like he’s testing me a bit to see if I’m going to react to things he says, since we have slightly different political opinions (both relatively moderate but still not the same on everything), slightly different income levels (I’m saving more,
since I have more student loans to pay off and he has more disposable income), different social modes (I’m extroverted and love going to crowds, he does activities with friends but prefers to avoid networking or socializing just to socialize.) 

I guess, for me, I expressed uncertainty when he first said he liked me because in the past he talked about how he wanted to date someone who could travel, who had lots of extra time, etc. Then he said I didn’t need to worry about that, so I kind of mentally moved on and was like, cool, I guess he likes me and we’re good. 

But it still feels like he’s kind of... testing the water a lot? I don’t mind terribly, I’m not saying I want to jump into anything right now so if he’s trying to decide that’s okay. But is this kind of thing normal for any relationship? I can’t tell if it’s a sign we’re a bad fit or if he’s just nervous and this is his way of protecting himself from me all of sudden turning around and saying “You know what, yeah your hobbies are too nerdy, even though I too am a massive nerd, and I changed my mind.” 
If the latter is the case, do you have any advice on how I can be calm about it without being overly reassuring or too affectionate, which seems to make him balk as well?

So this is a very hard thing for me to explain but recently my partner and I have been more honest about sexuality, interests, fantasies, and feelings. We have been together for many years and it was never a problem we just both knew we wanted a monogamous relationship and we were not shy about sex we just didn’t ever discuss it. Even though I suspected and it didn’t come as a shock to me he recently came out as bisexual. This did not bother me at all. I always want him to be honest with me so he has been openly talking about men (and also women) he finds attractive and how he would like to have sex with them, how he could definitely see himself “f*cking them”. 


We made some jokes about stuff like that before but now he is saying it all the time about anyone he is attracted to. I cannot understand this feeling at all. I have only ever been sexually attracted to him and no one else. I literally never think about having sex with anyone but him; I need a strong emotional connection before I feel any sexual tension. And he is the only person, I also see myself as bisexual since I never cared about gender just a compatible personality, that I have felt that way about. We used to always say how we were positive we were never going to fall in love with anyone else or want to cheat or break up, and I still feel that way. 


But he has recently been saying things like, “he can’t promise me he won’t want to have a relationship with a man or even another woman and he doesn’t want to lie to me. I physically can’t handle those words now if he says anything like it I have a complete panic attack until I can push it out of my mind. I don’t know if it’s me because I just don’t get how he could say he loves me unconditionally and how I was all he ever wanted or needed and now can’t even say he’ll love me forever or if it’s something about his personality now that he is completely emotionally honest and I am overthinking it. 


I don’t know what to do and I know if I lose him I won’t be able to continue living; I’m a stable and grown adult and I know that I actually can’t live without him. How does anyone deal with knowing that their significant other is fantasizing about someone else?

He has reaffirmed that he loves me too and the attraction he feels is what has been explained to me as “normal physiological response” to finding someone attractive but has no intention of acting on any feelings or experimenting outside of the relationship. We have been together for almost a decade and I know it’s not wasted time sunken into the relationship because I don’t regret our time together and it’s worth fighting for.

Now personally, I *did* see the divorce as a red flag at first, but my concerns there were largely put to bed as he has nothing negative to say about his ex wife and they seem to have a pretty cordial relationship. Granted it's early, but I saw it as a good sign that he has never resorted to blaming her or calling her crazy or anything.

As for the age difference. I mean, it's obvious, but I asked *him* out, and he has never acted exploiting or as if we weren't equals.

He is very kind, and has not given me any sort of hard time when I tell him I need to go home or am not in the mood for sex.

So I see no reason right now to think anything negative about him.

Or we go now and she pays the majority of the costs, in which case I will feel like I'm leeching off of her. It also might reduce my motivation or create some weird dynamic almost like she's my mother.

I don't really know what options there are between those two circumstances. We could create some arrangement where I pay her 50% in the future, but I'm not sure what would happen if for some reason we broke up etc.

Does anyone have any ideas of solutions or strategies about how we might do things? Obviously we have communicated a lot already, and this question basically comes from both of us.

**tl;dr** We want to buy a house 'together' but only one of us can afford it because our incomes are very different.

For one, I’m 99.9% sure he cheated on me (see my last post for more details on that, I don’t want it to seem like I’m making the same posts here). For two, I think I’m being gaslighted (see the comments on my last post), which id never really heard of until reddit told me about it. For three, we haven’t had sex in almost 4 months. For four, I’m pretty sure I’m a lesbian. For five, I am not at all attracted to him. For six, he screams at me almost every day. For seven.... the list goes on. 

So I’ve decided, I need to break up with him. However, whenever I think about breaking up with him, I get a really deep anxiety in my stomach. He’s a good dude. Like. He really is. He’s so funny, and really fun to hang out with. I can’t stop thinking about the good things as soon as I think about it. And I just can’t do it. 

I’ll go so far as to say “I’m done. I’m leaving. I’ll move out next month.” And he’ll say “so you’re breaking up with me?” AND I WILL LITERALLY SAY NO. I’ll say like “No, but it’s obvious that you want me to.” And I absolutely fucking know I need to say yes. And I don’t. I just can’t. 

More importantly, the guilt I feel over how we came to move in together makes me feel horrible. I came out of a 4.5 year long relationship, and was scared to death about where I was going to go. We dated for 2 months and moved into together (CUZ IM FUCKING STUPID). He moved out of an apartment with his dad and into a house with me because I couldn’t afford a place on my own.

Well, now I’d be leaving him with the house. And a lease he will have a hard time affording unless he gets a roommate. I can’t do that to him. I absolutely can’t. I feel so sick about it. But he’s told me previously that if we broke up, he’s not moving out. He expects me to stay as his roommate. 

I just don’t know how to do it. I’ve never broken up with someone in my adult life, especially not someone I live with. I feel like such a terrible person. I’ve never hurt someone before. I don’t know how other people make it look so easy. I have a hard time with decision making in general, and I know that’s making this so much worse for me. I just feel like I can’t just take control of my own life here. 

How do I grow up and take control of my life in this scenario? How do I gain the confidence to act?

She wants to hang out more. Its spring break, so today I had a long 3 hour practice at about 10:30 AM. We ended about 1:30 PM and immediately ate lunch. It gave me a bad stomach ache, so I went to lay down. She then texted me to come over to her house, to which I told her i didn’t feel good.

This was a big surprise to me because it seems like she wanted sex more then I did most of the time, allot of times she would be the one to iniate. There was a point when I had to slow it down because  she would iniate late at night and I would go to work tired. I always felt she was attracted to me and loved me, we even made out a ton on our first date.


She realized she wasn't sexually attracted to anyone when she started hanging out with some girlfriends at her gym. The girlfriends would talk about how some of the guys were really hot and attractive. She doesn't share the same feelings at all. She can appreciate a muscular body but only because of the hard work put in to get it. She doesn't find people hot or isnt turned on by hot attractive people.


She is able to orgasm and has regular sex with me. But she says something is missing and isn't really into it untill I start stimulating her. She says she doesn't know what is out there and wants to start exploring to see if she is attracted to something or has a fantasy. She hasn't ever watched porn or been exposed to much. I'm her second real relationship, and she says she's lived under a rock most her life. She made it clear she still loves me and wants me to be apart of this.


She asked to watch pron with me. It worked and she was aroused by it and we had sex after.


I asked her if she found me sexually attractive and she said she didn't know. She also said she isn't gay/lesbian/bi when I asked.


I am happy she was honest with me about this, and I hope we can work it out and find a solution. I lover her so much, I just hope I can fix things.


I always found our sex life extremely satisfying, so I am deeply hurt that she does not. I have been doing some research andthere is a small chance she could be asexual.

Everything was going good until last month, she came to and told me that she want to know what kind of thoughts I have for her.

I told her that I don't want to talk more about  what's inside my head as it might not be good for our friendship and we stopped our conversation there.

But after two days the same question and she was asking again again, so I told her that i was attracted to her physically and wanted to have relationship.

So I invited her at my place and told her that I can not be friends with her anymore because I have crossed that thin line of friendship and every time I saw her I want to do things to her.

t2_vg6mvx,1553644533.0,b5x97y,t3_b5x97y,4,"Some background. My boyfriend recently started a new job. He has a mix of older and younger coworkers, but the ones he interacts with most are the older women.

&amp;#x200B;

Two in particular have messaged him randomly on social media. One was harmless. The other was inappropriate.

&amp;#x200B;

One messaged him a few nights ago a picture of herself where she was obviously shirtless, but had a blanket pulled up on her chest and said something about her being tired after having to work all day. My boyfriend didn't respond, but we both talked about how strange it was.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a few days, she has been messaging him several times a day. Sometimes it's things about work, sometimes it's things about her kids who are his age, and sometimes its memes that are inappropriate. He responds to the things that have to do with work, but he ignores the other messages. He even comments on how uncomfortable it makes him because she rarely speaks to him at work but will message him all day, even when they are there together.

&amp;#x200B;

I have told him that it makes me feel uncomfortable that he responds after she sent the first topless picture of herself. He agrees, but doesn't know how to approach the situation because he is trying to move up within the company, so he doesn't want to say anything out of line or make her embarrassed or uncomfortable. I have tried to explain to him that he needs to stop this before it goes any further, but he thinks it's mostly innocent, yet annoying, messaging.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I overreacting here? I grew up with technology and social media, and sending a picture like that or constantly messaging someone who rarely responds would never be something I would do. How do you deal with an unwanted social media presence without hurting the people behind them, especially when my boyfriend still has to interact with them at his job?

I had just worked a 15 hour day, and saw this within the first half hour of arriving at home. I had an immediate melt down. He wouldn't stop insisting he did nothing wrong because he had no intentions of meeting these people. That he found it as an entertaining pass time.   

I still can't believe he doesn't see anything wrong with this. I asked him to show me his tinder. He has been using this app since November. Which had me melt down even further.   

I've told him if he doesn't see an issue with this when I clearly do. I cannot continue this relationship with him. I am unhappy.   

For some extra context. We haven't been intimate for over a month. He will use my weight as the reason why he hasn't been as sexually attracted to me. So seeing him on tinder was another blow to my self esteem. Not only am I with a jealous man who would accuse me of being the cheater, he would also put me down because of my weight, in addition to ending sexy times because I've refused to give him anal. So finding him on tinder messaging young and thin women is really fucking with my head.   

Today. Still. He is defending himself. Not giving me clear answers on why he sees the need to use this app. Why he's been on it since November. He won't even tell me if he's either deactivated or deleted the account he has now. Making it clear he has intentions of continuing to use it. I feel so fucking heart broken. I cannot even look at him the same.   

Last night he was laughing at me because I was ""overreacting"" and still isn't taking me seriously when I say I don't want him anymore. I feel so broken down. I hate to say that I do still want him. It's become one of those cliche, my heart wants him but my brain is saying no.   

I feel so lost. How do you people actually stick by your word when you say it's over? It already feels so difficult. I know if I just forgive him. This is just going to happen all over again. But I already feel so burnt out. I just want to give up.   

TLDR; husband sees no issue with using tinder as a pass time. He's saying I'm overreacting as he hasn't done anything with anyone off the app.",relationships,My (25F) husband (30M) says there's nothing wrong with using tinder to pass time.
t2_xjxwdl0,1553811790.0,b6p8xv,t3_b6p8xv,22," 

My wife and I were good friends our whole lives and started to date near the end of high school.

We went to the same college together and all through out college there was never a doubt in my mind i would marry this woman. I proposed our senior year of college and got married a week after graduation.

Then 4 months later her mom killed herself.

I tried to be the most supportive husband i could be. I did what ever i think could have helped to ease the suffering she was going through, I tried going out to eat more, taking more vacations, being available for venting/crying etc... She didn't get sad or depressed, she got angry instead. She started lashing out at me frequently for small things. One time she loudly berating me at a restaurant for ""looking at her like i'm scared of her"".

I suggested several times that her and her sister should go see a therapist. She refused every time. I pushed the issue hard one night and her response troubled me, ""I know exactly what to tell a therapist to trick them into thinking i'm fine, so its useless for me to go."" I didn't bring it up again.

I started to see a therapist about a year later for my worsening anxiety and depression issues. I felt my therapist leading me down the path that this anxiety and depression is stemming from myself not getting what i need in a partner.

I finally broke through and she agreed to see my therapist for some marriage counseling. She was angry after our sessions because our therapist kept suggesting that she wasn't respecting my boundaries and had unrealistic expectations of my role as a husband. My wife kept stating that since I saw the same therapist for my individual sessions the therapist had an unfair bias toward my feelings and emotions because she had a negative view of her before she stepped in the room for the first time.

Things improved a little bit for a few years until recently I've been struggling hard with depression. I'm seeing a therapist every week and i feel as if my therapist is leading me down the same path. Which is, i'm not getting what i need from a relationship and that my depression is a symptom of that.

One thing that i'm very bad is is communicating my emotional wants/needs. I'm a people pleaser and have a hard time saying no and pushing my opinion. My therapist and i decided to work on this by telling my wife i need some encouragement the next time i feel depressed to see if that helps.

So the other night i was feeling sad/depressed so i muscled up the courage to ask my wife for a favor, ""Hey, i'm feeling a bit depressed and need a bit of encouragement.""

She responds with, ""No, i'm not giving it to you because you need to learn to live without it.""

Then she proceeds to go to bed with out saying goodnight.

I want to suggest marriage counseling, but i'm half tempted to not even try. I don't think some one deny's their husband a few kind words is someone who's loved and respected.

I'm not 100% sure how to proceed, I want to give her the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to the tragedy but i'm not sure how much longer i can go on without encouragement and constantly walking on egg shells. It wrecks my world.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: After my wife's moms suicide 6 years ago my wife,still lashes out in anger regularly and refuses to give me any verbal words of affirmation, leaving me depressed.  ",relationships,"I'm[M28] thinking about leaving my wife[F28], The only person I've ever dated."

t2_38tgg6ls,1553822049.0,b6r4b7,t3_b6r4b7,2,"
I began seeing my fwb back in April of last year (next Monday will actually be one year since we've met) and he was in a relationship at that time. When we first met I was not looking for any romantic relationship of any kind and he said that I wasn't the kind of person he'd be romantically interested in. His partner at the time had no issues with our arrangement. We actually followed through on the ""friends"" part of the fwb arrangement. We are very close and when I was abroad for a few months, called, vchatted, and sexted around once a fortnight. There were some issues at first - he is the sweetest person I've ever met but can be a bit boneheaded and he said some things that hurt me deeply, but I expressed my feelings to him and we worked it out. I also wanted to make sure that we kept boundaries, and asked that we not use pet names or terms of endearment. He is naturally a very affectionate person and calls me pet names, and I take responsibility for the fact that, after a few months of knowing each other, I stopped enforcing those boundaries.

His partner and him had some difficulties and ended up breaking up at the beginning of the year. Around that time he began seeing two other partners and would do things such as accidentally compare their sexual performances to mine, and also seemed disinterested in spending time with me. Since we were very good friends I was very upset and made the foolish choice of not speaking to him about it because he was going through the middle of a breakup and an important professional training/milestone and I thought I should handle my feelings on my own so that I do not get in the way of an important part of his life. He was obviously infatuated with one of his new partners and did not initiate meetups as often. He did not seem to care about professional or personal milestones in my life and rather used me as a therapist, having me work through the feelings he had for people he thought of more and wanted to spend more time with. I don't think he did this maliciously but there were times when I would ask for him to initiate meetups more and he would apologize, saying that he was busy and that maybe I should initiate less, so that he would feel my absence and come to me more.

He stopped seeing his partners as often around the middle of February. I didn't actually know this as I had asked not to hear about his sex life, as I felt uncomfortable hearing about sex with other people as I didn't know whether his other partners would be ok with him discussing it with me.

Things kind of came to a head when he missed a very important performance I had invited him to. I was absolutely infuriated as this had been something I had been working on for weeks. I knew that he had been more conscientious with his other partners, especially the one he had romantic interest in, and felt used. I spoke to him about how I felt disrespected and that he had little interest in me besides using me as a comfort blanket and a therapist. He was very upset that I had not communicated this back in January. I understand that this is my mistake but to give some context - he was under a high degree of pressure and stress and honestly I felt that having difficult conversations with him at the time would have been bad for him. He explained that I should have at least asked if he would be willing to have difficult conversations with him during that time. I agree now that that would have been the best course of action. In any case, I would have had that conversation with him anyways, but the circumstances of him missing my event made it a situation in which two months of resentment and pain boiled over. It wasn't good.

Around that time I realized I had feelings for him (haha whoops) and decided to tell him because I figured that we should end our arrangement since he so vehemently declared that I could never be an object of romantic interest. I figured it would be healthier for me to stop seeing him and move on.

Well, it turns out he has feelings for me too. I think. That's what he said at least. We both agreed that we shouldn't date right now while we work this out, and he told me that while he would be on dating apps, he wasn't looking for a relationship at the time while he worked on himself. He is very ashamed of his insensitive tendencies, and honestly, I was incredibly upset at him and told him that he was a bad person to me. There were times in January where I would try to communicate my upset, and he would say things such as (paraphrased) ""Oh it's ok, it's not like I don't have time to see all of my partners so I'll keep seeing you"" (implying that if time was a factor, I would be dropped as a fwb).

We are talking about things and we have had difficult conversations in the past couple of days over the pain I felt about feeling rejected and his guilt over causing me pain. He is going on tinder dates, and told me that he might want to start a relationship with one of them. When I asked him where he viewed me as part of his life, he told me that he didn't feel comfortable dating me right now because he still felt guilty over causing me pain. His previous partner also was often hurt by him and he still is very ashamed of how he made her feel. He says that he knows that there are people out there that are less sensitive and that will not be hurt by his words or actions as easily, and that will communicate with him when they are upset (this point really upset me, since the incident at the beginning of the year was the only time I didn't communicate with him when he was behaving hurtfully for what I thought at the time were justified reasons). He says that while he does have feelings for me, he wants to get into other relationships first and see if he is able to think about dating me a few months down the line.

I don't think I can do that. I do have feelings for him and to see him develop a relationship with another person while I am stuck in a limbo of will he/won't he date me will be unhealthy for me. For this reason, I am thinking of ending this year long arrangement. The thought does not excite me at all. I am literally in tears typing this but I don't fucking know what to do.

I would appreciate any feedback this sub has to give. I have made a lot of mistakes the past two months and I want to be told honestly if the disintegration of this relationship is my fault. Thank you for reading.

Taper is about 1 inch at the top of the thinnest piece to 3 inches at the bottom of the thicker one. Not sure what species it is - I thought alder, because we have lots of them, but the bark is very thin and papery, it's layered and peels easily so I'm guessing some kind of birch.

I'd like to use these pieces to build an indoor cat tree, but the inner layers are still very flaky and peeling, so as is, they'd be messy. However, the natural bark is multicolored and rather beautiful so I'd rather not strip it all off.

The first month without him around was really rough, I cried a lot and had really bad anxiety and depression. I made different accounts to try and reach out to him, but never got a response. I quickly gave up and slowly accepted the fact that he probably wasn't coming back. I tried to meet new people during this time, but it was never the same. Our friendship has pretty much always been rocky like this we argue about something or friction builds and we get angry at each other, but this time is different he had never ghosted me like this before. By the second month I completely gave up hope that I'd ever talk to him again. Now he's just back and want to scrape it under the rug like nothing ever happened and I'm still really hurt by what he did. He told me that I'm irreplaceable and he made a terrible mistake. He's apologized, but after all I pain I experienced before and after I don't know if I should forgive him. Part of me is really happy he's back, but I feel like he's just given up on finding someone else to replace me. He's my best friend, but I really don't feel like I'm his.

Would several clusters of pocket holes at the base of the vertical peices paired with L-Shaped metal corner braces or wood corner braces be a good start?

Recently purchased a house that came with a shed. In the shed were many hand and power tools for woodworking. The owner wanted a flat sum for the lot and I said sure. I have not stepped foot in a wood shop since high school, \~20 years ago. Please, help me identify what some of these are as I have never seen a  few of them, what projects I can handle with them/the space, and what projects do you suggest for easing back into woodworking after two decades away. Thanks in advance.

The wood is Marri from Western Australia.  
First time using a router. I got some tear-out but mostly OK thanks to multiple very shallow passes. The grain direction was all over the place with this wood.   
It was also my first time using splines. The splines are from an offcut of Rosewood veneer.

Overall very happy with how it turned out and it's been put to use pretty regularly over the last few months since I finished it.

1)
Here's a little red oak pot I made to use as a plant pot: https://imgur.com/gallery/wlKPQyP
Hand tools only. Figured out to make a shooting board to get the miters. Is it worth sealing with something if it's going to have dirt in it and be watered or will it last fine as is?

2)
My first dovetail because you all seem to love seeing these and judging. Also done with red oak. Fits snug but pretty rough and plenty of room for improvement. This was more for me to look back on and compare as I progress.

3)
And now for my question. I have this wood from a maple (sugar I believe) that fell a year ago. The base was pretty rotten, but I saved some of the upper branches that seem fine other than a few little beetle holes. They've been seasoning in the garage since then: https://imgur.com/gallery/ve4RSJX If I want to turn that into useable wood for something like this coffee table how do I go about that? https://drive.google.com/open?id=11N3VlfOcifYLymmIedNfy24PmBheQTcJ

I'm currently in the process of making my own wizard/druid staff from a nice branch (small trunk, actually) I found in a local forest. I let it dry for months and now I started working it but I'm running into two problems:

1. The top of the staff (which was the foot of the tree) has some brittle/soft parts to it, circled [here](https://i.imgur.com/7NHMAI4.jpg). I don't mind it looking weathered or rotten, I think it looks rather fitting for a druid staff but I don't want it to deteriorate any further.  Is there a way to stop it from falling apart?

2. The trunk had several small branches sticking out which I had to cut off but now I'm left with [these](https://i.imgur.com/3pgoJ7p.jpg) knothole type things. They are not the end of the world and some of them will get covered (e.g. by a leather grip) but is there a simple way to make them less obvious? I don't think filing/sanding is the way to go as I will probably just destroy the worm hole markings (which I rather like) in the process thanks to my limited woodworking experience and tools...

We hadn't spoken or seen each other in this time and I had been finding myself increasingly more tempted to message her just to catch up. There was no romantic intention, just a desire to find out how she was getting on, what she had been doing etc. We had been together around 18 months before breaking up in a fairly mutual way and while we obviously weren't best pals after I didn't feel there was any bad blood and I didn't get the vibe she felt any either.

&amp;#x200B;

I sent a casual message asking if she fancied catching up with one another but she shut me down immediately! She said she had moved on with her life and has no interest in speaking to me at all. So besides the obvious rejection I'm finding it really hard to understand why she reacted in this way when I feel so intrigued and excited at the prospect of finding out about the last two years of her life. Am I naive to think she'd still be wondering about me as I am with her? Am I missing something?  Would anyone be able to explain or describe her mindset on this?

I have been working on hardwood floors for a few years now, did some finish carpentry work.. but I never considered myself a professional carpenter..

Most of my knowledge comes from the internet information and videos i've seen throughout the years..

I want to become a professional carpenter.. including cabinetmaking and outdoors carpentry projects..

Currently working with a carpenter who builds pergolas and decks..

I tried to work in a cabinetmaking shop, but It would have taken me years to get to the point where i'm using the big table saw, meanwhile i have my own small table saw and can buy a bigger one and practice on my own.. the cabinetmaker didn't even know whats a fesool domino..

I have a bunch of tools including a domino, planer and jointer.. 

Here's a picture of probably the most complex wood related project i've done, took my about 7 hours to install engineered flooring on the stairs.. https://imgur.com/xwVRG2b 

My style of doing things is researching the hell out of something and then practicing it, i can't do the whole ""work for a bunch of people for years and accumulate knowledge and then get out on your own"" the internet just has too much information..

Would love your input and ideas.

hello...I decided that I wanted to get into wood working. I took shop in HS for a couple of years but had a desire to build some things better than a candle box, a small stool, and nunchucks when Mr Welsh wasn't looking. ""They're chair legs, Mr Welsh. Honest... The chain and ball joint is...uh... decoration""   
I am an apartment dweller and I do not have a space for this kind of hobby. Luckily there is a wood shop in SoCal where I can rent bench space and they have all the tools I'd need.   
My first project was a chair mat that I saw on Pintrest. I made a LOT of mistakes but I guess that was the point. I have carpeting at home any I ALWAYS destroy those plastic roll over chair mats so decide I built a wooden one.    


I made some mistakes along the way not limited to:

* used cheap pine moulding that was too small and hung over the side I ultimately replaced it
* cutting the wrong angles in the moulding
* not staining/ the moulding before I put the planks in
* staining at night in my apartments garage where I couldn't see everything great
* Free cutting one of the jig cuts because ""it'll be fine"" and it caught up to me later
* I should have used 1/4 ply instead of 1/2, this thing is HEAVY  


One thing the wood shop I go to does not have is a finishing/staining room. I'm left with doing that in my garage which is less than Ideal. For better projects I was considering erecting a very temporary enclosed space constructed of plastic sheeting and plywood (2x2?) Just something to keep the dust off it while the stain and, more importantly the finish cures.

No matter what I do on all the chisels and the block plane blade, the sharpened surface isn't square.  I'm using UltraSharp diamond stones in conjunction with a water stone to finish it.

Does it even matter if it's slightly off square, they are super sharp?

\-I'm apply even pressure when sharpening, not pushing one side more than the other

\-When tightening the chisel or blade in the jig I'm super careful to tighten evenly

Once I opened the shrink wrap it came in at home, a paper came out stating ""I MUST oil or seal it within 48 hours"". So as I researched most were just videos or tutorials of people showing proper staining techniques. This is going to be used as a home office desk, so no cutting or cooking. But it would be nice if it was resilient against water spills or the occasional coffee cup. Any tips/advice/direction would be greatly appreciated.  

From research I've found that mineral oil as well as several others will soak in and provide nice results, but papers left on the desktop will soak up the oil, and that is a huge concern for computer equipment and paperwork. 
Waterlox was suggested but darkened the color significantly in the test videos. 

Thanks for any help.

Working with limited workspace and my miter station already takes up a good third of that.  Since it'll be bolted to the stand, I was going to put my shopvac under it and run a hose up for dust collection.  My question is this:  Would it be better to cut a hole in the bottom of the stand like right above the shopvac and right under the saw and connect the hose that way so that the dust is going straight down in the hole?  Or would it be better to cut a hole in the plastic side of the table saw base and connect the hose that way?  Or is there an easier way that I'm not thinking of?  Sorry I don't have pictures.

t2_9k2hk,1553262724.0,b45bhv,t3_b45bhv,6,"Back in the fall, I picked up a 10"" 20 year old delta contractor saw on CL. The motor is in OK condition, the top was fairly corroded and stained. Back then I started on it with WD40, penetrating oil, a razor blade scraper, etc etc. and made pretty good progress.

For Christmas, my wife got me the Bench Dog router table extension, so the other day, my son and I removed the existing left extension and of course there was a lot of corrosion there too. We started scraping and got frustrated and went to naval jelly and then a wire wheel attached to my drill. During this, the wheel slipped onto the table top and I saw that there was more corrosion on the top than I had thought.

So I went all in and just used the wheel across the top. I was careful and didn't bear down or stay in any one place for any length of time and found a lot more rust than I thought was left.

Ok so now the top is pretty clean, could be a little smoother but I'm ready to rock so I get the mineral spirits and start wiping down to remove the oils I had used. Hmmm the rag comes away dirty. Let's keep going. Hmm the rag keeps coming away dirty anywhere I was pressing down (a quite good rendition of my hand every time) and the top still isn't clean.

Is this just the normal process? I know cast iron is porous, should I expect this? My shop is set to 65 degrees. If I raise the temp would that help? I know when cooking you get the pan hot to close the pores but I'm not going to get my saw top hot per se.  I can keep going, I just haven't read anyone else write about this phase of the restoring process. I kind of expected to just wipe it down and be all set.

I was thinking of various solutions involving my propane torch but (a) there are volatile oils involved in a wood shop so that seems like a bad idea and (b) I don't want to end up warping my saw top more than it is from its prior years of abuse.

On the other hand, if this is just normal process and I just have to do this earnestly 10 passes or whatever, I can suck it up (or assign it to the boy, RHIP) and get on with it.

Looking forward to the collective wisdom of the hive-mind...",woodworking,"Refinished rusty Delta contractor saw top, now cleaning, infinite black fines"

I've recently built my very first dining table, which I'm very satisfied with. The table top has dried for +24 hours.

However, whenever I wipe a damp cloth across the table top, the stain rubs off heavily. The stain I used is waterbased, and so is the lacquer on top of it. Could this be the reason? And if so, is it possible to apply an oilbased lacquer on top of this to avoid it rubbing off?
If this is not the reason why it rubs off, I would really appreciate if someone could help me find out what the reason is.

I hope there's some experienced woodworkers willing to help! 

Thanks!

Right now I’m between enamel paints, Mixol (which is what my shop uses to tint epoxy), Tintbase, or maybe Ranger alcohol ink. Since Mica powder is safe for makeup, I assume that would be relatively food safe as well but I would like the option of something more translucent so the final epoxy is not opaque. 

I want to sell these if possible and would hate to make someone sick because I didn’t do my research. Also, I always get questions at my shop about dye and tint options for butcher blocks, so it’ll help there as well.

I help with stage crew at my high school and since next year is my senior year I'd like to leave a lasting impression. One of the biggest hassles is our shop. It's incredibly crowded with almost no floor space, hardly any storage, next to no organization, and, in general, is probably a fire hazard (I'm honestly not sure how the fire marshal gave the okay for us to run our last show.) Excluding some brackets, we do nearly everything in wood which is why I came here, since so many of you have had to develop your own wood shops.

The shop is pretty large, it's rectangular shaped. Along one of the long walls is a huge bench with a miter saw at either end. Towards one end there's a cabinet with paint and at the other a cabinet that has labels for different power tools despite them being empty. Next to that is a shelve where all our cords and battery charges live. There's two pretty big workbenches (practically immovable i'm assuming) near the wood pile and the paint cabinets. The wood pile takes up an entire short wall and wraps around the corner and claims another 4th of a long wall. There's then a bin for the true scrap wood (we're talking the real scraps, here). Next to that there's a band-saw and a drill press that I was told I wasn't allowed to use (I'm guessing because there's no real way to 'use' them since there's no floor space around them). Next to that would be a small work surface (permanently cluttered) with some peg board along the wall and some drawers underneath that, despite being labelled, are essentially junk drawers. Most of the floor space in the middle is taken up by props, a desk with all 10 draws full of caster wheels, a broken golf cart, and huge foam/wall panels. Finally there's a table saw that gets pushed around to wherever is most convenient. Not because it's on wheels, but because there's hardly any room so you have to move it in order to work on anything.

Lack of storage is one of the major things taking up floor space. Huge 4'x8'x4'' foam boards, to 4'x8' (pretty common measurement apparently) wood panels for floors and walls. These particularly are taking up a massive portion of the floor space, there's quite a few of each of them so I'm really stumped as for a better way to store them than stacked on the ground.

Next there's all our wood which is sheet and dimensional, most of it is from old dismantled sets so there's so many different sizes. There's shelves with all of our dimensional lumber, cut and new, stacked, with 5 shelves and the top shelf being taller than me (5'9"") it's pretty hard to find the right kind of wood to use. On top of this being that all the weight of the other boards are usually resting on the one you need.

The heavy workbenches, paint cabinets, miter saws (and their workbench), and the worksurface are all realistically stuck where they are. Everything else can probably be moved around. So long as it isn't in the corner with the fire extinguisher riser or the fire door which takes up an entire short wall. My director and teacher is pretty opposed to big change or ""fixing what isn't broken"" so I really need a great plan to approach her with if I want this to ever come to fruition.

Is there a technical name for that shape?

Regardless, I'm wondering if you all have any ideas as to how you'd go about it? Best I can come up with is marking a base, a top (which would have to be smaller area), then hand planing down from a corner at the bottom at an angle to an edge of the top square?

I would really like to construct this with joints that appear as mitres, but making the ply thick enough to provide a strong enough joint would make the box too heavy. I have considered making the box of thinner ply, and doubling it at the outer edges around each opening for about 30-50 mm.

I recently purchased an [98"" IKEA Hammarp] (https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20274961/#/60274964) to use as a desk.  These are all the rage in ""hack"" desks and it'll be perfect for my applications.  I'll be supporting it atop two of their [Alex drawers](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90373038/?query=ALEX&amp;icid=iba|us|unbxdsuggestion|201811132211556208_1) with some [50mm legs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0725HDDYV/ref=twister_B071VKYX3N?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1) to add increased height.


One caveat I keep reading about is the sag that occurs due to the long span between the drawers and the fact the Hammarp is a countertop designed to be used as such.


I would very much like to avoid putting a middle leg in the span.  Based on some reading it seems I could potentially solve the sag problem using angle bars mounted to reinforce the countertop.  [Here's a rough 3D model of what it'd look like](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/b8uSBozlY5I-hammarp-desk)


My questions I hope someone with more experience can answer are,

1.  Is the angle bar solution going to be effective at preventing sag? 
2.  Will the alignment I have shown in the 3d model be sufficient, or do the angle bars need to be anchored to the drawers/legs?
3.  What gauge of angle bars should I be looking at?

Alternatively, 


Is there an easier/better solution using the angle bar or other hardware that I'm missing?

I had just worked a 15 hour day, and saw this within the first half hour of arriving at home. I had an immediate melt down. He wouldn't stop insisting he did nothing wrong because he had no intentions of meeting these people. That he found it as an entertaining pass time.   

I still can't believe he doesn't see anything wrong with this. I asked him to show me his tinder. He has been using this app since November. Which had me melt down even further.   

I've told him if he doesn't see an issue with this when I clearly do. I cannot continue this relationship with him. I am unhappy.   

For some extra context. We haven't been intimate for over a month. He will use my weight as the reason why he hasn't been as sexually attracted to me. So seeing him on tinder was another blow to my self esteem. Not only am I with a jealous man who would accuse me of being the cheater, he would also put me down because of my weight, in addition to ending sexy times because I've refused to give him anal. So finding him on tinder messaging young and thin women is really fucking with my head.   

Today. Still. He is defending himself. Not giving me clear answers on why he sees the need to use this app. Why he's been on it since November. He won't even tell me if he's either deactivated or deleted the account he has now. Making it clear he has intentions of continuing to use it. I feel so fucking heart broken. I cannot even look at him the same.   

Last night he was laughing at me because I was ""overreacting"" and still isn't taking me seriously when I say I don't want him anymore. I feel so broken down. I hate to say that I do still want him. It's become one of those cliche, my heart wants him but my brain is saying no.   

I feel so lost. How do you people actually stick by your word when you say it's over? It already feels so difficult. I know if I just forgive him. This is just going to happen all over again. But I already feel so burnt out. I just want to give up.   

TLDR; husband sees no issue with using tinder as a pass time. He's saying I'm overreacting as he hasn't done anything with anyone off the app.",relationships,My (25F) husband (30M) says there's nothing wrong with using tinder to pass time.
t2_3hwpjjxa,1553785077.0,b6jsvh,t3_b6jsvh,245,"A little background - I'm 32, have 3 kids with my ex-wife (married 7 years). My girlfriend and I have been dating a hair over 3 years.

Legally my ex and I have 50/50 custody, however I have the kids a bit more than she does. She's not the most responsible person, and by her own admission, she isn't the most maternal person either. She enjoys going out and drinking, partying, etc. We have a good relationship, even though it often times feels like she's another child as opposed to the mother of my kids. Regardless, we have a custody agreement that we both agree on. I make about 3x as much as she does so I'm legally obligated to pay her child support even though we officially have 50/50 custody. I'm totally and 100% ok with that. 

Enter my girlfriend. Everything is going good, we have a great relationship, and the kids love her. She's not a huge fan of my ex, simply because of her lack of parenting skills, but keeps it to herself (and me). 

My biggest irritation in the entire world is how, anytime I do anything for my kids, she has to make some snarky comment(s) about my ex.

Got my daughter a phone for her 10th birthday. 
""Is their mom going to help pay for that?""

Get a call from school, leave work to pick up a sick kid. 
""It just pisses me off how much you do for your kids and how little she does for them""

My son calls me when he's at his mom's to get help with his homework. 
""Can his mom not even handle helping him? Is she that dumb?""

I love helping him with his homework - it's one of our things!

She constantly makes snide comments about how I have them more than she does yet I have to pay child support.

I do the things I do for my kids because I'm their dad, it's my job to take care of them. Why does everything I do always have to be compared to what she *doesn't* do for them? What am I gonna do, tell the school ""sorry, their mom needs to take more responsibility so I will not be picking my son up from school"" like wtf? 

I've brought this up before, about how I don't appreciate her turning everything I do for my kids into an attack on their mom, and if she feels the need to comment on it, maybe shift her thinking to a more positive mindset and tell me how cool it is that I do what I do for my kids. It doesn't seem to sink in.


TL;DR 
My girlfriend compares everything I do for my kids to how little their mom does and I don't see why it matters. They're my kids FFS.

How should I approach this and let her know it's starting to chip away at our relationship? Am I overreacting? Do I need to look at things through her point of view? Any and all advice is welcome and greatly appreciated.

Edit 1: I don't necessarily think it's unfair that I have to pay child support. It's not much, and it's meant to supplement the income difference between our households. A part of me thinks it's dumb that I have to pay, but considering I'm a divorced dad in the Midwest I think I have it pretty good. It's 2019 but the courts are still mainly (around here at least) anti-father. In my case my divorce lawyer even warned me that the judge handling our case was notoriously against fathers, for whatever reason. With that, my ex and I came to an agreed upon custody schedule. If we couldn't have done to an agreement, it would've been up to the court to decide, and that could have potentially ended very badly for me. 

Edit 2: Thank you all so much for your advice. I am taking everything into consideration and am trying to come up with an un-objective (that's a word, right?) way to approach the situation in order to have a mature and honest discussion with my GF this weekend.

t2_3akkhafg,1553815140.0,b6pw4l,t3_b6pw4l,52,"So I noticed my cousin was affectionate and flirting with this boy during a neighborhood party last weekend. I don't think there's any good reason for a 14 year old to be flirting with a 20 year old. I don't even think there's a good reason for them to talk to each other like that, so I interfered. I just went there and told my cousin that her mom was looking for her, took her to my aunt and uncle, told them what happened and they asked me to take her home.

I took her some advice, told her that it's not appropriate or safe for her to be talking to boys that are that much older than her. She said she likes talking to boys and I told her that she should just hang out with boys who are her own age, that's fine. She seemed to understand it, I'm sure my uncle and aunt will give her the same advice.

Once I was back to the party, I told my girlfriend what happened. Earlier today, she came to me and accused me of overstepping my bounds and being controlling towards my cousin, saying I'm ""baby""ing her and she should make her own decisions. I don't agree with this mindset, I think I was just looking out for her and it was for her own good. She's 14 and can be stupid (like I was at that age). Girlfriend believes I have no rights to make that judgement.

She has demanded that I apologize to my cousin and promise her that this will not happen again, and I really can't make that promise nor am I going to apologize, because I don't think I did anything wrong and I'd do it again.

When we got out of college, I went to get a master's degree and my brother went into a post Bach program for a medical field, but he moved away from the state we grew up in. Since he has moved away, it's always felt rough to me because even though I get to spend more time with my parents since we are in the same area, they always talk about him when I'm around and it makes me feel less than adequate. To the point where when I see them once a month or so, they always bring up ""we should FaceTime your brother"", even though I don't see them a lot.

So my brother met his now wife in school, then moved to her state once they both finished their medical programs. The wedding was a bit tense, as my Mom didn't really get along great with my brother's wife or her Mom. But after the wedding, they established themselves in his wife's home state and recently bought a house. We all visit them once in a while when we can, but it's not easy because of the distance.

I haven't always had a great relationship with my parents, especially after my brother left. But recently I thought it was okay and I was trying to spend more time with them and help them out when I could, and I was looking forward to spending my birthday with them as it's coming up and I'm turning the big 3-0. I was talking to my brother today, and he told me that they had bought tickets to visit him over our birthday weekend, and it caught me off guard. On the one hand, I want them to be able to see him and spend his birthday with them, but at the same time they didn't say anything to me and it hurts a lot. I haven't spelled out the whole background with my parents here, but I've had multiple conversations with them about how I sometimes feel valued less than my brother because of their actions, and they mostly have responded negativey and told me I'm being too sensitive.

Writing this out I feel like I'm just whining a lot, ""my parents don't love me as much as my twin brother,"" but I really have felt like I have put so much effort into my relationship with my parents and trying to be there for them and help them when they ask for help, where as my brother has always done his own thing and they seem to cater to him. It's been seriously hurting my self esteem, and making me want to step back slightly from my relationship with my parents. I don't think I can talk to them about this, because of how they've responded before. I'm not sure if I'm asking for advice, or more just writing this down to see how it feels when I read this back, but I any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

However ,I've noticed from like around Christmas time that he keeps asking me to buy him things. The first few times he said it i actually thought he was playing because he said it so bold , almost commanding me...in a nice way. Then times after that it would be so weird, because he would say it out of nowhere, like ""oh your in that store... buy me this and that"" ... wth . I'm not a cheap person but I am a bit selfish, and frankly I don't appreciate people telling when or what to buy , whatever I buy should be my decision and on my own time. 

He always wants me to buy him some new video game or clothes. He will show me some game or TV or console on Amazon. He even wants shirts or shoes from Nike or Adidas. 

BTW , we have never bought each other anything, expect for Christmas , but it's mainly because I'm generally uncomfortable with people buying me things unless its like the holidays. ADDITIONALLY, he works , and I dont. His family has a pretty decent amount of money and as I just mentioned HE WORKS, i mean if you want something that bad , how about YOU buy it, he has the money to do so. I dont go to school now because of my busy schedule and im a paid intern at a company . Currently i pay off for everything with inheritance money, and im pretty spoiled so my parents too. 

Isn't it a bit odd for a guy to ask a girl to buy him something or is it just me? 
How can I get him out of this habit? 
Why is he doing this ?

We basically spend everyday together; either going back home together from school or going on dates during the weekend or on breaks between trimesters. I know she loves me a lot and cares for me very much and I equal feel the same way about her. She’s also had a really rough past with her ex, few years back, who cheated on her so she knows what it feels like to be in the receiving end. 

But for some fucking reason I have this paranoia of her either cheating on me or breaking up with me. I basically only think about it when I’m not with her and especially when I find time to contemplate (e.g. in the shower) on days when I don’t see her at all. 

It could be that I just spend time with her too much or I think this relationship is too good that I start creating problems for myself. 

If it is, that I spend too much time with her the best solution may be to spend less time with each other but I really, really dislike that idea. It seems as if we’re putting a wall between us and it feels like what a dying relationship would do.

The paranoia is starting get worse and worse and I need help. Why do I keep getting paranoid and what should I do to stop it. 

tl;dr: very healthy relationship but I’m getting paranoid that my gf is cheating on me or going to break up with me. Need help! 

Edit: writing this made me realize some important points I should add. This my first real relationship I’ve ever had.

I realized that there are a few minor problems:
• my gf did dump me once around two years ago but that was because she just broke up with her ex and she wasn’t really ready for a relationship again.
• my gf has mentioned before that “I am just right” in terms of looks; meaning not too ugly nor not too good looking which has definitely hurt my self confidence to an extent 
• although I have warned her and she already stopped, she had been a little too physical with other guys: sitting on another guys lap, putting head on another guy’s shoulder, and kissing another guy’s cheek or kissing the lips of another girl (she is straight tho)

t2_3akkhafg,1553815140.0,b6pw4l,t3_b6pw4l,53,"So I noticed my cousin was affectionate and flirting with this boy during a neighborhood party last weekend. I don't think there's any good reason for a 14 year old to be flirting with a 20 year old. I don't even think there's a good reason for them to talk to each other like that, so I interfered. I just went there and told my cousin that her mom was looking for her, took her to my aunt and uncle, told them what happened and they asked me to take her home.

I took her some advice, told her that it's not appropriate or safe for her to be talking to boys that are that much older than her. She said she likes talking to boys and I told her that she should just hang out with boys who are her own age, that's fine. She seemed to understand it, I'm sure my uncle and aunt will give her the same advice.

Once I was back to the party, I told my girlfriend what happened. Earlier today, she came to me and accused me of overstepping my bounds and being controlling towards my cousin, saying I'm ""baby""ing her and she should make her own decisions. I don't agree with this mindset, I think I was just looking out for her and it was for her own good. She's 14 and can be stupid (like I was at that age). Girlfriend believes I have no rights to make that judgement.

She has demanded that I apologize to my cousin and promise her that this will not happen again, and I really can't make that promise nor am I going to apologize, because I don't think I did anything wrong and I'd do it again.

Relationship length is 8 months.

Recently my mom came to visit since I had to be hospitalized (I’m ok now). A package from amazon arrived this morning for me; the package in question was a gun controller for my PlayStation VR headset. She has been going all day about how violent games are evil and how I’m wasting my life away doing nothing noteworthy of it. How I’m still immature and how I should stop “my little games”. 

She’s been pretty hurtful about it too, comparing me with others from my generation that are now homeowners and / or married (IMO it’s easy to be a homeowner when costs are 8x lower in your hometown compared to a big city such as where I live). 

She also says she’s dissapointed I spend so much time on my phone, even when I tell her I’m actually replying to some important conversations, which she doesn’t believe I have. 

No matter what I do or say I’m a failure when compared to others my age, or at least that’s today’s argument.  She says I’m living in a ”virtual unreality” and that my depression isn’t real but rather caused by my hobbies. 

She’s a great mom otherwise, but she won’t accept my hobbies (even though nowadays I indulge in 5 hours a week at most on games due to work / excercise) and won’t be happy until I stop. 

I game because I do not have that many friends on my new city. What can I tell her to get her to back off a little? Or is she right?

Thanks in advance!

Mary and I have been friends since childhood. She’s been dating this guy Mark for a year and he hasn’t made a great impression on me and I’m reaching a point where I feel like I need to flat out tell Mary that Mark is an ass and that she can do way better. Here are some things that happened with Mark:

1. He’s a bad house guest. My boyfriend and I invited Mary and Mark to our home for the weekend. He called his friends who live in the area, gave them our address, and invited them over without asking for permission from me or my boyfriend. His friends arrived and were waiting on our porch when he finally asked if he can let them in. What was I supposed to do at that point? Then he said he was going to some local bar with them, and that we could pick him up when we were ready to go out for dinner later in the evening. Mary did not go with them. So basically, he invited strangers into my home without asking and then left his girlfriend behind while he hung out with his friends and then demanded to be picked up from the bar, as if I was his chauffeur or something. I was waiting for Mary to speak up and say “Mark that’s rude, you can’t just invite people over, this isn’t our house.” But Mary didn’t say anything. 

2. My boyfriend and I met up with Mary and Mark in their neighborhood for drinks one evening. The guys ordered beers, Mary and I ordered rum and cokes. My boyfriend offered to buy the first round. Mark pulled out his wallet and said “I got this. You can get the next one.” When we went to order our second round of drinks, we ordered the same things, except this time Mark ordered an expensive drink that was over $30. My boyfriend paid because Mark had gotten the first round. I thought that was incredibly sneaky of him to offer to buy drinks when he ordered a $5 beer, but then ordered a $35 drink when he know someone else was paying for it. Again, Mary didn’t say anything to Mark about this being rude. 

3. Mark does acting for a hobby and invited us to see a show he was performing in. My boyfriend and I went to support him. After the show, we got drinks. Mary ordered one drink for herself and then tried to pay for it with her card, but there was a $20 minimum. Mary didn’t have cash on her, so I suggested she order two drinks and either drink them both or give one to Mark, but she didn’t want to do that (I don’t understand why??) Mark was just standing there like an idiot.. we were waiting for him to pay for Mary’s drink but after an awkward couple of minutes, my boyfriend pulled cash out of his wallet and paid for Mary’s drink. Both Mary and Mark disappeared afterwards and didn’t hang out with us, which was so rude considering we drove over an hour to see them. 

4. When I visited Mary and spent the night at her house, Mark ordered a pizza for us. He only let me eat one slice and then put the rest away, even though I said I would take a second slice. When he was a guest in my house, they got their own room and bathroom, I cooked breakfast for him, and drove him around everywhere. But this asshole wouldn’t let me have two slices of pizza.

5. He posts politically charged comments on my social media. He publicly berates me for my political views. 

It sucks because I love Mary and I want to support her. She’s never been happier, and I’m happy that she’s happy, but Mark is just so terrible. And it’s starting to rub off onto her because Mary has been starting to act like him too and she doesn’t call him out on his bullshit. Am I justified in thinking he’s terrible or am I being unreasonable?

t2_11lpjm,1553823624.0,b6rduq,t3_b6rduq,0," **Backstory:**

I'm (27) the youngest of 4 girls ( 31, 34, 37) plus 1 Stepbrother(33) . My parents got divorced when I was 6. I moved in with my Father and he got remarried and gained custody a few years later to a narcissistic woman who drank a lot and always commented on how terrible my father's birth children were. After a lot of childhood trauma: Mother did not take good care of us 4 girls when she had custody (partied a lot, brought home random men, turned me and my sisters playroom into a sex room and put a lock on the room, didn't make sure we were bathed, etc.); My stepmother calling my sister's a slew of horrible things at young ages (and into our adult years extending onto my older sister's children and choice of spouses), and starting physical altercations with my sister's and I in our teenage years, and my father not defending us and instead just defending her ""being drunk"". 

   
 

My sister lets call her K, closest in age to me, (31 yo, and also my grandmother's favorite) moved out at a young age due to the emotional abuse from my stepmother (as did we all), ended up living in her car/crashing on couches with a crazy druggie ex-boyfriend for a few months and then to an apartment with him, later leaving him due to the abuse from him. My Grandmother gave her a free place to live in her second home that no one lived in (all rent free/utility free/she'd even buy her specifically groceries). My sister lived here from age 21 until age 31 completely free. I lived with my sister in this house from ages 18-21. I ended up moving out at age 21 because she, sister K, would get angry and put her hands on me over me coming home at 10pm (I worked late shifts), or having my TV on in my bedroom to fall asleep at a low volume. My sister K, on top of the free rent/utilities, started to get assistance from my father $300 per month to ""help"" her pay for food and gas while in college working on a degree even though she worked as a babysitter on the side. My father continued to do this all the way up until the completion of her Master's degree.

   
 

My father helped me with some trade schooling (student loans not available for trade school when I was 18 or 19, which I finished but did not make an impact in financial career growth after staying in the field for several years and working my way up to manager. After moving out from living with my sister due to her anger issues, I moved into an apartment with my now fiance. I spent time in the career field that I got a trade licensure with and I figured out what I wanted to do with my life (become a registered nurse). I spent the next 2 years discussing my plans with my Stepmother and Father and requesting similar financial assistance they were already providing to my sister ($300 dollars per month). They consistently told me it was NOT something I would be good at or want to do and that they were not going to help me in any way. In addition my father stated that assisting my sister was different than assisting me because I choose to move out of the house my sister K was living in (rent free) to live with my boyfriend. After finally convincing them that this was my dream, my Father agreed to help me financially while I was in school at the same amount he was assisting my sister monthly. I was grateful. I did everything they asked of me, while continuing to work/took out my own loans to pay for schooling and go to school taking 16-18 credits per semester, I remained neutral in all the fights my drunk stepmother would call me about at 1am, and tried to grin and bear it.

   
 

**Fast Forward:**

In 2015 I was in my last year of Nursing school to get my associate's degree. My Father and stepmother new that my lease renewal was coming up and offered for me to come live with them until finishing my degree. I was reluctant, but thought it would be good financial move for my future. I moved in and very much began to relive my childhood. My stepmother and father would be fighting and she would be drunk. I remained in my bedroom and studied. One evening before my first nursing clinical for school (hospital unit shadowing/working) I came downstairs in my pajamas (t-shirt and loose shorts) at about 9pm to get some water before continuing to study. My stepmother was drunk sitting on the couch beside my father. I walked back to my bedroom and got a text message from her stating, ""don't dress like a slut in front of your father, it's disgusting"". I was shaking. I came downstairs and told my father what she said. She stood up and mocked me. And said I was trying to get my father to look at my body. My father let her continue to mock me until I said to him how can you allow her to speak to me like this, I am your daughter. He finally told her to stop. Then he later made me go speak to her one on one even though she was wasted. She told me that nursing school was not hard and that my K and I think we are all better than her for going to college but we have no idea what it's like to be a single mother and not have money for coffee filters (WTF). I remained calm and exited that conversation very fast. My father apologized for her behavior and said ""she's just drunk"". This was the last straw. I knew I had to move out. My fiancé and I moved back in together. I finished working on my degree. 

   
 

Two days prior to my Associates Graduation date (Weird graduation date due to summer time graduation) I called my father and stepmother. I told them my graduation date. My stepmother had previously thrown 2 graduation parties for my sister K for her associates degree and bachelors degree, as well as a high school graduation for her son (my stepbrother). Whenever my stepbrother's birthday was coming up, she'd text the entire family and tell them the upcoming important date. Since this was my first graduation (I got my GED), I was really feeling proud of myself. Come my graduation day, I received no phone calls or texts from anyone in my family. I received numerous congratulations from my fiancé's family. I was still very disappointed in my family. The next day I sent a group message to my family (sisters, stepbrother, father, and stepmother) stating, ""Just to inform everyone, I graduated from nursing school yesterday and not one of you called or messaged me and it has really hurt my feelings."" My sisters immediately called and apologized and alerted my birth mother. She did not know, as we see each other maybe 1x a year and talk rarely. I did not expect for my sisters/stepbrother to know unless my father and stepmother told them. They didn't tell anyone. My father called me and was not sure why I was so upset. He said, ""I don't see the big deal, it's an associates degree, not a bachelors degree, it's just a stepping stone."" I tried to explain he had never said he was proud of me my entire life and I just thought for once he would say it on my graduation day, or at least remember my date. My stepmother sent me several text messages stating how an associates degree is not to be celebrated, as it's not a bachelors degree too and that it was wrong of me to make her look bad and I was playing the victim.

   
 

After a week, I sent my father a long letter and decided to end all communication with him and his wife. I have the saved letter if anyone is interested in reading it. I changed my phone number and tried to move on. 

   
 

**Now**

It's been almost 2 years now since I've had contact with them. From what I hear their relationship is rocky from my sister K says and my stepmom continues to bad mouth my sisters and my father's mother. My father has not visited his elderly mother for any major holidays this year or when her dog died because my stepmother ""can't stand her"", which deeply saddens me. My sister K and I have visited my grandmother and included her in our holiday plans. However, this is the same grandmother who has paid my sisters rent for 10 years, I feel my sister owes this to her. Maybe I'm wrong. I found out that my grandmother broke her hip and was in rehab for 4 weeks. My sister visited her twice the entire time, my father only once. I did not visit, we have never been close due to the favoritism she has always had for my sister. (Even when I was little and she would baby sit my sister K and I, my sister K would punch me in the stomach so hard I could not breath. I would cry and try to call my parents. My grandmother would unplug the phone line and with the help of my sister K open the bathroom door with a butter knife and spank me.)

   
 

My sister K got engaged and moved out of my grandmothers extra home (now living rent free with her fiance). She left her dog and cat at my grandmothers second home and goes there 2x per day to let them out and feed them. She has told me she can't wait for the dog to die. Which breaks my heart, my pets are my world. She even took him to the vet to find out how long he has to live. (He's ten years old, he's not on deaths door). Prior to moving she took at 35,000 dollar loan out for a brand new car and she pays $500 per month for it not to mention the high cost of her insurance due to her horrible record. I find it hard to have any real desire to have a deep sibling connection with my sisters. The other 2 are older and have kids and don't live nearby. One of which gets mad when I don't respond to her texts. My sister K, I have told her how I felt about her getting so much assistance and not having any responsibilities as well as the treatment of her animals. She respected my feelings and does not let it get in the way of our touch and go relationship (shes a counselor).

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* :  Is it wrong or justified for not wanting to have a deeper relationship with my mother, father, stepmother, sisters, stepbrother? My mother texts me throughout the week to say I love you but I feel like we have no common ground. (I started seeing her 1-2x per year ever since I was in my late teens). Am I wrong/justified for cutting off all contact with my stepmother and father after my graduation. How would you of handled the events I went through? Is it wrong for thinking my sister K hand everything handed to her and now can't even take responsibility for her pets? Would I be the wrong if my parents reached out and apologized but I never let them back into my life? Did I expect too much from my parents?",relationships,I [27 F] cut off all communication with Father &amp; Stepmother. What would you of done?

When it happened it really hurt me. The first month without him around was really rough, I cried a lot and had really bad anxiety and depression. I made different accounts to try and reach out to him, but never got a response. I quickly gave up and slowly accepted the fact that he probably wasn't coming back. I tried to meet new people during this time, but it was never the same. Our friendship has pretty much always been rocky like this we argue about something or friction builds and we get angry at each other, but this time is different he had never ghosted me like this before. By the second month I completely gave up hope that I'd ever talk to him again. Now he's just back and want to scrape it under the rug like nothing ever happened and I'm still really hurt by what he did. He told me that I'm irreplaceable and he made a terrible mistake. He's apologized, but after all I pain I experienced before and after I don't know if I should forgive him. Part of me is really happy he's back, but I feel like he's just given up on finding someone else to replace me. He's my best friend, but I really don't feel like I'm his. When things are going well though we have amazing chemistry and despite trying to meet new people nobody has made me as happy as he does. I just don't know what to do. 

Tl;dr Best friend comes back after two months of ghosting me. He really hurt me leading up to it and by doing it. Not sure if I should take him back.

I can go a week without him, but two is so, so, so difficult for me. We’ve talked about this a few times, but it doesn’t get any easier. Breaking up wouldn’t solve anything. I’m not better without him. We have a happy, healthy relationship besides this issue. 

I try and keep myself busy. I do schoolwork, stuff around the house, sports. I don’t have many friends and my family isn’t that fun to hang out with. The hardest part is that I never know when I’m going to see him. It’s always “maybe this weekend”, “maybe maybe maybe, soon soon soon”. I’m sick of it. I just want a firm answer.

t2_7odo4rl,1553823166.0,b6rb76,t3_b6rb76,1,"So my siblings and I (F29)have always lived in the same house together, I moved out twice for about a year each time and they havent. I am F(29) and I have two sisters 22 and 26 and a brother 17. We used to fight a lot as kids and teenagers but as adults we pretty much get along. We all have the same habits because we have been living in the same household for so long so we dont really fight as much. 
A part of me feels that because of this living situation we have sort of lost touch and connection in a small sense. When I moved out once and came to visit I felt we connected more, lots of hugs and kisses hello and goodbye and I stood hanging out with them rather than going to my room or my siblings going to theirs but since they dont see me they would stay for an hour or so to hang out. 
I feel we are so busy with our lives and since we live together we dont make time to hang out, except for birthdays etc. The most we do is we watch tv a lot and cook and hang in the kitchen, which I'm happy for so I dont even know why i feel I have to give so much background details.

But the thing is my sister (26) is engaged (about 6 months in) and shes been with him since she was 17 so hes basically my brother (he is here everyday) My problem is that as sisters  I think we should feel more excited. Like going with her to try dresses on and helping pick things and all that stuff people usually do or maybe I just see it in movies and assume real people can express things so easily. I'm happy for her and I wish I could be more active and stop thinking what I should be doing. I keep wanting to make a website for her, but I dont. It's like we say a lot together and agree on things but never do it and we literally sleep right next to each other in the attic (separate rooms). My sister is the type of person who goes all out for people at parties like just today there was a decorations she bought for a baby shower coming up. I get what shes doing, shes doing this so that when she has parties people help. She once threw herself a party and no one helped her with anything. She always brings stuff or makes sweet tables etc for others but thats just how my family is (aunts and cousins) everyone brings a dish or helps out so idk why no one helped her that time (maybe it was bad timing). So her wedding is coming up and I'm wondering if people are going to help. We are a very creative family where we like to DIY and save a buck. 

I always feel awkward when I get close to my family. Idk why, we have always been close, but not close of you get me. We talk about our day and stuff and topics but like when my gramps passed I remember my mom so sad and I hugged her all but I still feel like I couldnt be there 100 and open up , these people are my people why do I feel this way? The only person I can ever feel 90 percent open to is my partner (M30) and young kids such as my little cousins or babies.

t2_zv5mj,1553822570.0,b6r7kd,t3_b6r7kd,2,"I am in college. Ive lived on campus (in a big city, totally fine on my own) then in an apartment with an SO for about a year. But after a rough breakup, i’ve moved back in with my mom. I have plans to move out again at the end of the summer.

Until then, my moms anxiety has been severely affecting my social life. She is very terrified of something happening to me, which i completely understand. But i think the absolute lack of taking any risks is making me isolated and lonely.

She won’t let me take uber/lyft alone, can’t take public transit after dark, etc. because she’s worried something bad will happen to me. If i make plans to take a lyft, she’ll just drive me instead. But then i feel guilty for the inconvenience, and like i can’t stay out late because she wants to go to bed. Also, it’s embarrassing to have my mom drop me off and pick me up. 

I had a coffee date from tinder last week and she completely stressed me out beforehand, making me promise i wouldn’t leave the coffee shop. then reminding me off all the homework and chores i should be doing instead of a date (it was like one hour!!!! and the only social interaction i’ve had in weeks!!) by the time I got there I was almost crying and just wanted to cancel the date. 

I’ve had to cancel plans because my mom is too busy and stressed out. She can’t accomplish anything if i’m out with someone new or somewhere in the city at night because she needs to watch my location and make sure i’m staying where i should be and not kidnapped or something.

I’d like to go to someone’s apartment as a third date, we’ve been talking for a few weeks and i feel comfortable with it, but i’m already anticipating that my mom will say it’s too soon and i shouldn’t trust them yet. 

The biggest problem is that SHE CONVINCES ME to be anxious as well. She talks about all the bad things that could happen to me and get me all nervous and freaked out so i don’t even wanna go anymore. 

I’m getting really frustrated, but i really don’t know how to change the situation/boundaries, or if i just have to wait until i have enough money to move out. Does anyone have experience with a situation like this? 

after my date last week she said she can’t turn it off, and that she feels responsible since i live with her she has to make sure nothing happens to me or she won’t be able to live with herself. I respect her a lot and feel bad that she gets so stressed out, but I also am at the end of my rope.

No matter how many times i replay the event or write it out or talk about it, I can't seem to move past the frustration and resentment from it. I've even tried a bit of therapy and I'm still stuck ruminating.

My bf (36M) came over to my (31F) place for the day and we'd spent the majority of it in the bedroom. We eventually realized it was late and I needed to cook us dinner. I have very bad acid reflux that acts up if I go too long between meals, so I threw some bread in the toaster hoping it would help calm down the acid build up enough to stop me from puking. 

I grabbed the margarine from my fridge while he sat on the couch watching. He told me not to butter the toast because it would make the acid worse. Fats don't trigger my reflux, so I responded that it wasn't a problem and it wouldn't upset my stomach, and anyways it was one of those ultra low fat margarines, not a high fat butter. 
He responded with ""Ew, gross."" Got up off the couch, approached me, grabbed the butter knife out of my hand and firmly said ""you're not eating that."" He was completely serious, not joking.

I saw red. I didn't start yelling, but I stood there quietly shaking in anger for a couple of minutes. I took another knife from the drawer, buttered my toast, and (pretty calmly without a raised voice) told him he was totally out of line and if he ever pulled another stunt like that he'd be out. I couldn't even look him in the eye I was so mad.

He got upset, said I was making a big deal over nothing and was way over reacting. Told me ""I don't know why you're mad at me, I'm not abusive."" (Which came out of nowhere, I never used the word abuse at any point in time)

I thought about it, but ultimately said that I wasn't accusing him of being abusive, but I didn't think I was out of line, I'd been managing my reflux for many years and knew my triggers and what was ok to ingest, and he didn't get to decide that for me or control what I eat.

We dropped the topic after that, and he broke up with me a week later, saying I'm full of red flags and have anger issues. 

Thinking about this fight several months later, my blood still boils when I remember him yanking the knife away because he apparently thinks marg is gross. So is he right? Do I have anger issues? Was I in the wrong for being upset? I've tried addressing anger as a whole with CBT and a therapist, but until I'm put in a similarly stressful situation I won't know if I've successfully stomped all anger out of me.

t2_3i00cymc,1553821707.0,b6r2bb,t3_b6r2bb,4,"This is a legit post and I know I’m wrong in many aspects. I’m not here to dispute that. I’m here to seek help and see what options I have with getting some help. So here goes. Gonna be a long post 

I’m currently 39 years old. I’ve been with my wife, let’s call her Janet, since I was 20. When Janet and I first got together, I was the jealous type. She was (still is) smoking hot and instead of being appreciative of a having sexy gorgeous woman on my arm, I’d get mad if I saw other guys looking at her. To put it in perspective, one day fairly early on in our relationship, we went to the beach. On the way home, Janet continued to wear her bikini top. I was seeing guys in other cars trying to ogle her and I got upset and told her to put a shirt on. She didn’t like that. That was the type of stupid shit that started steamrolling out of control. I was wrong. I don’t dispute that. I have insecurities apparently. 

During the first few months of being together, one of her ex-Bfs came into the picture. They were “just friends” is what she had told me so they talk sometime. I wasn’t ok with it and it started arguments more often than not. Eventually my insecurities and possessiveness became too much and we split up. Long story short, she ending up spending a night at his house. During our split, I ended up meeting up with one of my ex’s. When I was with my ex, we talked for a bit and literally NOTHING happened. I realized I didn’t want my ex, I wanted Janet. Janet and I ended up getting back together after about two weeks. I wasn’t happy about what she had told me had happened while we were split but what could I do about it. We technically weren’t together at the time. I promised to change. She believed me. 

Somewhere in the mix, I met a girl at work and started talking to her. Not gonna lie, I wanted to hook up with her but we never did. I ended up telling Janet about it,  and apologized. She was pissed. We fought for a while and ended up trying to fix things. Shortly after that, she told me she was moving to FL to be with her sick mom who was also moving to FL. At the time, we lived in New England. She told me I could come or we could split up but either way, she was going. I decided to leave the only home I’ve ever known and move 1200mi. away with Janet. This was in 2003. 

Once in FL, it was her and I. After paying for the move, we had $400 to our name. We both got jobs and started building our life together. I was still getting jealous over stupid things but kept telling her I’d change and she kept believing me. I really wanted to change and I did for a while. 

Things got real good for us. We both had decent paying jobs and we had a relationship that all our friends were jealous of. We got married in 2007 and in late 2008, had our first child. A beautiful baby girl. After our daughter was born, I was putting in 50+ hours a week at my job and a lot of those hours were night hours where I didn’t get home to close to midnight. My wife, on the other hand, worked Mon-Fri 9-5. We weren’t spending as much time together and apparently she felt like I wasn’t helping out with our daughter as much as she’d like me to have.

While my daughter was about 1, my wife started taking to a guy at her job. Once I found out about it, I was heart broken and confronted the guy. He told me he didn’t want to come between my wife and I and that he was sorry and he wouldn’t talk to my wife anymore. That was the truth. They stopped talking and my wife and I were left to try to fix our relationship. Apparently it didn’t last too long bc she started talking to yet another guy at her job. This guy was married and also had a child about our daughters age. Once I found out about this, I was livid. We fought and at one point, she ended up leaving for two weeks to stay with her mom. Before she left, though, I had tried to confront the new guy she was talking to but he avoided me like the plague. My last resort was to track down his address and go talk to HIS wife. His wife acted like she wasn’t too surprised and like it wasn’t a big deal. Either way, they stopped talking I think. Who knows. 

Fast forward a couple months and I find yet ANOTHER guy at her job was trying to talk to her. I confronted him, too.  My wife didn’t do anything really wrong here per-say, but she didn’t tell me someone else was trying to talk to her. 

Fast forward to today. Since all that BS happened, it’s been close to 10 years. Our daughter is 10 and we also have a 5 year old son now, too. I love both my kids more than life itself. I’m also still head over heels in love with my wife but I do not know how to let go of the past. I do not 100% trust her and I don’t know how to get over that. I honestly don’t want to be with or have eyes for anyone else but her. But she’s tired of me not fully trusting her. 

I WANT to trust her. I really do but I don’t know how to. It’s been 10 years since all that but she still works with that one guy who’s wife I had to talk to. I don’t think anything is going on but I don’t know how to stop thinking that something is. 

My mind works in fucked up ways. If I don’t hear from my wife on her lunch break, my mind automatically thinks she’s somewhere with him. Or if she has to leave the house to go to the store, I automatically think she’s running off to secretly meet someone. 99% of the time, I keep these thoughts to myself or I’ll ask subtle questions to see what she’s up to. I don’t want to feel this way. Occasionally, I’ll say something stupid and she’ll know that I don’t trust her. At this point, she’s tired of living like this and is contemplating leaving. We’re about to start counseling together so I’m really hoping that it can help us/me. How do I get over my insecurities and trust my wife again 100%. How do I stop these thoughts that I have. Let’s be clear, I don’t think she is doing anything right now with anyone but my mind automatically jumps to that all the time.  I hate being this way and feeling like this but at the same time, I seriously don’t want to be with anyone else but her.

There’s more I can get into but for the time being, I think this sufficiently explains our current situation. 

Please fell free to ask my any questions or if you want me to be more specific about anything I said. I’ll be 100% honest about everything.  

TLDR: I’ve had jealously problems for my whole almost-20yr relationship with my wife. She’s “cheated” on me in the past and I don’t know how to get over it for her sake and mine. I do not want to be like this. How do I overcome this?

t2_1z2kqvv9,1553817289.0,b6qadu,t3_b6qadu,19,"Hey there redditors!

So, I have a doubt that has been running around my mind since I graduated from high school.

First off, let me clarify one thing, I have a girlfriend and we've been together for more than 4 years and I love her with all my heart, and I am super happy with her on my side.

Now that I moved that out of the way, the story goes off like this (I'm gonna try to be as brief as possible here)

So I met my highschool crush (let's call her X due to a lack of imagination) when I was  15 (now I am 21) and when I met her we had 2 years left before we graduated.

Alright so basically she was in all of my classes and so I just fell in love with her but I never really acted on those feelings because I was kinda shy (now that is not the case) but yeah, anytime I had the chance to make a move I would basically screw everything up, like one time we were walking on the street heading home and she said she was cold and I had my jacket in my hand I replied ""yeah I know right?"" And I never gave her the jacket or whatever lol. 
Opportunities like this came a lot of times because we would always head out to the same direction when we were going home after school.

We were never really close buuuut we talked a bunch of times, we were friends on Facebook, followed each other on Twitter and stuff like that.

One day I was like ""ah screw it"" and I declared my feelings towards her on FACEBOOK LOL so yeah that happened and she was pretty shocked because she never saw it coming, but she basically replied ""sorry but I'm not interested"" and I accepted it and moved on.

The thing is that after I declared my feelings she was acting weird, like one time she was pointing to her cheek kinda like saying ""hey aren't you going to say hi and kiss me? (On the cheek of course) and because I still liked her I went ahead and kissed her on the cheek lol.

But yeah fast forward I met my current girlfriend in my last year of high school (she was from another school) and X would ask me things about her like what was her name, her last name (because apparently she wanted to know if she met her before from the school my gf went to) and stuff like that which was kinda weird because I was like ""didn't she give a crap about me? Why would she care about my gf so much?"" 

Fast forward a couple of months later a party went down and X was there, she was a bit drunk that night, and she would ask me how did she look from a scale from 1 to 10 and stuff like that and she even said to one of her friends to stay away because she wanted to make out with me! And I was shocked (I was already in a relationship with my current gf so I was never going to cheat on her) but next day at school I never asked X about that.

So yeah now a couple of years later I just have a lot of curiosity about wether or not she had feelings for me back then in high school after she wanted to kiss me on that party and stuff like that.




I'm not interested in asking her out or anything like that because as I said before I have a girlfriend and I would never want to leave her, I even asked her what did she think about me messaging X and stuff and she was okay with it because she felt like it's a normal thing that guys have from their high school days, ha! 

This ""need"" to ask her what she thought of me usually reappears when I dream about her (which happens a few times a year) and in those dreams we just hang around for a while (small talk), then I just wake up and I have the doubt floating my mind for a little while of ""What did she think of me back in high school?...) until it's gone again. 



TL;DR: Is it weird if after almost 5  years of never seeing or speaking to each other I ask my high school crush via DM or something if she ever had a thing for me or should I just leave it and have the doubt forever? (A little bit exaggerated huh lol) 

Cheers!",relationships,Should I ask my highschool crush..?

Well, we stayed friends on social media and we used to chat a couple times a month.

So, to me, it's pretty clear that he's lying, because I've asked him if he was really still interested etc. All the time, he tells me he is, he's just busy, blah blah. And I almost feel like he borders into gaslighting me by telling me that I'm essentially overthinking everything and we're fine, even though I've been noticing things were off.
Also, it took him over 17 hours to look and reply to my last message, which was about hanging out, and he said he'd ""let me know"". As if MY time isn't important. I'd like to know if I should keep my schedule open or not. Then, I realize that if I made other plans, he wouldn't even care. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point, because I know he actually is having it rough. But this is also not acceptable to me. Can anyone just please tell me that I'm not being crazy or unfair here? That I would be making the right move to end it if he can't make time for me this weekend? Also, I haven't even responded to his message yet, about not being sure if he can do this weekend. I am upset with him and want to go off, but I also want to wait to see if he will make the time or not before I tell him off. Should I tell him that if he doesn't see me, it's over?
 
tldr; Guy claims he likes me, talks everyday for over 3 months, yet only have spent time together 3 nights. He has already put off the 4th meeting for a week and is about to put it off for 2. I don't find this acceptable and also feel like he's gaslighting a bit by acting like I'm essentially overthinking/crazy because I think he doesn't like me anymore. Should I leave?? I don't even know how to reply to him right now about him not being sure if he can see me, I haven't said anything... Should I say that he either makes time for me or it's over, or do I just leave if he doesn't?",relationships,"Me (29F) and guy I've been seeing for 3 mo (31M), clear he's not interested but what should I say?"

I had just worked a 15 hour day, and saw this within the first half hour of arriving at home. I had an immediate melt down. He wouldn't stop insisting he did nothing wrong because he had no intentions of meeting these people. That he found it as an entertaining pass time.   

I still can't believe he doesn't see anything wrong with this. I asked him to show me his tinder. He has been using this app since November. Which had me melt down even further.   

I've told him if he doesn't see an issue with this when I clearly do. I cannot continue this relationship with him. I am unhappy.   

For some extra context. We haven't been intimate for over a month. He will use my weight as the reason why he hasn't been as sexually attracted to me. So seeing him on tinder was another blow to my self esteem. Not only am I with a jealous man who would accuse me of being the cheater, he would also put me down because of my weight, in addition to ending sexy times because I've refused to give him anal. So finding him on tinder messaging young and thin women is really fucking with my head.   

Today. Still. He is defending himself. Not giving me clear answers on why he sees the need to use this app. Why he's been on it since November. He won't even tell me if he's either deactivated or deleted the account he has now. Making it clear he has intentions of continuing to use it. I feel so fucking heart broken. I cannot even look at him the same.   

Last night he was laughing at me because I was ""overreacting"" and still isn't taking me seriously when I say I don't want him anymore. I feel so broken down. I hate to say that I do still want him. It's become one of those cliche, my heart wants him but my brain is saying no.   

I feel so lost. How do you people actually stick by your word when you say it's over? It already feels so difficult. I know if I just forgive him. This is just going to happen all over again. But I already feel so burnt out. I just want to give up.

t2_3hxten3e,1553804140.0,b6npzd,t3_b6npzd,48,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for a few years now, and for the most part I have been quite happy. We've talked about and planned the rest of our lives together and see eye-to-eye on a lot of things. And for years we would have to drive 40 minutes to see one another, so we were really excited to be living with each other since it would make things more casual and easy. A few months ago we moved into an apartment together, we had a lot of fun picking out the furniture and setting everything up, and I was anticipating things becoming even better than they were. And I think, from her perspective, they probably are.

But I friggin' hate it. She cleans up after herself and everything, and she is pretty easygoing, but that's the extent of my happiness about it. I think living with her kind of sucks? It's only been a few months but I already find her presence to be oppressive and boring. She is always asking me what I want to do, or what I want to eat for dinner, and I constantly feel as if I need to entertain her. It's like it's up to me to be the interesting or exciting one, as if it's something I even want from *myself*. She makes unhealthy snacks and then pressures me into eating them even though I am trying to be healthier, asking me over and over again if I want them even when I politely decline repeatedly. And this is probably on me, but I feel guilty and pressured to drink or smoke when she is doing so around me. Her cat scratches my furniture. She broke my food processor. She told me she didn't want me to have a group of friends over while she was away because she didn't want that many people in ""her space."" She sleeps until noon. I have to feed her cat and water her plants when she's gone, which is half the time. 

I think all of these alone would be fine, and simple enough to solve with conversations, but when you put them all together on top of all of the other small adjustments and concessions you seem to have to make when you live with someone (like the softness of the bed, or the layout of the kitchen, or whether you're allowed to fall asleep listening to audiobooks, or how the hell you're going to masturbate with someone in the other room and a cat watching you or scratching at the door) it starts to feel insurmountable.

I don't understand what happened. I love this woman, but I am beginning to hate being around her. She goes away for work a lot of the time and I find myself far more excited about when she's away than when she's here; when she's gone it's as if I'm free: I go to weird events with friends she doesn't like or work on side projects with them, and have time to read and write in quiet peace without feeling guilty about ignoring her. 

I don't think that I didn't know what kind of person she was until I moved in with her? Perhaps I didn't know myself well enough. I thought her sleeping in would be endearing, maybe. I thought I wouldn't mind sharing my life with someone and maybe I do? Or is this all standard growing pains when you move in with someone? I need to make this work but half of the time I stare into her loving eyes and can't help but think about how badly I want to jump headfirst out of a window. I can't imagine I wouldn't be immensely happier if she lived down the block instead of in my apartment. Why would anyone ever want to live with anyone else?

**TL;DR:** Just moved in with my girlfriend and I don't like it. Starting to see her differently, pressured and frustrated and bored when she's here, and happier when she's gone. Is it natural? Is it her? Is it me? Is it the relationship?",relationships,"My [27 M] girlfriend [24 F] of 4 years, whom I love, just moved in with me and I totally hate it"

My wife and I were good friends our whole lives and started to date near the end of high school.

We went to the same college together and all through out college there was never a doubt in my mind i would marry this woman. I proposed our senior year of college and got married a week after graduation.

Then 4 months later her mom killed herself.

I tried to be the most supportive husband i could be. I did what ever i think could have helped to ease the suffering she was going through, I tried going out to eat more, taking more vacations, being available for venting/crying etc... She didn't get sad or depressed, she got angry instead. She started lashing out at me frequently for small things. One time she loudly berating me at a restaurant for ""looking at her like i'm scared of her"".

I suggested several times that her and her sister should go see a therapist. She refused every time. I pushed the issue hard one night and her response troubled me, ""I know exactly what to tell a therapist to trick them into thinking i'm fine, so its useless for me to go."" I didn't bring it up again.

I started to see a therapist about a year later for my worsening anxiety and depression issues. I felt my therapist leading me down the path that this anxiety and depression is stemming from myself not getting what i need in a partner.

I finally broke through and she agreed to see my therapist for some marriage counseling. She was angry after our sessions because our therapist kept suggesting that she wasn't respecting my boundaries and had unrealistic expectations of my role as a husband. My wife kept stating that since I saw the same therapist for my individual sessions the therapist had an unfair bias toward my feelings and emotions because she had a negative view of her before she stepped in the room for the first time.

Things improved a little bit for a few years until recently I've been struggling hard with depression. I'm seeing a therapist every week and i feel as if my therapist is leading me down the same path. Which is, i'm not getting what i need from a relationship and that my depression is a symptom of that.

One thing that i'm very bad is is communicating my emotional wants/needs. I'm a people pleaser and have a hard time saying no and pushing my opinion. My therapist and i decided to work on this by telling my wife i need some encouragement the next time i feel depressed to see if that helps.

So the other night i was feeling sad/depressed so i muscled up the courage to ask my wife for a favor, ""Hey, i'm feeling a bit depressed and need a bit of encouragement.""

She responds with, ""No, i'm not giving it to you because you need to learn to live without it.""

Then she proceeds to go to bed with out saying goodnight.

I want to suggest marriage counseling, but i'm half tempted to not even try. I don't think some one deny's their husband a few kind words is someone who's loved and respected.

I'm not 100% sure how to proceed, I want to give her the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to the tragedy but i'm not sure how much longer i can go on without encouragement and constantly walking on egg shells. It wrecks my world.

t2_17bhty,1553819780.0,b6qqce,t3_b6qqce,24,"So back story on the cats. 

I have a plump tabby that i adopted when i was 19. She is 14, and very sweet. She has lived with a number of other cats in our 12 years together, and always done just fine with them. Not always the best of friends, but was never violent. Maybe a few hisses here and there with cats that are too rowdy or get in her space.

A year ago, before we were engaged, my fiancé adopted a 3 month old female kitten. His son really wanted one, and he saw how great my cat was, so he was sold. We lived separately at that time.

The kitten was, and still is, sweet most of the time. She is energetic and up in everything, but that's part of having a cat. She loves to play, and is very purry and friendly to me, my fiancé and his son. She would have her scary moments where she would play aggressively and scratch and bite, but those moments were playful, not malicious.

Now we have all moved in together. The two cats can't be in the same room, because when they are, his cat attacks my cat so violently that it's terrifying. If you attempt to pull her off, she will attack you, scratching, biting and yowling. My cat basically lives in our very large bedroom with food, water and a litter box in the bathroom for her. His cat mostly stays in the living room or his sons room. 

This arrangement is super annoying- his cat is constantly trying to get into our room to murder my cat. We have to keep a door closed at all times. His cat also recently attacked me so violently for no reason. I woke up on a Saturday morning and had a cuddle with my girl. I got up to make coffee and saw his cat sleeping on his sons bed, so i went over and gave her some purrs and kisses. She was happy and loving, until she just sort of snapped and started biting and scratching me. I tried to get up and she went after my bare legs. His son came in to help me and she hissed at him.

I know you aren't supposed to re home animals, and i would feel awful doing It, but this isn't fair to me or my cat. I don't like seeing all of us covered in scratches and cuts from her reigns of terror, or from grabbing her before she can lunge in and attack my cat. I want to have a baby in the next 2-3 years, and i would 100% not feel comfortable having this cat anywhere near a baby. 

My fiancé and his son love their cat, and don't want to give her away. They want to give It more time for the cats to get along. We have tried all the methods of introducing them slowly, we have tried feliway, pills to sedate his cat, nothing is working. I am not going to put my 14 year old cat through a potential attack every day, so there is no way I'm letting them just fight It out amongst themselves.

What do you all think?

The story:

He was involved in a fender bender and when he pulled out his phone to show me a photo, I noticed he had been texting with a girl I didn’t recognise and asked him. Turned out to be a former neighbour who he still spoke to.

This lead to the question of whether there was anyone else out there he texted a lot. And then he mentioned this girl, who he mentioned as one of his best friends, that he texts daily.

No screaming match or anything so dramatic just me saying these things:
‘At the point in our relationship I felt like I should have been aware of anyone you’re close enough to text with on a daily basis’
‘What would your opinion be if you just found out that I’d been texting with a guy on a daily basis’
His response was more to the fact that ‘he hasn’t seen her in four years’

Day after and I’m just feeling it’s sitting worse with me (as far as I’m aware I’ve heard of other male friends he texts frequently, could have brought her up before - I’m in the middle of studying the subject she studied etc)

So my general question is this, what would your reaction be? I’m looking for perspective on whether I’m making a mountain out of a mole hill or whether I should talk to him and say this has thrown me for a loop but let’s just move past it

I wanted to also tell the story before I gave a little more background.
I’m a divorcee, my marriage broke up because my husband cheated on me, but more do in hindsight spent hours on the phone texting his girlfriend and hiding in the bathroom to do it as well.
I’m also Larry’s first serious long-term girlfriend, so I give him a large benefit of the doubt for being naive.

Not sure how much that impacts the base question of requesting your reaction but I will freely admit I am sensitive to phone use and have been upfront with Larry day one that trust is my biggest issue.

t2_2j2e3ujr,1553817080.0,b6q8zd,t3_b6q8zd,15,"(Sorry in advance if this post turns our very lengthy) 

Me and my boyfriend are both virgins but we are not religious and do not plan on waiting until marriage to have sex.

From the start, we were pretty physical with each other. We did light sexual stuff at first and it slowly escalated throughout our relationship. To preface this, he was never really comfortable with me pleasuring him. To this day, I’ve never giving him a handjob, blowjob, nothing. Whenever I have tried to, he always ends up telling me to stop. He says he might be too sensitive ‘down there’.  He is also a bit insecure down there (even though it is perfect (above average size))

So almost two years into our relationship was the first time I initiated having sex (it shocks me too). We were at my house and, surprisingly, no one was home. (And when you’re at this age, it’s pretty rare when you have the entire house to yourself with no parents or siblings around) We were doing some sexual stuff but after nothing escalating after awhile, I asked him if he wanted to “do it”. He asked me if I thought we were ready to have sex. I said yes and he even agreed! But he told me another time would be a better time (for whatever reason).

Since then, there has been SEVERAL PERFECT opportunities to have sex for the first time. I have always been the one to initiate the sex. Every single time he would turn me down and give an excuse like it’s not a good time or that he was nervous, etc.

Ever since we started college, we have had significantly more freedom and trust with our families and we have the house to ourselves much more frequently. The closest we’ve been to sex was on our 3rd anniversary. We showered together then went into his room. We were doing sexual stuff and then he got up and asked if he should get a condom. Excitedly, I was like heck yeah. But obviously, like most virgin couples, there was condom struggles so we surrendered. I wasn’t as upset because at least he initiated it this time. 

Whenever we have an opportunity to have sex now, I don’t even want to ask. I figured if he really wanted to have sex, he would initiate it. But every time we have a chance to have sex, he never initiates it. It’s been four months since that occurrence and we have had plenty of opportunities. 

I have confronted him many times about this issue. When I confront him he says he genuinely wants to have sex with me, but he feels weird/nervous when it comes down to it... But we know everything about each other, we are very familiar with each other’s bodies, we are sexually intimate(disregarding intercourse), we are so close... Why doesn’t he feel comfortable? I know he takes sex very seriously, but so do I. I think maybe he is hyping sex up too much. I guess he is insecure and is “sensitive”. But I mean, he is able to masturbate just fine from what he tells me. He says he wants to have sex with me but it does not seem that way. There are specific times and days when there is no one at his house besides himself for a prolonged amount of time. Why won’t he just ask me to come over then? I know he doesn’t want it to feel “forced” but I mean he has to take some sort of initiative for it to happen! This issue harbors a lot of resentment on my part. I feel rejected, unwanted, undesirable, and most of all, frustrated. What do I do? I’ve confronted him so many times and nothing has changed.... at this point it makes me feel kind of pathetic. I feel like I’m begging him to have sex with me. I am honestly just SO fed up at this point. I mean shouldn’t he want to have sex with me?! Not to mention, I am the one that always carries around the condoms (and he knows I always have them just in case)

And something else—ever since we tried to have sex that one time. He complained about the condoms and asked why wouldn’t I just take birth control. I had my reasons not to but I recently developed ovarian cysts so now I have to take birth control. I’ve been on the birth control for about two months now. I mean doesn’t that excite him? Shouldn’t he be even more inclined to have sex now that he won’t have to worry about condoms?! But still absolutely no initiative! I just wish he would care enough to initiate and plan a time for us to have sex. I feel like I’ve done everything to make him feel comfortable enough to have sex with me. 

What can I do to resolve this issue? Why doesn’t he initiate sex if he “wants to have sex”? Is the absence of sex something worth breaking up over? Am I being insensitive? Should I try to be more understanding/patient?

It’s honestly very frustrating to me because I’m young, I have a high libido, I’m in good shape and I have great ideas for interesting things we can do in bed. We have a good, healthy, long-term relationship, we’ve been together for so long... I want us to have sex not just to experience the sex itself but to share this step in our relationship, to experience something amazing together. I just feel SO frustrated over this. Any advice would be appreciated. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have not ever had sex after being together for 3.5 years. He says he wants to have sex with me but I guess lacks the desire to imitate it? I have communicated this to him but nothing has changed.

She was with our kids (three kids total, aged 3-5 years) all week on spring break. She went 2 hours away to her parents for a visit.  I was home all week due to work.  She got home today around 4.  I called her on my way home around 5. 

When I called, I simply asked what we were going to do for dinner as I was hungry and wanted to bring something home.  I suggested Chipotle. She was “too tired to plan” and told me to just come home and we will discuss then.  I’m sightly annoyed because it’s I efficient but whatever. 

I get home.  The kids are asleep.  It’s not the typical nap time but they’re sick so it’s understandable and I don’t really care.  I tried to discuss dinner with her, but again she says she’s too tired and wants to take a 30 minutes.  

In the hour she was napping, I snack on some cheese and lunch meat.  I also get the kids up from their late naps.  Wife wakes up and is of course hungry now and I’m not.  

She orders herself Chipotle and some food for the kids and tells me she’s going to go pick it up. I’m annoyed at this point because I wanted Chipotle for dinner, but I filled up on cheese and lunch meat because she refused to plan wit me.   I say okay... 20 minutes goes by and she’s perplexed as to why I haven’t left to get the food.  Fine...I go pick up the food.  

When I return home, I’m pissy.  I’m annoyed that she refused to plan dinner with me or let me know what she was doing so I could plan around her.  I’m annoyed because of the lack of planning has made it such that it’s 8:30, the kids need to be bathed, and I need to leave the house by 4am tomorrow for work. 

I pretty calmly express my frustration. No yelling or anything but I’m curt.  I tell her I’m annoyed about dinner, I’m annoyed about it being so late and that 2 minutes of planning would have helped all of this. She she plops her chipotle in front of me and tells me to eat it because she’s not hungry anymore because “we don’t have a good marriage anymore.”  

All I want is for her to communicate her needs/desires/plans so we can plan accordingly together.  We both work full time.  We have three young kids.  It’s exhausting, I get it.  How do we plan better?  I’ve been asking for better communication for months.  Is it me at this point? 

FWIW, she has been with the kids at her parents house all week. I’m sure she’s tired.  She’s annoyed with me because I’m also tired I’ve clocked nearly 80 hours this week at work - did it to get caught up while she’s away.  I just don’t know how to get her to understand, I can’t anticipate her needs if she doesn’t communicate them.

t2_3i00cymc,1553821707.0,b6r2bb,t3_b6r2bb,5,"This is a legit post and I know I’m wrong in many aspects. I’m not here to dispute that. I’m here to seek help and see what options I have with getting some help. So here goes. Gonna be a long post 

I’m currently 39 years old. I’ve been with my wife, let’s call her Janet, since I was 20. When Janet and I first got together, I was the jealous type. She was (still is) smoking hot and instead of being appreciative of a having sexy gorgeous woman on my arm, I’d get mad if I saw other guys looking at her. To put it in perspective, one day fairly early on in our relationship, we went to the beach. On the way home, Janet continued to wear her bikini top. I was seeing guys in other cars trying to ogle her and I got upset and told her to put a shirt on. She didn’t like that. That was the type of stupid shit that started steamrolling out of control. I was wrong. I don’t dispute that. I have insecurities apparently. 

During the first few months of being together, one of her ex-Bfs came into the picture. They were “just friends” is what she had told me so they talk sometime. I wasn’t ok with it and it started arguments more often than not. Eventually my insecurities and possessiveness became too much and we split up. Long story short, she ending up spending a night at his house. During our split, I ended up meeting up with one of my ex’s. When I was with my ex, we talked for a bit and literally NOTHING happened. I realized I didn’t want my ex, I wanted Janet. Janet and I ended up getting back together after about two weeks. I wasn’t happy about what she had told me had happened while we were split but what could I do about it. We technically weren’t together at the time. I promised to change. She believed me. 

Somewhere in the mix, I met a girl at work and started talking to her. Not gonna lie, I wanted to hook up with her but we never did. I ended up telling Janet about it,  and apologized. She was pissed. We fought for a while and ended up trying to fix things. Shortly after that, she told me she was moving to FL to be with her sick mom who was also moving to FL. At the time, we lived in New England. She told me I could come or we could split up but either way, she was going. I decided to leave the only home I’ve ever known and move 1200mi. away with Janet. This was in 2003. 

Once in FL, it was her and I. After paying for the move, we had $400 to our name. We both got jobs and started building our life together. I was still getting jealous over stupid things but kept telling her I’d change and she kept believing me. I really wanted to change and I did for a while. 

Things got real good for us. We both had decent paying jobs and we had a relationship that all our friends were jealous of. We got married in 2007 and in late 2008, had our first child. A beautiful baby girl. After our daughter was born, I was putting in 50+ hours a week at my job and a lot of those hours were night hours where I didn’t get home to close to midnight. My wife, on the other hand, worked Mon-Fri 9-5. We weren’t spending as much time together and apparently she felt like I wasn’t helping out with our daughter as much as she’d like me to have.

While my daughter was about 1, my wife started taking to a guy at her job. Once I found out about it, I was heart broken and confronted the guy. He told me he didn’t want to come between my wife and I and that he was sorry and he wouldn’t talk to my wife anymore. That was the truth. They stopped talking and my wife and I were left to try to fix our relationship. Apparently it didn’t last too long bc she started talking to yet another guy at her job. This guy was married and also had a child about our daughters age. Once I found out about this, I was livid. We fought and at one point, she ended up leaving for two weeks to stay with her mom. Before she left, though, I had tried to confront the new guy she was talking to but he avoided me like the plague. My last resort was to track down his address and go talk to HIS wife. His wife acted like she wasn’t too surprised and like it wasn’t a big deal. Either way, they stopped talking I think. Who knows. 

Fast forward a couple months and I find yet ANOTHER guy at her job was trying to talk to her. I confronted him, too.  My wife didn’t do anything really wrong here per-say, but she didn’t tell me someone else was trying to talk to her. 

Fast forward to today. Since all that BS happened, it’s been close to 10 years. Our daughter is 10 and we also have a 5 year old son now, too. I love both my kids more than life itself. I’m also still head over heels in love with my wife but I do not know how to let go of the past. I do not 100% trust her and I don’t know how to get over that. I honestly don’t want to be with or have eyes for anyone else but her. But she’s tired of me not fully trusting her. 

I WANT to trust her. I really do but I don’t know how to. It’s been 10 years since all that but she still works with that one guy who’s wife I had to talk to. I don’t think anything is going on but I don’t know how to stop thinking that something is. 

My mind works in fucked up ways. If I don’t hear from my wife on her lunch break, my mind automatically thinks she’s somewhere with him. Or if she has to leave the house to go to the store, I automatically think she’s running off to secretly meet someone. 99% of the time, I keep these thoughts to myself or I’ll ask subtle questions to see what she’s up to. I don’t want to feel this way. Occasionally, I’ll say something stupid and she’ll know that I don’t trust her. At this point, she’s tired of living like this and is contemplating leaving. We’re about to start counseling together so I’m really hoping that it can help us/me. How do I get over my insecurities and trust my wife again 100%. How do I stop these thoughts that I have. Let’s be clear, I don’t think she is doing anything right now with anyone but my mind automatically jumps to that all the time.  I hate being this way and feeling like this but at the same time, I seriously don’t want to be with anyone else but her.

There’s more I can get into but for the time being, I think this sufficiently explains our current situation. 

Please fell free to ask my any questions or if you want me to be more specific about anything I said. I’ll be 100% honest about everything.  

TLDR: I’ve had jealously problems for my whole almost-20yr relationship with my wife. She’s “cheated” on me in the past and I don’t know how to get over it for her sake and mine. I do not want to be like this. How do I overcome this?

We went to the same college and after we graduated, we both started working and living in the same city.    About a year ago, I changed jobs.  My new job was closer to where he lived.  At the same time, he was looking for another person in his apartment.  So I moved in with his roommates.  About 6 months ago, I realized I had feelings for him, but I held back because he was my roommate, and I was afraid of what might happen if he didn't reciprocate. 

About 4 months ago, Ray lost his mother.  He and his mother were really close, so it was a particularly devastating time for him.  Seeing him go through grief made me want nothing more than to hug him, comfort him, kiss him.  I kept my feelings back for obvious reasons.  However, the other day, he himself admitted his feelings to me.  Told me that he really saw how I was there for him during this time and some other really cute and deep stuff.  

Anyways, now I am (and I bet he is as well) confused on how to move forward.  We are roommates, so I am not sure if we should actually start dating or formalize the relationship so to speak.   I have seen some pretty bad situations where people ended up dating their roommates and it became a massive shit show.  On the other hand, I have known Ray a long time, I would say we are best friends, so I know a lot about him.  Living with him has been the easiest thing I have probably done in my life.  Besides, I can't move out even if I wanted to because the lease has 6 more months to it.

What do you think I should do?

I had just worked a 15 hour day, and saw this within the first half hour of arriving at home. I had an immediate melt down. He wouldn't stop insisting he did nothing wrong because he had no intentions of meeting these people. That he found it as an entertaining pass time.   

I still can't believe he doesn't see anything wrong with this. I asked him to show me his tinder. He has been using this app since November. Which had me melt down even further.   

I've told him if he doesn't see an issue with this when I clearly do. I cannot continue this relationship with him. I am unhappy.   

For some extra context. We haven't been intimate for over a month. He will use my weight as the reason why he hasn't been as sexually attracted to me. So seeing him on tinder was another blow to my self esteem. Not only am I with a jealous man who would accuse me of being the cheater, he would also put me down because of my weight, in addition to ending sexy times because I've refused to give him anal. So finding him on tinder messaging young and thin women is really fucking with my head.   

Today. Still. He is defending himself. Not giving me clear answers on why he sees the need to use this app. Why he's been on it since November. He won't even tell me if he's either deactivated or deleted the account he has now. Making it clear he has intentions of continuing to use it. I feel so fucking heart broken.

t2_3hyy42rq,1553806239.0,b6o51y,t3_b6o51y,23,"A decade ago my mother brought over her siblings from Africa (through some chain migration shit) to the U.S. She had grown up away from them, after having been given away by her parents to her maternal aunt, and when these siblings came over she had this idealized vision of them in her head. Anyway, they came over and everyone got in a big fight and went their separate ways. My mother, who was a single mother, had been expecting her siblings to help out and be a resource and had this fanciful idea of sibling solidarity, however, her siblings were interested in self-advancement and did not seem to show whatever ""gratitude"" my mother expected from them for her effort in bringing them from a hellish situation in a bad part of Africa to the U.S, an effort that cost her many thousands of dollars. I was a kid then and none of this was my business.

Anyway, one of these siblings was my uncle and he lived with us for two or three years when he first arrived. After that he left to another state and I never heard from him again. Anyway, now I'm older and one of his children (still in Africa) has reached out to me on Facebook. He says his old man (my uncle) is out of work and he wants me to send him some money for ""books.""

I'm a young professional, with not a whole lot of money, and unlike my mother, I'm not sure I want to spend my working years sending money to unknown relatives in Africa (i'd rather save for retirement).

t2_3i0jus8c,1553823778.0,b6req9,t3_b6req9,0,"This is long and convoluted, but I am desperate for advice.

I’ve ruined two of my closest friendships. These people were like family to me. I am struggling with depression at the moment, which seriously compromises my rational thinking, but I know it’s no excuse for my behavior. And I’m trying to make an adult decision here on how to make their life have the least amount of pain for the next three months.

Earlier this week I was at a low point, and really paranoid about things. I had taken an Ativan to calm down but it wasn’t helping, it just made me feel more empty. I made a really rash decision and texted them that I wanted them out of my life so I could start with a blank slate. I don’t know why I did this. But this upset them a lot, and it was clear from their text this was the end of our friendship.

I spiraled down from that point. And I need to describe my mental state. It’s hurting me to write this, but I got drunk and went into the forest behind my house with a rope. I’ve tried to tell myself that it wasn’t intentional, or that I was just being dramatic with myself, but I made sure my pets had food and water for two weeks, so I need to be real with myself. I sat in the forest for a while and then chickened out because hanging yourself is painful and then went home. Instead I took a bunch of Ativan and drank more. I changed into a nice outfit and laid down in my bed, really expecting to not wake up because I thought Ativan+alcohol=death. But I woke up the next morning. I was really remorseful, and I guess I had already texted them while drunk beginning them to forgive me, and that I was so sorry for the terrible thing I said. They were adamant that we would “talk later” about it, which I really think means the bridges are burned.

Anyway, these friends are married and one of them had a key to my safe that has a shotgun in it. I gave it to him because I didn’t trust myself. I have been trying to sell it for a while, so when I woke up that morning and still wanted to die, I texted him and asked if he could put it in his mailbox and I could pick it up. I think he assumed I just had a buyer, but in any case, he actually drove across down to deliver it (and another thing he had of mine) to my mailbox.

I was going to just end it but IDK, I broke down and called another friend (who isn’t as close to me) who talked me down and I ended up checking myself into a psychiatric hospital. They only kept me for one day, because I wasn’t honest about them about my plans and intent. I just told them I didn’t feel safe around myself. This was partially because I have no money, and I gather that even with insurance it costs about $1,000 a day to be hospitalized. I just wanted to be stabilized until the shotgun was gone.

The problem is, the wife is my emergency contact and medical power of attorney. My family is abusive, my brother joined a cult, which are other stories, and she agreed to this about two years ago. When I say we were as close as family, I really felt like we were, she was the closest thing to a sister I’ve ever had, and he came damn close to being a brother. So they called her, even after I told them not to. She calls me at the hospital and is very kind, wanting to watch my pets and telling me that she loves me and is scared for me. I tell her she can’t help me and to not be scared and that I’m sick and that my friend is taking care of the pets.

Once I was discharged friend and I sold my shotgun, and the suicidality was gone. The wife has continued to send me kind messages on messenger, I apologized for the hospital involving her, etc, she tells me that I’m not an imposition, and that they want to be there for me, etc.

But I know I’ve hurt them and I know the reason they are doing this is because they are good people and they feel it is their duty to preserve human life. They probably wouldn’t do this for a stranger, but I don’t imagine anymore that they like me as a person, or want to have a real friendship (or family?) with me anymore, just based on what transpired.

I go to the same gym as the husband and wife. It’s actually where we met. Wife doesn’t come a lot, husband does. I went today, to both classes, because it’s just so fucking lonely at home, even though I told myself I wouldn’t go to the session he goes to. I apologized to him in person, he said, “OK,” walked a few steps away and, “We will talk about it later.” As I turned to go he asked if I was OK, and I nodded.

I don’t want to interfere with his enjoyment of the gym, and he was so fake with me in the gym until we were face to face (like, we have a line up where we shake hands), that I know me being there must be a stressor. And I can’t take back what I said. I can’t normally go in the morning at all, only in the evening, when they go. And I’m trying to make the choice if I want to stay away from the gym for the next three months, so they can enjoy it in peace. They are moving in three months, so there’s that. But I this gym is the only thing that keeps me motivated to live, and there’s not another one like it in town, and even if there was, I’d be among strangers.

After college we moved our separate ways physically, him back with his parents and me independently. We’ve been semi long distance for 3 years  and I only see him about once a week for a few hours since we have to sneak around. 

Problem: my boyfriend is still financially dependent 100% on his parents. He is trying to look for a job but hasn’t had any luck. Because of this dependence, I feel like his parents control him and I’m growing resentful of them. For one, he has STILL not yet told his parents that I exist or that he’s dating someone. We’ve had many conversations about this and I get the cultural implications of it but it has been 4 years so I’m increasingly frustrated and growing impatient. I understand the beginning because of the no dating in Asian culture piece, but we’ve been very serious together for a couple of years now. Because his parents don’t know he’s dating, we have to sneak around. He can’t go out too often because he gets screamed at by his parents. When he does go out to see me he lies to them so he feels bad. We plan on telling them about us next month, but I’m scared he won’t stand up for me when/if they disapprove as he hasn’t shown he can yet. He’s afraid to stand up to them as he thinks they’ll kick him out and cut him off. Im afraid they’re never going to let him come over or see me. He convinced me to trust him that he will stand up to them when he makes money, but I find it so hard to trust and believe this. I’m 100% financially independent, have been for 3 years, and ready for the next step in our relationship. We talk about this and he is ready too mentally, but not ready because of his life instability. You can bet he can’t catch a break from them because of this instability. We’ve been stuck in this limbo for so long and we fight constantly about it because he doesn’t believe he’s being controlled and is frustrated being pulled all different ways. I try as hard as I can to be supportive but I feel I have cut him so much slack and am annoyed at our relationship since it’s so abnormal. He’s assured me time and time again that he would never accept an arranged marriage but you never know. 

Please offer any advice or similar experiences. I love him so deeply he’s so kind and funny and sweet, but this I feel this is ruining our relationship as my anger and resentment grows. I honestly don’t know if it’s worth staying anymore.

So we finally hung out at a burger place like two days ago and honestly I talked a lot about myself. He asked and got my last name, birthday, and like idk. He wanted to know about me and I kinda just gave in? He did talk about him but it felt like it was mostly about me. 

Secondly, even though it was our only encounter hanging out he did stand really close, but I didnt mind but then he would brush against me.

We were walking, and when he did brush against me or something he said he wantes to walk on one side of the sidewalk He kept switching. He always walked on the side of the sidewalk closet to the street? Ive never seen anyone constantly switching like that before. It could have been an excuse to brush against me but who knows. I have no idea how common that it.

The entire time it felt sorta off. It was somewhat akward sure, but other times its doesnt feel like idk.. kinda creepy?

Maybe its because I have this feeling he might kinda like me but I feel weird cuz I dont like him like that (if he does). 

The moment that really got me kinda creeped a little was that he sent me a facebook request. He never really said anything about adding eachother, he just said he swore he saw me on his reccomendations list of friends. I was confused on how the heck he would remember that but idk. 

So he basically asked my last name and searched it up on fb, and well I did add him since idk im nice I guess? He immediately texted me after and that was a bit more ehh. 

Im not really sure what to do at this point. I feel weirdness from him, but it feels weird to be all ""oh hey I get these odd vibes from you, I dont wanna hang out k bye"" after we hung out two days ago and this fb thing.

Idk how to summarize any of this, sorry about that. Kinda ranted since I wanted to write about it more in depth since its been on my mind a bit too much

 So heres just a general question though if you dont really wanna read anything 

TLDR; Is it a valid reason to stop hanging out with someone because you feel kinda weirded by them? If you do though how would you even tell them that? Or do you not tell them and just come up with excuses? ",relationships,[19f] Getting weird vibes after hanging out with a dude [20m]
