t2_2i4vkblw,1553862612.0,b6wnvu,t3_b6wnvu,242,"I recently ended an LTR after a long time. I’m doing well but have absolutely zero interest in dating right now.

My problem is that male friends that I have always had purely platonic relationships with seemingly think I’m fair game now?

For example, a male friend of mine who is also friends with my ex asked to come and hang out. We hang out frequently (admittedly not at my place), and I assumed this would be as normal. But when he got here he kept touching me, making bizarre uninvited sexual comments, and I had to be painfully distant to make him get the picture and leave.

A couple of dudes at work that I have casual friendships with have changed the way they interact with me slightly - making sexual jokes, asking how my love life is since the breakup etc.

Tomorrow I agreed to go to an event with a friend of mine on the basis that it’s a work do and there’s free booze. He mentioned in conversation that people can only bring long term partners, so I’ll have to pretend to be dating him if people ask? No thanks.

So my question is: Is this normal behaviour? How do I communicate clearly with these friends that I am in no way sexually attracted to them without being rude or presumptuous?

TL;DR - recently out of an LTR and suddenly a few platonic male friends are acting weird/flirty/sexual. I’m not into it and need tips on how to tell them I’m not interested without blatantly telling them to fuck off.",relationships,How do I (22F and recently single) set boundaries with male friends?
t2_3i3qr2aq,1553861421.0,b6whfu,t3_b6whfu,82,"I have dated my boyfriend for an over a year. We are extremely compatible and I see my future with him. However, he suffers from depression &amp; also is very stressed with balancing university and work together. 

Recently, his stress and depression has come up in the form of anger even when it's not about me. Yelling at me, hitting objects when angry, getting irritated easily and swearing. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells when we talk these days. It's like he became another person.

Today he called me because he couldn't come over to my house, so we chatted on the phone while he was playing video games but his voice seemed just as cold as it was yesterday. I had a bad pain in my stomach and I was still upset from the day before because he yelled at me, and I told him he can call me after playing his game. He assumed I was upset because of the game, and then we had an explosive fight that I am still shocked by. 

He said that I just want to fight, that I just want to break his mental health. He said that I've never helped him. He even threatened to block me when I was typing. He accused me of always pushing him away and said he's tired because I'm always upset when we call-- when actually the past few weeks the only reason I'd get upset is if he'd snap at me. And he even said I faked my stomach ache.

I am so lost. I've cried my eyes out because it's never what I intended. I've been trying to be understanding and supportive of him recently because I know he's having a hard time but it feels like he can't see how hard I am trying for him too. He told me he'll get better but refuses to get professional help. The worst part about this fight is that I can't tell if this his depression talking or if this is really how he feels about me, that I'm a fake evil person that is just simply trying to damage his mental health. Because he always talks about how much he loves me and how much I've helped him and given him strength, so I'm really confused about today.

I would really appreciate any advice. Am I a terrible person if I give up on this relationship? Did I cause him to be like this?  And what if he tries to harm himself if I leave? I'm so scared of this. Should I stay with him and try to be more understanding of his depression and not take it personally?

Well he usually tells me to be quiet but it's kind of like an inside joke. But jokingly I asked him ""whyyy"" and he said ""because I don't like it"" and when I asked him if he was being serious he said yes.

He said it makes him ""feel weird"" and he doesn't like it. I assured him that I compliment him because that's just how I feel. He replied with ""idk maybe I just don't like compliments"". 

Our relationship is fairly new. I know that this isn't going to create a ""bump"" because we went right back to joking around like normal after we discussed it a little more.

But why would someone feel that way about compliments? I know he was being serious about it. But now I'm just confused.

t2_27v8h11d,1553842057.0,b6tzku,t3_b6tzku,143,"Previously posted on JustNoSO. Advised that this is the place for it:

My (32F) SO (28M) is split between a JustYES and JustNo. His good side is wonderful and he can be so thoughtful and supportive.  The issue occurs whenever he is challenged, criticised in any way or asked to do anything to help (ie housework). 

He will go over the top to make sure whatever happened is my fault. This incident occurred over a month ago, but it still affects me and is making me question our relationship further. 

So, to paint a picture and provide context, I'm a law school graduate, but suffer crippling low confidence, anxiety and depression. I am under the care of a doctor and on medication. I'm awaiting therapy. My lack of confidence means that despite having an excellent degree, I work a dead-end, minimum wage job. This fact contributes to the state of my mental health. I feel lost. 

In an effort to combat this, I had waited a full year to apply to a graduate recruitment scheme, which I actually stood a really good chance of getting (between my skill set and education). I really wanted a shot at this. 

Part of the application was a maths based aptitude test. It was on the more difficult end of the scale and  maths isn't my strong point. Strictly timed and complex, I studied for it in advance. You only get one shot at this. Slipping up by a mere minute is enough to throw the test and therefore the whole application. 

It's pretty horrible. 

Anyway, to the JustNO moment in question. 

I take over the livingroom for the 20 minute assessment. I tell him what I'm doing. He knows all of the above. 

I close the door, set my laptop and notes up. I'm no more than 10 minutes in and he bursts in with the dog. The dog jumps up, he starts talking to me and the complex calculation I was in the middle of was lost. I shouted at him to get out (I went into a panic) and he huffed and puffed and went out the room. By the time he left, I had lost my train of thought and so much time on the assessment that my application was thrown. I broke down crying. 

Why did he interrupt knowing what I was doing? Because he was going to go to the gym and wanted to ""say goodbye"". 

I took a breath and tried to explain to him what had just happened. I told him I didn't blame him if he had forgotten what I was doing or the importance of it. That what happened had effectively thrown my application and I'd now need to wait another year. 

I told him I wasn't angry, but I was upset. 

His response is what concerns me: 

- he denied forgetting what I was doing when he burst in. 
- he stated that he ""had to"" interrupt me to say goodbye because I had (allegedly) implemented this huge rule that he has to say goodbye before he leaves the house or I'll turn into a rage beast (I pointed out that if be truly wanted to say goodbye he could have texted me. He said he ""wasn't doing that""). 
- if I couldn't handle the stress of his interruption then I couldn't have handled the job (the job wasn't maths related, and besides WTF)
- and my personal favourite ""Rosington2010, maybe you're not as clever as you think you are?"" 

(He was furious at me for shouting at him to leave the room when he had burst in. He ignored me for a significant part of the day). 

I'm still hurting over the last comment in particular. I can feel myself starting to resent him for it. 

I don't know what to do. I'm so vulnerable at the moment. 

Advice and perspective wanted. I can't talk to him because, well, of the way I know he will respond. This isn't an isolated incident. 

TL;DR: my SO knowingly interrupted an important application and, instead of apologising, twisted it round so it was my fault. He thinks I'm stupid and so his interruption didn't matter.

t2_ork7n,1553855884.0,b6vni9,t3_b6vni9,21,"Hi, my sister is 27, she moved back home two years ago after a having a baby broke up with her Ex. The dad, while far from perfect (no job, lives at home) is an ok person.

My sisters always been a bit angry, screaming matches at family *discussion*, stealing large amounts of money &gt;300$, selling items (loss of pretty much all my mums gold at once point.), fights over.... Nothing, constant deflections and redirections, when anything comes up and lately a increasing amount of resentment towards my mum, while simultaneously expecting my parents to be a second mother and father. 

Lately she's sits on her phone, completely zoned out of the world around her and her son who as a perfectly normal and kind of great 2 year old does a lot of 2 year old things. Climbing on tables, running etc, things that are fine... If they are supervised or  parented/stopped. 

Generally she will sit there on her phone until another parent jump in or wait until the very last second and scream. STOP . A comment made about this is met with screaming or beratement to my mum or deflection, really really irritating deflection and/or redirection. Like I cannot tell if she is stupid or a genius level of deflections for instance, she eats everything, every gift , every chip, every biscuit, every chocolate etc.

 Tonight she opened my mums gift and ate a large part of it.... When pulled up about it she managed to redirect the conversation into how dare someone found the rubbish and put it by her door, and try at make it out that I had somehow planned this to get her in trouble. Seems easy to argue right?  nope, not when you scream, burst into tears. My parents know its not true of course  but literally have no idea what to do but reiterate the point they were trying to make which leads to a feedback loop until one of them is too tired of the cycle and leaves or gives up. 

I mentioned money and gold before which In the grand scheme of things makes chocolate inconsequential but  the argument is exactly the same no matter what. Hell she gambled 565 dollars of my own money in app purchases, to which I have to push to a point of argument to get a small payment back after a year. Its shit, maybe 1-3 times a week, Food, dirty nappies being left around, money, asking to help with the dishes etc, literally becomes a point of contentment to the point of one-sided screaming, crying and frankly manipulation 

Like all people like this, when she is good she is good but its getting really painful around here. I need to move out but I just started graduate studies  (not really an excuse it needs to happen just  got get the money). 

The obvious answers…. kick her (or I leave but thats still leave my parents in a shitshow ) or get her therapy. BUT. HOW. what happens to her son. my parents don't know I am writing this, but they are literally at wits ends with her.

t2_x2o6w,1553873544.0,b6ypv3,t3_b6ypv3,10,"Some backstory: Basically my one little sister has a lying issue. She’s done this for as long as I can remember, and we all know about it. They moved far away like 3 years ago and until then, i was never super close with any of them. It was like a normal half sibling relationship i guess. We texted every couple of weeks and talked sometimes. I visited them for a couple weeks last summer and got really close with my other little sister (13. side note, but is it weird that i’m so close with her considering the age gap? part of me thinks it is but oh well.) and she became like one of my best friends, and that upset the older one that we didn’t hang out or talk that much. 

Since that vacay, i text the older one every couple of weeks and the other one like every other day. After i talk with the older one, i often have to talk with the younger one and have to fact check with her, since she’s always saying some dumb shit that i don’t know if it’s true.

I went down there last week and almost didn’t spend time with her again, but on the last night my other sister went to sleep early so i went to her room and we started talking. We talked for like 2 hours about some pretty serious stuff (her parents cheating, abuse, other relationships, and childhood trauma) and i tried putting the thought that anything she was saying could be a lie aside, but then i caught her in a stupid small lie and called her out for it, and that made me question everything else we talked about. After i got back, i talked to my grandma about her parents cheating and sx abuse when we were younger to see if it was true, and nope. Last night i talked to my other sister about it and other stuff too and again, no. The thought that she made all that terrible stuff up and I opened up and was honest with her just pisses me off. Maybe it’s my fault for trying to trust her. 

I was gonna text her this:

&gt;hey

&gt;so i’ve gotta be honest with you. why do you always lie and over-exaggerate stuff? like all the time. i tried to have a real conversation with you the last night i was there, and i tried putting the thought that you could be making it all up aside, but then i caught you in a lie, and after thinking about it, i’m pretty sure most of what you said isn’t true. you wondered why im closer with (other sister) and don’t talk to you as much and it’s because i can’t believe anything that comes out of your mouth. i love you dude but it really hurts not to be able to believe anything you say. you need to stop

but i really don’t want to hurt her or start any drama. should i just let her lie and forget about it? I want to have a closer relationship with her because i know it hurts her that we don’t, but it’s hard when i can’t believe what comes out of her mouth. I’m honestly fine with leaving our relationship as is.

(Me, black 21m) My GF (Mostly European, 21F) has a thing for black guys. I’m use to this, and it’s been common in a few of my relationships. (I’ve been more or less fetishized before, and makes me wonder if thats how she thinks of me) We have been dating for 15+ months, and I didn’t really think about it as much till now. All of her pst EX’s were brown/black, her porn history is FILLED with interracial porn, when we are relaxing/chilling around I sometimes see her watching videos of shirtless black guys (all muscular ofc) and I told her it bothers me sometimes, she incorporates our color in the bedroom/dirty talk. 

Now recently, my girlfriend doesn’t have ANY friends, as in, I’m the only one she talks to at all. I noticed she had a few black “friends” from high school that she just watches their stories and never talks to them, (sometimes posting shirtless videos of themselves etc etc) she says she just watches their stories to keep up with their lives, but kind of just thinking this is bullshit. (They don’t really post anything about their lives in the stories, just what they’re doing, or talking about random stuff) am I overreacting? It’s sort of getting to the point where it bothers me that that’s what she’s looking at all of the time (which is fine if that’s what she likes, not saying she shouldn’t be doing that, just makes me uncomfortable) 

TL;DR girlfriend has a “liking” for African American guys (which I am) and it’s starting to bother me. 

Edit: here is a specific example of what I mean.

Girlfriend and I were going through our phones you know deleting old people, ex’s numbers stuff we didn’t need. 

As we are going through her snapchat friends list there are multiple black and white guys, she had no problem deleting any of the white guys, but SPECIFICALLY would not delete the black ones, and said it was because she liked keeping up with their lives (none of them talk at all, and I have verified) that was just something that was cause for concern.

t2_3i3vzvir,1553862347.0,b6wmhu,t3_b6wmhu,42,"TL;DR: My girlfriend will tell me I'm doing something wrong/doesn't like something I'm doing. I change my ways. Years later she will randomly change her mind, say not to pay attention to what she said before since she's a different person now. I can't seem to get over what she said in the first place so I still do it my changed way. I also don't know what things she has changed her mind on and what she hasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I have been together for  4ish years and moved in together after 10 months. Over the first couple of years, she would tell me things that she liked and disliked – things you learn about someone when you’re living together or just around each other for a while. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of these can be small things such as: How to open a can (there’s apparently a wrong and right way?), a jumper or shirt that she doesn’t like on me, the way I have my computer icons set up, how I wore my socks… There are way more, but of course now that I’m writing this post I can’t remember them!

&amp;#x200B;

I changed my actions so that I did things the way she wanted me to do them (because honestly, the way she said it made me feel like an idiot for doing it my way in the first place). What annoys me is that now, a couple of years later, these things will come up again. She asks me why I did something ABC and I’ll respond with “Because 2 years ago you told me that you didn’t like it when I did XYZ”. And she will say “Oh, I was a different person back then! You can totally do it now haha don’t you know me??”. She never told me that she changed her mind! How was I supposed to know?? And the thing is, she doesn’t even remember telling me that she didn’t like it in the first place!

&amp;#x200B;

While this is annoying, it becomes more of an issue to me when it comes to some bigger examples.

I used to play the guitar and sing in my free time. Back in the first few months of our relationship, I’d still occasionally pick up a guitar and play while she was around (usually if she was in the shower or playing video games by herself). Every single time she’d make a comment about how my voice was too high, she didn’t like the genre I played, I could be doing something else instead of playing the guitar, etc. So now my finger callouses are gone, my guitar collects dust in the corner. Then, starting a few months ago she’d occasionally ask “Hey, why don’t you play guitar anymore?”. !#$#% How do I then explain that she pretty much told me that she didn’t want to play, I lost my drive, and that’s why I can now barely bust out a C chord! Is this one of those things that she randomly changed her mind about and didn’t tell me? I still don't play the guitar because I keep thinking about the times where she told me she didn't like me playing.

&amp;#x200B;

A really big issue we have is that right from the beginning my girlfriend has hated my best friend. He is back home in Canada so in the last 4 years I haven’t even seen him in person. My girlfriend has never met him, seen him, or talked to him. (the reason she hates him is because she thinks he’s in love with me. He’s gay, I’m bi so it’s possible but highly improbable). We used to Skype once a month or so, but my girlfriend put a shut down to that quickly. Eventually it got to the point that I was to cut all contact with him. So I went about a year of not talking to my best friend at all. Birthdays, Christmases, family deaths went by without my best friend and it sucked. He did get back in contact with me (through email, since he was blocked on my phone) and I… didn’t tell my girlfriend right away. She did eventually find out (because she periodically asks me if I’m in contact with Geoff and I didn’t want to lie) and a HUGE argument ensued. By the end of it though, she told me that she has no issue with me talking to him but I shouldn’t have lied. But she said it in a way that it was obvious that she had big issues with it and she even said that she still hates him. So based on her past actions, this could be one of those things that she said she didn’t like in the past, randomly changed her mind, and is now ok with me doing. But I’m still scared of talking to him in case my girlfriend sees and finds something to get upset over.

t2_3i45h3x7,1553867825.0,b6xl0z,t3_b6xl0z,15,"Throwaway because I'm a mess of feelings.

I've been dating this guy for about 6 months, and so far it's been great. We share a lot of the same interests, although our specific tastes are slightly different (general rule is I'm more high fantasy, he's more low fantasy) so it's a combination of stuff that ends up with us bouncing things off of one another and kind of learning about the details of stuff we're vaguely aware of but not as knowledgeable as the other about. We've already dropped the l-bomb and while we usually at least made a day a week to go out, that's been falling by the wayside due to us getting super sick one after another. We don't live together, he lives in an apartment a few cities over, and I live with my parents.

My issue is I feel like I'm too unstable to be in a relationship now? Not just emotionally, although that doesn't hurt. In December, I got fired from my job for entirely just reasons because I slept through the first 20 minutes of my shift and I was one of two people who do my job, which means it's incredibly likely my boss had to take my place and it slowed stuff down significantly. 

Since then, I occasionally act like I've gotten stuff together to put in job applications but... There's something about the process that's been incredibly offputting to me, not in the ""I don't want to do this, bluh"" way, but in the actively ""I look at this and I start stressing out"" way. I've been mostly transparent about this (although I have said I'd send stuff in when I wasn't), and for the most part, he's chill enough and enjoys my company enough that he's still willing to take me out and have me over. He does give me guff about not putting in enough work for getting work, and I have no reason to disagree with him. It's especially bad on my part because I help run a few shows here and there in the area, and I've GOTTEN connections from the venues they're at (literally, gotten the head of security at one place openly just go ""put in an application here and I'll try and make it a sure thing""), but the act of filling out the online applications is just way more draining and stressful than it should be for any normal person.

I've been considering getting in contact with a doctor or some other kind of medical professional (I have no idea how the system works) to see if I can find out whether or not I have legitimate life-stalling depression (or something else fun, depression runs in the family but apparently I got tested for like everything when I was too little to remember and was borderline everything) or if I'm just a lazy piece of shit, but I'm trying to avoid setting up as many appointments as possible because there's no money coming in and I wanna wait until I get my physical in April to bring it up, which means a pretty long(ish) waiting game for something I may just be clinging to as an excuse, and it'll probably still be a while even if I'm put into counseling/medication for there to be anything concrete that comes of that that helps me get shit together.

All this aside, I know I'm going to get even worse emotionally because I've got a moderately big local competition coming up (moderately big as in I'm spending roughly $200 to make sure I'm competitive, but nothing that'll get me famous or anything dumb like that) which stresses me out a lot by itself, not considering that this year there's a few new contenders who are actually experienced with this kind of competition and I have to essentially be perfect to win. And I really want to win because last year I barely wasn't the runner up because someone cheated (like legitimately, one of the organizers told me that one of the judges gave the runner up a perfect score and a little more than half that to everyone else) and I keep feeling too close to winning. I'm kind of competitive as a person and I know I'm gonna procrastinate on shit which means I'm going to have like two weeks to put everything together and that's going to drive me insane.

I also have a lot of unaddressed issues with former relationships, in that almost every one I was the one broken up with and most of them were because cheating, which means I get irrationally concerned about fidelity and security. I sometimes feel like I just sent The One Message That Will Make Him Realize I'm Annoying, and kind of spiral down until conversation continues again, and my mind wanders really fast in the other direction (marriage, kids, etc) which means I kind of go to really strong places emotionally all the time. I recognize they're unhealthy places and I try to actively combat those thoughts, but they still happen and I still end up crying a lot at stuff that isn't the end of it all because I entirely feel like it is.

My boyfriend is working in his career, has a degree and is considering going back at some point for a masters, goes to the gym and tries to eat healthy, and is living a fairly successful life aside from occasionally impulse buying nerd stuff (which is relatable), and I feel like he deserves better than a college dropout without a job who's overemotional on the best of days. The idea of it really truely genuinely hurts, but I think I'm not in a place where I can be a good boyfriend to him, and every time I attempt to be a good boyfriend I overshoot like it's an episode of I Love Lucy. I feel like if I walk away I might not be able to walk back, and I've been making more efforts to improve myself (which is why I'm even thinking about this) but I don't know what the future holds. I love him and the idea of walking away from him sounds awful, but what can I do?

My boyfriend lives in a 3 bedroom apartment with his good guy friend and there’s a third bedroom for a roommate. About 8 months ago my boyfriend’s really nice female roommate, let’s call her Alana, who had the 3rd bedroom, had to move out. She was great, I really liked her so this sucks.

They found a new roommate, Natalie. From the beginning, I had a funny feeling about Natalie. My boyfriend talked about her a lot and showed me a pic of her (she’s pretty). I almost immediately got the vibe that he was much more interested in her as a person and possibly was attracted to her. She's very much 'his type'. Anyway, I ignored my feelings.

Then it was Natalie’s birthday and she was upset because the guy she was seeing flaked on their plans, so she was alone on her birthday. My boyfriend went out and bought her a cake and a card. This made me really upset, because on the first birthday he and I were together he didn’t get me anything, let alone a cake and a card - and he had known Natalie for about 5 minutes, and she isn’t his girlfriend!

Other than that, she’s always hanging around my boyfriend, both inside and outside the apartment and I just get the sense that she has no boundaries and she’s over friendly with him. When he calls me, she often tries to take his attention away by speaking to him when he’s on the phone so she’s almost a third person in our conversation. It’s incredibly irritating and it’s happened so many times that he has to go outside his apartment to call me because otherwise she joins in!

My boyfriend has loads of friends, both female and male and I think most of them are great. I don’t have a problem with him having female friends at all - his are lovely.

I met one of my best friends about a year ago on Tinder. We quickly hit it off an had a sort of summer fling before calling it quits because I was heading back to school. We were no-contact for a few weeks before he reappeared and we started a really wholesome, comfy friendship. Now, you're probably thinking I'm batshit insane for considering someone I've known for less than a year a best friend. I had a marginally fucked up childhood and have moved 20+, so I've learned to find my people quickly.

By the time he reappeared, I had lost all romantic feelings for him. Our relationship was entirely platonic and non-sexual until October, when we started some flirty banter and the occasional ass pic. It was never heading towards a relationship, I didn't want it to, and it gassed me up and gave me the confidence to pursue a few people I otherwise would not have. Pretty harmless.

Things changed in November. About a week before Thanksgiving, I got a text saying, ""I wish I got you choke you more"" from him. That sparked a pretty dirty run of sexting, nudes, yadayada that lasted until mid-December. We had made plans to hookup again and I was pretty excited, as we're fairly sexually compatible, he made me feel comfortable, and I have a lot of sex-based anxiety due to past traumatic events.

Despite the fact that things had gotten really spicy, it was always second player to our friendship. It was fun and hot, but nothing important to me. That's why I was floored when he ghosted me a few days before Christmas. Blocked on everything, no texts back, disappeared off the face of the planet. A few nights prior to this, we had a lengthy discussion about how he was miserable and never believed he'd be happy. I was extremely worried as I assumed something bad had happened due to that prior conversation. It also hurt like a mf to lose someone that was such a regular part of my life.

He came back in January and apologized. He told me he had started a relationship with another girl right when he ghosted me, which is why he did it. I wasn't happy but I understood the decision he made and chose to move on from it, because I genuinely do love him to death. Things were great, too. He seemed a lot healthier and spoke when things bothered him, I was happy he found a girl that made him enjoy life more, and I was starting to make more friends (I moved back home and switched schools in December, so we are now living in the same town). I had found a sense of community and inclusion I haven't had since I was 12.

Then things started to unravel. I was going to move into a pretty big house with him and four/five other guys. We found a house and were days away from signing a lease when his girlfriend found out about me. It turns out that he had never disclosed the past nature of our relationship to her, even though he told me she knew. This caused a breakdown in communication which resulted in more information coming out. It turns out they started dating immediately after we stopped seeing each other, and that he had been cheating on her for a large chunk of their relationship. With me. He had lied to me stating that they began dating towards the very end of our involvement in December. He also gaslit the fuck out of her and convinced her she was crazy for ever believing there was something between us.

Needless to say, I told her as I believe she deserves to know. They haven't broken up and I didn't think they would. I am miserable, though. I did everything right after he ghosted me to build this friendship back and it worked! Until it didn't. He told me he's seeking professional help to get better and do better and we agreed to end contact. But I don't want this to be a permanent thing. He meant a lot to me when he was the worst, and I want to know him as a better and healthier person. I would give up peanut butter for a month to just be able to talk to him about what happened. Am I fucking insane? Is there any chance of reconciliation or do I just accept that we are now and always will be strangers.

My gf and I had been dating for 1 year and 3 months and broke up the day after my birthday


We were in an argument the day before my birthday on the 27th and it ended badly. The argument involved her beginning to hang out with other people and spending less time with me. This was our first major argument and I never expected it to erupt into something so much worse. On the 28th she breaks up with through a 5 min phone call and tells me that we weren’t the right people for each other and that she hasn’t felt like she’s loved me for a couple months now

At no point in time did I see any indication that our relationship was in turmoil and I never would’ve thought in a million years that she would end it like this. I tell her that it’s unfair of her to break up with me without giving me a chance to do anything. She tells me that she’s given our relationship many chances, but how could she have ever given it any chances without telling me what went wrong? I also tell her that there are 2 people in a relationship and that it’s unfair to end it so one sided. I offer to give her space and that her decision is rash but she says that her decision is final and that it’s her life and she gets to decide what she does with it. I just don’t see how after over a year she now decides that we aren’t the right people for each other. She’s been making plenty of new friends lately and I have a terrible feeling that she’s maybe met someone else. 

I’m so confused about this whole situation and want to mend things but it’s so hard when someone says they do not love you anymore without and indication telling me why she doesn’t. 

She is also diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder and a couple of other things that have been known to change her mood so it could be a possibility that she’s potentially having some sort of episode

t2_1t87m3bf,1553855645.0,b6vmb0,t3_b6vmb0,26,"Okay, I apologise in advance for how long this post is. There is a TL;DR at the bottom.
So I was raised by a single parent, my mum, until the age of 10 when she met my step dad, let’s call him Steve. 


Me and Steve have had a very confusing relationship since then. It has basically consisted of Steve getting annoyed at me for a very small reason- something like me moaning about having to walk the dog (bearing in mind I was a teenager), putting my dish on the side and not washing up that and the others that are there, not feeding the cats in time etc. 
He would then have a sort of ‘strop’ at me, ignoring me for days, once it even lasted for two weeks, until I finally give in and apologise (often I wasn’t even sure what for). Once I apologised, he would then have to spend a good few hours talking to me and explaining what I did wrong. I mean hours here. It ended up feeling like it was him telling me everything that was wrong with me, often calling me selfish, immature, rude, etc. This really did affect me, but if I ever got annoyed and defended myself it would just prolong the argument. So I usually just tried my best to bite my tongue and listen to him telling me for hours how and why I was a terrible person. Though there were plenty of times I couldn’t and did argue back. 

Don’t get me wrong my mum originally used to stand up for me, but it would just cause a longer, full blown argument so like me, she just bit her tongue.


Fast forward to now- I moved out to university 3 years ago, and last year my mum, step dad and little brother (my half brother) moved to Spain. This fucked me up big time and I got depressed. I really wasn’t my usual self. It resulted in me and Steve actually arguing less because any time he had a go at me I just couldn’t deal with it. I would cry and feel empty, to the point where even Steve felt bad about it.


Anyway, nowadays I’m feeling a lot better and I’m back to my normal self. However, whenever I go home I am treated exactly the same as I was before I moved out. Attacked for doing minor things.


So his latest ‘strop’ is because of an incident last time I came to visit, which was last week. I had flown in at 3am so I was knackered, and went to have a nap and told my mum I would help her cook tea when I woke up. I ended up over sleeping by an hour and when I came downstairs my mum has already done the prep and was cooking tea. Not much I could do, so I obviously apologised and I made the rice. (Bear in mind Steve was watching TV with my brother at this point). After we ate I did the washing up. 
I took my little brother to bed and came downstairs to find just my mum. Steve has gone to bed without saying night to me, telling mum that he was going to bed so that he didn’t start an argument. So me and mum spent the rest of the night trying to figure out what I had done this time to offend him. We’re assuming it must have been the fact I over slept and so didn’t help as much as I said I would with tea.


For the rest of the week I was there he didn’t really speak to me much, I’m used to this so I ignored it and carried on with my time there. I’m home now and I’m organising the flights to go back and see them in summer. Today he asked mum to tell me to come after his birthday, ( meaning I can’t pick the cheaper flights I was going to go for ) because he “doesn’t want an argument”.  It is literally the ‘adult’ equivalent of “you’re not invited to my birthday party”. My mum says he felt like I hadn’t spoken to him the whole time I was there and that’s why he’s annoyed. Just to clarify- he had been funny with me the entire time after the going-bed-early incident.


How do I deal with this man? He really does love and care for me- he worked his ass off for a month before I came so that my room was insulated as I was cold last time. But then I get there and he treats me like shit?


I am really at a loss here and I’m teetering on just giving up with him. That’s not what I want because I love my mum and brother so much and I want to be able to go and visit them without there being drama with Steve.


Any advice would be welcome.




TL;DR- my stepdad still treats me like a child when I come home to visit (despite moving out 3 years ago) and it’s really making it impossible to go home. I want to see my mum and little brother. How do I deal with this situation?



Edit: just a quick edit, I want to make it clear that my step dad doesn’t really realise what he’s doing. I’ve explained it to him many times but he physically cannot see it from another perspective. I understand why a few people have said it is emotional abuse- but I just want to make it clear that he isn’t intentionally being emotionally abusive. I know that doesn’t justify it, but in his head he just doesn’t see it that way.


Also my mum tries her best to help in these situations but she’s been defending me for years, so all Steve sees now is us ganging up against him, which makes the situation worse if anything.

But thank you so much for your replies - it’s so helpful to get an outside perspective! 

Edit 2: sorry I completely forgot to mention this pretty important detail- my mum and Steve did go to couples counselling and the counsellor said she felt Steve may be autistic. He didn’t want to go any further with this so hasn’t been officially diagnosed, but it does explain a lot.",relationships,How do I (21F) deal with my step father (41M)?

\*Edited for clarity\*

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone!

I\[F30\] am in a super bizarre situation and could use some advice.  As of early this morning my long-distance boyfriend\[M38\] of 6 months is now a dad.   He and his ex girlfriend\[F37\] split up last June (\*\*Edit for clarity \*\* they dated for a year, broke up, sort of dated, he broke up with her again, she now lives 1.5 hrs from him. Separately, he is divorced 3 years from his ex-wife who he was with for 8 years. also, I ended a 10 yr relationship with my ex boyfriend in June.) , He and I started dating in September, ex-girlfriend told him she was pregnant in December and he didn't tell me till February.  Now baby is here.

They weren't and haven't really been in contact till now and do have a co-parenting plan set out but he does seem to think they will be able to do it without a Custody Order or anything (I've told him that literally everyone I know says its super important but its not my decision).

He has a plan for staying near by during his paternity leave, gonna see the baby a few hours every day after that (ex lives near where he works).  He and I talked about it.  Realistically his and my schedule isn't going to change much. We see each other every few weeks as is.  He's (supposed) to go on a 5 day trip with me at the end of next month.

The relationship itself has been really good.  He and I have a lot of shared goals/life visions, we get along well, we can (mostly) talk about hard issues etc., he treats me really well, is kind, sex is good, and we've started having conversations about what next steps, moving forward, looks like. (\*\*Edit for clarity - we've both spent time at each others houses, I have met/know friends, neighbors, family, work colleagues etc and vice versa.\*\*)  It is really exciting but also kind of scary to find someone that you could actually see spending your life with and he's said that multiple times.  We both want kids, soonish (both of us in the last 3 years broke up with long term partners that didn't want kids), which we'd talked about even before he told me that &lt;surprise&gt; he sort of had/was gonna have one.

He was really upset when he told me because he was really worried I would take off and not want to see him any more.  Which is totally fair. He should have told me way sooner but there was some other stuff that happened (his dad had a heart attack, I had work travel etc.) and we didn't get to see/connect with each other at all January-early Feb.

I was a bit of a mess for a few days, we talked about all sorts of things, but the biggest thing that bothered me. and does now. is that his ex does not know he has a girlfriend.  He didn't want to tell her right before she gave birth (which I get), and it did take me a few weeks to sort out how I felt about the situation and if I was gonna be able to stick around.

Unfortunately time-wise, that put him/us 2 weeks before the due date. So he decided not to tell her even though I told him repeatedly if I was her I would want to know upfront. Not my call, I don't know her(obviously)  Welp, new baby decided to wait week and a half beyond due date, so it's been almost a month now.   And at this point, I can't imagine he'll tell her for a while when she's recovering/not sleeping. So when he does tell her, it will be ""oh by the way I have a serious girlfriend of 7 months."" which is kind of fucked up in itself and I actually feel kind of pissed/protective of her even in this situation. GAH.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways. He and I did get to see each other last time a week ago when I was up for work. It was really lovely but we didn't really get into talking about all of this because we were in the waiting period.  He wants me involved in his/the baby's life, he wants to have more kids, he says he wants all these things. and if the girl is indeed as laid-back and ok with the situation as he says, it could all I think actually happen that way. As far as step-parenting its actually the best case scenario where the baby will never know something other than that. But that's a huge unknown for me. I just have to trust him on it. \*WHICH is hard in a new relationship to begin with. Especially since he lied by omission for the 2 months before he told me. Other than that he's been totally there for everything though. I'm just a little confused how to/how much to believe him on things right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless. Baby is here now. She's healthy. He is SO excited. I'm super excited for him.  BUT the fact that his ex doesn't know is making me feel like so much shit.  I thought I was good but I'm really really upset.   I think it's because I'm feeling really upset that this person I care about, who says he loves me, made a decision (to not tell her), that is making this situation a lot harder for me.   I'm feeling kind of disrespected I think too, we talked about this multiple times, and he said he'd think about it and definitely let me know if he did tell her. But that was kind of it.    I'm perhaps also feeling resentful that he is so happy and excited and having this time with her, even though its just as a co-parent, and that his decision to do that is making me feel so lonely and not important to him.    And I have kind of felt like throwing up all day which is just great.

&amp;#x200B;

I just am having a really hard time and don't really know how to respond/what to do.  He's been texting me regularly about updates and how beautiful his daughter is etc. but he's also totally wrapped up and hasn't asked how I am. And if he does, I'm not quite sure what to say.

""Excited for you but really shitty because of your decisions thanks.""?    There are relationship blogs, and long distance blogs, and step mom blogs. But no, I'm actively dating someone who is having a newborn with their ex who also lives 4 hours away blogs and I'm frankly not sure what the guidebook is for how to even act in this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, because I know someone will ask, I don't know if he's going to get a paternity test. I asked him about it in an email right after he told me with a lot of other stuff in it and we never talked about it.  I am also not really sure how to ask him about it. Especially now that the baby has been born. I'm assuming he did, I know it's often standard procedure for un-wedded parents. but he really values people's word and I could see him not doing it out of pride or something.   I guess I've been thinking that if indeed this is a good relationship, if he is trustworthy, I need to trust him that he's made the right decisions and not nag. But also, how the heck do you ask someone who's in love with a new baby if he's sure it's his?

First and only time anything like this has ever happened to me, but things like “once a cheater always a cheater” have me pretty much freaking out inside on a daily basis.

So my longtime boyfriend and I have been dating on and off since we were 16, and have been through a lot together. Definitely a situation where we are watching one another grow up, with all of the twists and turns and rises and falls that that process entails. In October, November, December of 2018, his depression that has been a large challenge for both of us intensified greatly, and he became extremely outwardly pessimistic and negative about everything. (Small example—he has a warranty on his iPhone. It started malfunctioning. He told me about the answers with an attitude that was essentially like, “Whoop-dee-doo, yet another reason my life is straight trash, add another L to the pile.” I suggested he bring his phone to the Apple Store to get the warranty honored, he brushed me off and said “Why bother, they won’t even honor it. All those people are scam artists anyway.”) He lost any motivation to get up and help himself, and instead was letting his work and social lives collapse while talking about how he was cursed and just not destined for success, and that his dreams would never come true.

It was a lot for me to bear. I had just lost my mother after a short battle with brain cancer in September, and was trying to break through the extremely traumatic anguish and and anxiety attacks I had experienced throughout her treatment. I threw myself into work and friendships, and things really did start getting better, except in my relationship, in which I was essentially a fixer and a caretaker. I was the one who took the phone to the Apple Store, and other small things like that really began to pile up on me. He refused to come out and meet my friends, and began belittling me for “spending all of my time at a bar” (I work at a bar. I have never struggled with alcoholism or any other addiction issue, it was just a familiar physical space full of people I know, who had really helped me through things while I was helping him). 

He also latched on to this strong hatred of a particular male coworker, who he said was “definitely into me” and “I bet you like him more than you like me” and “I just knew it, I’m so boring and unintelligent to you, you talk about your real interests and passions with that guy and I’m just a friend you fuck”—the dude was a former Navy officer and USNA employ, was interested in military history (my college major) and books, we would chat about those things throughout the shift. My boyfriend really would not let it go though, and was constantly hammering into me trying to get me to admit that I thought he was “too boring, uninteresting, unintelligent.” He had become really convinced of those specific things for some reason, and I disagree with all of them. I think he’s a thoughtful, bright, brilliant person with a science-oriented mind that mystifies and excites me. We don’t have the same interests, but learning new things is one of my biggest passions, and he always has something interesting and perspective-changing to offer in a conversation, as opposed to the same old shit about Thucydides I’ve heard a thousand times.

I tried to tell him this and more, but he wouldn’t listen to me. I started to feel resentful, put-off, I don’t want to say disgusted but just extremely frustrated and disappointed. I know that depression is an illness and he was not well, I still feel a lot of guilt about those emotions. At the end of November I attempted to seriously break up with him. I laid down all of my honest feelings as to why the relationship was not right for me, but he was so upset and... I folded. We stayed together, except that I had mentally checked out. Two weeks after that things continued to be really painful and negative, I continued to feel unheard. And walking to my car at the end of the night, that same coworker that my boyfriend initially mistrusted took my hand, and I found myself holding his back. I will never forgive myself for that. I did break up with BF promptly, and he had been sending me pretty manipulative texts all night, so I felt ready inside. I was just done.

Two weeks after that I slept with my coworker. It was the end of December. I found out he had a girlfriend/an LDR. Still, while he had just slept with me. I was shocked, and told him he needed to break up with her, and that it wasn’t fair that he had done that to her. After I had just held someone else’s hand while still in a relationship. I feel so mixed up and confused about this time. I wish I had reacted more strongly, and kicked him to the curb, but I didn’t. I felt like he genuinely cared about me, and fucked up as it is I think he actually did. But for me, I knew I could never feel romantic attraction towards him, especially knowing he had physically cheated like that, but
mostly because, he wasn’t my ex. (...) I ended up cutting all ties with him. This was such a messy and shameful episode in my life.

A month after that, my boyfriend reached out. He had quit the job that was making him miserable and found a new one that he liked. Had enrolled for the Spring semester and started taking classes again. He said he was sorry, and that he missed me and loved me, and was seeking help and didn’t know how things had ever gotten so bad. I love him more than anything, and we got back together. I immediately began having extreme anxiety daily about my fling with my coworker, which in my mind has become an affair and full blown cheating on my boyfriend, even though we were broken up. I told him about the sex right away. He essentially said “I told you so,” but moved on with an ease and forgiveness that shocked me. He still doesn’t know about the night I held that guy’s hand. And now I wonder if cheating is programmed into me, like I don’t react to things that clearly aren’t okay, like coworker holding my hand, the right way. Like what if I have wandering eyes forever, what if it happens again. I feel extreme worry towards the future because I don’t know what will happen, who I will meet, how I will feel or act. I feel extreme guilt about what happened and never, ever want to do anything like that again. But it’s like I don’t trust myself to act on my own morals anymore.

t2_3i2yeu6l,1553853999.0,b6veiu,t3_b6veiu,25,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months and we live together. We're very close and have shared a lot of fun and tough moments already. I usually feel pretty solid in our relationship, but his lack of affection is starting to affect my self-esteem. He gives casual hugs and 'I love you's often, but the more serious types of affection I'd expect to see by now just aren't there.

Sexually, his libido is just not as strong as mine. I don't mind initiating sex most of the time or taking care of myself when he's not feeling it. But when we do have sex, his eyes are always closed. He NEVER looks at me during sex. He very rarely gives oral sex or gives me external stimulation. Don't get me wrong, the sex is still good and he seems to really care about getting me off, but it's not as great as it could be. It makes me feel like he's not attracted to me or very invested emotionally. He also never gives any kind of compliments about my appearance. He's the only person I've ever been with that doesn't.

I, on the other hand, am extremely affectionate. I tell him I'm in love with him often, and it's very true. I'm head over heels in love. He's honest, supportive, crazy smart, and treats my kids like gold. He also happens to be the most attractive man I've ever met in my life. Sexy, handsome, beautiful. I find myself just staring at his face sometimes because I can't believe I got so lucky.

I do everything I can to communicate all of this. I compliment his appearance and personality traits all the time. I thank him for everything he does. I try to take care of him as best I can. I give him oral sex pretty often. None of these things ever seem to get returned, and I have no clue why. I've asked him about it a few times before, but the only answer I get is that he does love me and does find me attractive, but it's always said matter-of-factly. It makes me wonder if he's in this relationship for companionship rather than a desire for me as a person. He was very lonely and depressed before we got together.

I KNOW we need to communicate better, and I'm trying to prepare for a serious talk about it. I don't want to upset him or just have my concerns brushed off again. I see 4 possible scenarios, and I have no clue which one is most likely to be true.

1. He loves me in every way and I'm just having self-esteem issues.

2. He loves me in every way, but has some kind of issue that's stopping him from expressing it.

3. He loves me, but is just not very attracted to me. :(

4. He is not as emotionally invested in this relationship as I thought. :(

Have you ever had similar issues in a relationship, and if so, do you know the reason behind it? How would you suggest raising these issues in a loving, supportive way? Or, am I simply reading too much into it and this is just who he is?

TL;DR - My boyfriend doesn't initiate or look at me during sex, compliment my appearance, give me much physical affection, or speak affection outside of the phrase 'I love you.' I'm worried that he doesn't love me on a serious level and doesn't find me attractive.",relationships,My (33F) boyfriend's (31M) lack of affection is getting to me
t2_34yrj78b,1553876321.0,b6z9r0,t3_b6z9r0,13,"Dear world:

**tl;dr**: My husband and I have a six-month-old baby girl. I need to decide if a divorce is right or wrong for her well-being. What is better? This relationship or growing up with divorced parents, a potentially messy co-parenting situation or a single mama? I need help, I am completely lost, frightened and alone.

Let me start by telling you the good: My husband and I share values, interests and passions. We enjoy spending time together. I’m attracted to him. I admire his strength and drive. He makes me feel safe in the world. We share a history of 10 years. A lot of memories, a lot of good times. We built an amazing life together. Fulfilling careers, financial stability, a house we want to remodel, a community. We have lots of dreams for the future as a family and dreams beyond that time. He supports me. He wants me to succeed and he’ll do almost anything to make me happy. If I want to go somewhere or do something or need help with a something, he’ll make that thing his own and help, happily investing any amount of resources in whatever I need. He is incredibly generous to me and everyone else. We have loved becoming parents. He was incredibly supportive during my pregnancy and the delivery of our baby. He fell head over heals in love with his little baby girl. I can see his heart and soul light up when he sees her and holds her and tends to her. He has also been an incredible partner to me as a new mama. He has mostly taken my guidance how to parent our daughter, and has supported me in the ideas I have suggested. He has picked up work around the house to make sure I can use the baby’s nap times to work, and he has put finances in place to make sure her and I are safe no matter what happens to him.

And here is the bad and ugly:

I will remember the first incident clearly until the day I die. We had just started dating, we were in a state of complete bliss. We went out for a walk one night to just look at the stars and he said: Mexico is the biggest country by surface. And I said, all little girl, head-over-heals in love, admiring all of his knowledge and experience and strength and everything else about him: No. Mexico? Really? I said it in a tone of admiration, like, really? Tell me more. You are so smart, you know so much. And he flipped the lid. He screamed at me: What the fuck is wrong with you, you’re just like all the others, why does nobody believe me, why does everybody doubt what I say. I recognized pain that had nothing to do with me. So I stood still in complete shock for a second and then reached out to gently take his hand. He harshly slapped it away and stormed off. (He had been to a meeting earlier where he had expected to be offered a job, but hadn’t.) He came to my apartment the next day, smiled at me and hugged me, and never mentioned the incident again.

And here are recent incidents since our daughter was born:

He has a pond in the yard with fish in it. One morning he went outside, I was in the kitchen with the baby. I heard him scream: Noooooo! and he came storming into the kitchen and said, aggressively: Did you turn off the pond protection device?!?! All the fish are gone. I said very calmly, no I didn’t, retreating, afraid of what would come next. That can’t be he kept going, aggressively ranting, all the fish gone, all of them. Go outside and look. That can’t be, you must have turned it off. And then I remembered that I actually HAD turned it off and not back on the day before and I said: Oh wait. Shit! I DID turn it off. Oh no. And then he really turned it up. What is so hard about remembering to turn it back on, look at what you did, all the fish gone, what do you want to do now, how do you want to fix this. I quietly picked up the baby and left the room, saying please, not around the baby. He followed me around the house to keep, not screaming, but heatedly and aggressively blaming me and demanding answers and apologies while I kept saying, please, not around the baby. When I talked to him about this, he said that I misunderstood. Proof for this being a misunderstanding is that he didn’t care about the fish at all, and that I should have just answered his questions and that my walking away was aggressive and triggered him further.

The next one was a huge blowup just a few weeks later. I triggered him. I made the first mistake here. I know that. I asked him to get me a swaddle from the dryer while I put the baby to sleep and he left and didn’t come back and it was a stressful situation and I was mad, so I just stomped past him in the kitchen and got it myself. He did not deserve that. He didn’t. Hands! Down! He completely lost his shit. He screamed and yelled insults at me completely out of control as a result. I ran in the bedroom, quietly and quickly closed the doors and turned on the white noise machines and I pray to God that it was fast enough, that I'm mistaken and our baby didn’t yet understand. I came out of the bedroom when the baby was asleep and confronted him. Scared as shit, I said: Have you lost your mind? You have got to be kidding me. The baby heard that! I came into the room and she was wide-eyed, stiff as a board. And he lost it. He screamed like an animal. I asked for a conversation after that and he agreed. I very calmly told him that this can never ever happen again. That I cannot raise a baby in a broken home. That whatever we will do right will be worthless if we do this. I asked him to take anger management classes and go to therapy. What followed were the most horrible three weeks of my life. He could not admit wrongdoing. He said that my behavior had triggered him, that my passive aggression is worse than his active aggression, that I am influencing our child to see him as a predator. I tried to have conversations again and again, but he just told me I was the problem and ignored me aggressively. I had anxiety attacks during that time, waking up in the middle of the night with my heart racing. It got so bad that I just started shaking uncontrollably, cold sweat running down my body when he was around. I told him this and he said I should just stop shaking. I researched options to leave, looked at apartments and ways to divorce and co-parent. Then, one day, he kind of came around. He told me that I had been heard. That this will never happen again. The he gets that I will leave if it does. That he admired me for fighting so hard for our daughter. He could not agree to counseling or anger management because that meant putting a “broken” stamp on our relationship and he could not deal with that. It was quiet for a couple of months after that.

Then, last week, we were driving. He used the phone and the car’s navigation system to get directions, something is not working, he gets frustrated, impatiently dictates directions, gets lost and aggressively mutters What The Fuck. When we arrive and get out of the car, calm energy now, I calmly tell him that I think our baby picks up on this energy and that if it’s scary to me, I can only imagine how scary it is to her. He barks at me that that I should diffuse the situation and that me telling him this is aggressive and what he did wasn’t. I try again. I say that I’m not being aggressive, that I’m only asking and he says Fuck you, I’m not doing this and storms off. The next morning, I’m in the bathroom getting ready, grateful that he stayed a little later that morning so I have time to take a shower. Baby is with me on the bathroom floor, we’re playing with makeup brushes. Baby peed on the sheet and he wants to put a new sheet on the mattress. He asks where the sheets are and what I have been doing to protect the mattress and what he’s supposed to do now that the mattress is wet, put on a protector or no protector because the mattress needs a protector but if he puts it on now that it’s wet, the mattress will start molding. His questions and statements are aggressive and impatient. I tell him that his energy is scaring me. His reply: Just shut up and there won’t be anything scary here.

 I tried to talk to him twice after that. He got aggressive and defensive, started lying and twisting reality, tried to push all my buttons so he could turn this around and present ME as the aggressor, then threatened divorce if I continued to see him as a predator. I told him that I can’t do this anymore, that we need to go see a therapist. I begged. I asked him to please do this for our baby if he can’t do it for us. That I love him so much, that this is fixable, that it will be amazing to grow together and figure this out. He coldly asked me what happened if he didn’t agree, and I just quietly said that I can’t do this, that I would need to leave. And he said that I’ll have to leave then and he was done with the conversation. He aggressively ignored me and the baby for two days, then came back in the room, smiled, and expected for things to go back to normal.

For what happened in the 10 years between the first incident and these latest ones, I have no neat package. I have no understanding of what is actually going on. I only have fragmented thoughts, events and feelings.

When a conversation gets heated, I end up not knowing what’s up and what’s down. I don’t know how this happens. It has something to do with him twisting reality and getting into the Red Zone when I push a point that’s just true beyond doubt. When he realizes that there is no logical way other than admitting to a mistake, a line is crossed, and all bets are off.

When I make a mistake and apologize, to him, he doesn’t accept my apology. His response is basically that I should be feeling bad.

In the beginning, when I still fought back, I packed my bags a lot of times. He would always try to force me to stay when I was about to walk out the door. Once things got so heated, neighbors called the police. Our landlord’s son (we lived in the same apartment for 6 years before we moved to the house we now live in) once knocked on the door and said: I don’t know if things ever get physical, but you don’t need to be treated this way and we are here to help. Our other neighbor once said bluntly with both of us present: Listen, we know he beats you up. When we got back home after that, he said that this is what we get from my drama. That people think he beats me.

He got actually physical three times, but I have to say that I was never afraid that he would actually physically harm me. Two times he pinned me down on the bed. I don’t remember the ‘reason.’ Once, we had been working 48 hours straight on a project with a tight deadline. I said that I had to sleep for a few hours; that I had it under control, that I would meet the deadline even with a few hours of rest. He demanded I do one more thing because he didn’t agree with MY assessment for MY portion of the work that he knew a lot less about and than me and could not really assess. I said I could not go one minute longer, let alone complete what he wanted me to complete before going home, and he pulled me out of the chair by my neck and pinned me against the wall. We never talked about this after. My behavior had not brought this on. My tone in response to his demand that I keep working might have been defensive or cranky or even non-negotiable, but definitely in the reasonable realm.

One more thing that’s noticeable about him is a complete lack of empathy. I have never known anyone to respond to the pain they cause with such indifference.

His being late is almost comical. And by late I mean hours late because he just doesn’t care. (He says that himself: I don’t care. If I care, I’m on time.)

He talks about himself and his accomplishments, plans and thoughts with great passion and for hours and hours. As long as someone will listen. (I listened for 10 years. We really talked about him almost exclusively for all this time.) But the moment the person talks about themselves, his eyes glaze over, his energy shifts to disinterest, and he’ll very quickly start looking around the room or start playing with his phone. This is not true in conversations with people he respects or considers worthy of being liked by.

When I tell him something, anything, his first and only response is to dismiss and/or question it. This can be something simple, like: I think the trail will be muddy and his response, immediate and without thinking and weird because I know the trail and he doesn’t: Bullshit. Or joy: I open the oven and the cake I made turned out exactly like I wanted and I laugh and dance with joy and he walks in stonefaced and I try: Look, look, look, oh isn’t it amazing? And he says nothing and I try again: What do you think? And he says, well I don’t know I haven’t tried it yet.

He screams at service people on the phone or in person if they don’t give him what he wants. Even if they are right and he is completely in the wrong, like showing up at the gate for a flight when the gate has already closed.

It has always been clear to me that he understood on some level after an incident that what he did was wrong. He would, following an incident, always say what a terrible person he is. But never related to the incident. Just in a general, almost victim-like way. He would sometimes offer a blank apology, but when asked what he’s apologizing for, he would just say because you feel bad. When asked if that means he could have done something better, the answer is always no. 

He has problems with a lot of people he interacts with on a regular basis. He makes people cry at work, people keep telling him that he is abrasive and arrogant and hard to work with. He doesn’t really have any friends other than former love interests.

It sometimes feel that to him, he and I are the same person. It feels like he sees my accomplishments, in some way, as his own.

Let me end by saying that I’m a work in progress, too. I make a lot of mistakes. I tend to need space for myself. I can get annoyed which I know is so hurtful. When I’m stressed out, I get all flustered and overwhelmed. That’s bad and I know it, but I do own my stuff. When I make a mistake, I admit it. I apologize, I need to make things right to feel at peace with myself. And I work on it. I make sure I stay in a good space mentally, emotionally and spiritually, I seek advice, I try to grow. 

What do I do? A divorce? Is that better for my little girl? Growing up a child of divorced parents? Potentially a messy co-parenting situation in which I cannot protect her when she is with him? Or her growing up without a dad in her life? What is the right thing to do here?

t2_3i0h123y,1553823881.0,b6rfbp,t3_b6rfbp,74,"I am not asking for financial advice, which I know is probably going to happen regardless in the comments. 

My husband grew up dirt poor in the USSR, then Ukraine. He moved here in the late 90s. He was a kind, amazing person and we right away fell for each other. He still is those things, and we are still in love, but we have had a lot of financial difficulties lately. 

It was sort of a compound of problems which happened. For one, the rent on our apartment went up by quite a bit, then we had to pay for our daughter to go to rehab, we had to have a super expensive repairs to both the house and the car in the past 3 months, then ALSO our son went off to college recently. Even worse, our dog might need ACL surgery, adding onto the constant flurry of financial burdens. We have had to cut back on nearly everything. 

We have been strained for money, a lot, for the past 3-4 months. I have been kind of freaking out because this is only going to get worse with our sons college charging us large amounts, and our rent rising. There is also the stress of our daughter in rehab now. She was addicted to weed, which isn't deadly or anything, but she absolutely did need to go rehab, she was the one who requested for help. But my husband? He sort of downplays everything, and constantly brings up that nothing we experience here is comparable to what he went through in Ukraine. He always brings up that even though we cant afford nice things as much anymore, at least we don't have people killing each other in the streets and no running water and poverty everywhere and not able to afford food or medicine. I kind of feel like he feels a bit smug because he has been through so much horror in his life that this feels like nothing to him, but to me its a big deal. I wouldn't quite say he 'shoves it in my face' how bad his past was compared to this, but... kind of subtly he does. 

And like, I get it. The struggle period we are going through is likely not nearly as bad as his childhood. Him and his brother were kidnapped in 1995 and held at gunpoint for 3 days. He went through food shortages and his family had to wait for hours just for bread in the 1990s. Their apartment door was broken, and they had to live without a door for 6 months because they couldn't afford a new one. I've heard it all from him and his brothers and his parents and all of them. It was horrible, and it was probably a lot more horrible than what we are going through now. 

But it is still frustrating, because I know some part of him is being smug about this, as if I am so sheltered that this would seem like a big deal. I know he is right, but that doesn't make my frustrations any lesser. I have told him this before, to stop acting smug and pretentious because he has been through way worse, and he sort of laughs and says sorry... then does it again. 

I do love my husband a lot, but he can sort of not take things seriously a lot of the time. He can be smug and arrogant sometimes. But typically to other people, not me. 

what should I do?

Throughout these years, I've regretted what I did but was never brave enough to apologise.

We happened to have picked the same major as me at another college so I bump into him a lot. I finally got the courage to apologise and act extra nice to him to make up for what I did in the past. 

He admitted he forgot the whole incident and asked what I was apologising for. It's just awkward they see us like this. I guess I am awkward around him as I can't forget the past (even though he admitted he couldn't remember the argument after I apologised) and he seemed awkward around me.

Maybe suddenly talking to him after avoiding him for years was too abrupt for him. Also avoided adding him as a Facebook friend for years and he still haven't accepted my recent request lol. Guess my change in attitude creeped him out.

I've known her for nearly 1 year now but over the last 4-5 months we've been hanging out together at work almost exclusively and even exchanged phone numbers recently. She is beautiful and i do feel very sexually attracted to her. On Valentines Day of this year she asked me if i had plans and i told her no because i was going through a breakup. I asked about her love life and she responded saying it was non-existent. To any normal guy, that would've been the cue to swoop in and ask her on a date for Valentines day right? 

Here's the problem(s): she calls herself a single mom BUT still lives with her ex! Not only that but there's another dude at work who lurks around from time to time who she claims is ""just a friend"" even though i know for a fact, via some nude photos HE showed me, that they've fooled around. But whatever, I'm just her friend and its not my business who or what she fucks right? I certainly don't want to shame her that I've known this for months so I've kept it to myself. For those reasons, and her mood swings that annoy the fuck out of me sometimes, I've effectively friendzoned her.

Lask week during lunch break, i was talking to another girl we work with. Very casual stuff, nothing noteworthy. After lunch tho, WTF?  My ""BGF"" shunned me, wouldn't talk, became really aggressive in her mannerisms and started swearing alot. She was obviously very jealous and it's not the first time either. It happens quite a bit actually. I don't get it. Other than the sexually inappropriate jokes and playful sexual chemistry we have, she's never explicitly stated that she likes me or has feelings for me. Matter of fact, just a few days before this, she took off to lunch with her ""friend"" from the last paragraph and left me all alone with no one to smoke with! I'm so confused! Its been a long post. Forgive me. But I'd like some feedback.

So to skip all the fluff, last night three of my friends came over to celebrate my birthday. We watched a movie on the couch because I was recently in a car accident and am on bed rest. While my husband, Steve, and my other two friends were in the smoking room, Lola comes up to me in the living room and says, “Hey, do I have your permission to ask Steve to follow me to “friend’s” house in his car?”

Me: “You don’t need my permission to ask him but I already know the answer and he’ll say no. He’s really tired. So just leave him be. Why do you want him to follow you, your tire will make it.”

Lola: “Yeah but are you ok with me asking?”

Continuous back and forth about me asking “why?” and her saying “are you ok with it?”

Me, getting frustrated: ”Lola, your tire is fine. You’ll make it. Besides, he’ll say no. He just spent all day at school, went to the gym, then he took care of the kids and still has to put them to bed and then do his homework. He’s really tired and he’s going to say no.”

Lola: “I know all that but still. Are you ok with it?”

Me: “Ok with what?!”

Lola: “Me asking Steve to follow me.”

Me, frustrated: “Why do you need my permission?!”

Lola: “To see if you’re ok with it.”

Me, very frustrated at this point,: “I don’t care if you ask him but he’s going to say no! He’s tired and would rather be at home with his family. And I don’t know why you’re asking because even though I’m telling you that he will say no and why he’ll say no, but let me guess, you’re going to go in that room and ask anyway. Right? Lola, why would he want to leave his family to take you home?”

Lola: “Because he cares about me and wants to make sure I get there safely.”

Me: “I think he would rather be home helping his injured wife on her birthday than following you “friend’s” place. You know what, Lola... Whatever! Go ask him but he’s going to say no. Why even bother asking?!”

Lola, biggest smile on her face: “He won’t! He cares about me.”

She goes straight into the room and in front of everyone goes, “Steeeeeevvvee would you follow me in your car?”

My husband, who is a comedian at heart, answered the nicest way, but I could tell he surprised/annoyed, “Follow you? Why?” When she tells him about her tire, he says, “Lola, your tire is fine. I’m really tired and you know that. I had a long day and still have homework.” Everyone in the room agreed that the tire is fine told her to calm down when she got a bit upset, “But don’t you want to see me home safe?” Steve: “Lisa needs my help. You’re fine.”

She left. Was gone for two hours then came back and stayed quiet until Steve came down around 10pm to finish the movie with us. That’s when she perked up and started talking again.

That was last night and I would have brushed it off but then add the comments like, “Yeah, Steve’s hot. I’d do him.” Always asking if her clothes are appropriate to wear in front of him... but then goes and wears the lowest cut top ever. When she came over and did mushrooms, she only wanted him to help her and when he was gone because he was sick of her hanging off him, kept asking where he was and when he was coming back. Then she’s sent me a nude and an explicit video of her and said, “Don’t show Steve!” Like, why the hell would I show him in the first place?! 

And her track record for dating married men is... well, it has me worried as she says it’s ok if the relationship isn’t doing well... anyway, I had a conversation with her just this week about the things she says regarding Steve makes me uncomfortable. Then this happened last night. She’s a family friend and considered another daughter to my family... so I don’t know what to do.

Am I reading into things? Lola says I am. Steve says that she is just weird but has no boundaries. But I think she likes him... and I want to cut contact but can’t due to seeing her at family functions. Can’t talk to our friend group. Can’t really talk to my parents because they don’t think she likes him but they agree she has issues and needs therapy. 

Ugh... I just don’t know what to do.

t2_8gt1e,1553875093.0,b6z0q7,t3_b6z0q7,10,"The title might be a little misleading. I am very happy that my friend is now sober. She's been sober for almost 10 months now, and I'm proud of her for that. But I feel a lot of resentment toward her and don't know if I want to continue the friendship. We've been friends for almost 15 years. 

I could go on and on about all the things she's done over the years that have hurt our relationship, but I'll try to keep it brief. Her drinking caused her to do a lot of things that I really felt uncomfortable with, such as having an affair with her former boss who was married with 3 children and sleeping with my boyfriend at the time's best friend who had a long term girlfriend. She would continually put me and my friends in potentially dangerous situations trying to go home with guys that were shady and getting mad or even physical with us when we would try to stop her. 

One of the big things that drastically hurt our relationship is initiating a threesome with me and the guy I was seeing. When I tried to call it off, they didn't stop and I ended up just leaving while they continued. That seriously broke my trust and hurt me a lot. She apologized profusely and I told her I forgave her and I get it was a drunken mistake but I know I am angry about it because I really liked the guy and that ruined my relationship with him (not that she was the only one responsible for the situation). Soon after that we went out to celebrate my college graduation with my roommates and some of my other friends. One of them brought along a guy I thought was cute and I wanted to try to talk to. I told my friends that and they all told me to go for it, but later that night my friend tried to get him to sleep with her, he refused and she flipped out to the point he left and then she accused him of stealing $400 out of her wallet and wanted me to get my roommate involved because he was her boyfriend's friend. I was pretty confident he didn't steal from her and when I brought it up to my roommate she refused to get involved knowing that my friend can be a little off the rails sometimes. This was all right before she got sober. 

I could describe many more instances where things like this have happened, but I'm sure you all get the picture. 

I have since moved to a different state and haven't done a great job keeping in touch, but I try to get together with her when I'm in town and ask her how she's doing occasionally. I bought her a Christmas gift and invited her to spend Christmas with my family since she is not close with hers, but she declined. Last time I saw her she didn't even ask about my new job (which was a big and exciting deal for me) and didn't even know what city I now live in. I know her sobriety takes a lot of effort and dedication on her part so she may not have time to worry about all the things going on in my life, but I feel like she has made no effort at all. I feel resentful that I spent years being her friend when she was a giant mess and now that she seems to have it together, she doesn't have time for me. 

I'm back in town visiting my family and I'm supposed to see her tonight, and honestly I feel like I don't even want to. I feel guilty because I should be happy and supportive of her new life that she seems to be doing great in, and we have mutual friends who I don't want to upset by not continuing a relationship with her. 

When is it okay to say you don't want to be someone's friend anymore? Especially after so many years of friendship.

i have recently figured out that my bathroom extractor fan is not working very well. the bedroom above the bathroom now has bubbling on the wall, and i figure that recent hot showers are the culprit.

i am a diy noobie but i am hoping this is something i can do myself. i gather it might involve stripping the wall, or sanding the wall, and then repainting, possibly with anti-damp paint. i have done some searching on the internet but would love some clarification from a human! please ELI5 as much as possible :)

They currently discharge by the side of my house and then the discharged water then runs down the driveway and pools at the driveway basin. No good. 

My first step will be installing a brand new check valve on both. One has a very old one and the other one didn't have one at all. So hopefully that will help a lot with the frequency of how much they currently run.

Second, I am going to extend them out, across the driveway and out about 20 feet into a dead and unused area of our yard where water has never pooled during rain. The asphalt driveway already had a channel cut across it from what I could best guess was a dish tv hoop up so that part was made a whole lot easier for me.

First big question is, would it be safe to run both lines into one when I start to pitch downhill? Or just run both lines side by side? They are both inch and a half. Could I run them into a 2inch and not lose flow?

Second, how should I end the run? I am in New Jersey so freezing temps are a concern in the winter. Someone told me just use a 90 degree pop up fitting at the end and leave the top right at ground level. Others have said to keep the end of the run underground. 

If I keep it underground what is the best way to set that up to avoid water pooling in the area or backing back up into the lines?

Or do you think the pumps will have enough force to push the water through a 90 at the end with a pop up attachment?

Thanks DIY, im fairly new at this but I am all aboard on doing it myself and doing the grunt work. Just looking for the absolute best approach.",DIY,Suggestions on how to end sump pump discharge run

I've read around online a fair amount but have a couple of questions, if anyone can help. I've read that you need to lay parquet on a solid floor - either concrete or sturdy ply. I've got a few options of where I could lay it but the ideal spot would be the top floor landing which currently has the worst laminate. This is two floors up and while I could lay ply no problem, I'm wondering if there's a reason that I've really only seen parquet on ground floors before. Is the extra movement going to mean it ages poorly?

Secondly, 18mm ply is recommended, then the blocks themselves are maybe 20mm, giving a total thickness (not including glue) of around 4cm (an inch and a half). The current laminate is a few mm thick and laid on top of some thin foam, so the parquet will be a considerable amount deeper. I'm happy to trim round the edges as needed, but potentially there will be a height difference going into the bedrooms on either side. They currently have the same crappy laminate - in future we might get carpet, sand back the floorboards or lay more parquet. It's hard to imagine what a height difference on each threshold would look/feel like. It'd be a couple of centimetres at most but I don't want to realise after installing that it looks awful and means we stub our toes daily. Can anyone offer advice?

There are other areas in the house I could lay it but I'm keen to replace the worst laminate first and most other areas have some decent laminate that we can live with for a few more years.

I have made myself an LED lit (edgelit) picture frame with pillars of creation. It has a dimmer controller, so I can make it just subtly glow, or light up pretty well, stronger than regular night-lights.

I am trying to figure out two problems. First one is the light bleed around the edges, you can sort of see it in the picture, I am not sure how to evenly diffuse it, making it backlit vs. edge-lit is not an option unless I make the frame thicker, its 1.5"" already. Second issue is the washed out colors, which are not that bad on lower levels, but I get bothered when I crank up the brightness.

I have ordered another poster on thicker full gloss paper hoping it will reduce the washed out colors. I have also put a slight vignetting on it to reduce the edge bleed. We will see how that works in few days.

How its build: 20"" x 16"" x 1.5"" frame for IKEA. Clear acrylic sheet, poster, several filters and diffusers from TV panels, 1/8"" thick plastic sheet also from TV, LEDs around the edges and back plate with reflective white sheet at the end. One note, the LEDs are not shining directly on the edge of the 1/8"" sheet, they are above it. I had to cut it to size making 2 edges murky, they don't pass on too much light making light distribution uneven.

Any thoughts on improvements would be appreciated.",DIY,"Made myself a LED-backlight picture frame, looking for some advice on making it better"

My house was built in 1918 and the porch is due for some repair.

I ripped out an area of flooring and a railing on the back of my porch. The floor boards were rotted and the column also rotted where they attached the railing. Someone must have redone this railing before and decided to cut a hole in the column and run the railing into the hole, but that allowed water to get in and rot the wood. Now I have a hole to repair in the side of a hollow column.

**Questions:**

1. What do you all think is the best way to repair the hole in the column? I will need to reattach the railing where the hole is currently, but I will probably flush mount it to the column with a bracket and/or screws.
2. I am going to replace the flooring in this area with new boards? Thoughts on using douglas fir (I know this has been standard in the past)? Is it worth milling tongues and grooves into my floor boards or should I just let them butt against each other?
3. Should I do anything to protect the tops of the joists below the floor? They are mostly in good shape under the damaged areas, and all in great shape further under the roof. I may replace/sister some of them, but I'd like to prevent further damage. From what I have read it sounds like they should be fine as long as the floor boards above are not rotting.",DIY,Repairing a Rotted Porch Column and Floor

My dad wanted to gift my mom a fountain for our rather large garden, so he ordered one a few years back from a blacksmith. My parents wanted it to be out of weathering steel, sadly we now have the problem that this specific kind of weathering steel continues to rust away, so it was not sealed properly by the manufaturer for this purpose where its always in contact with water. There are specific chemicals to seal it, but it would cost around 500€ to buy them. 

So I thaught I could just get 10 or 20kg of Expoxy resin, and coat the parts that are in most contact with the water after cleaning and sanding them down.

t2_41mvo1,1553873859.0,b6ys4u,t3_b6ys4u,4,"Hi Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been friends with my best friend for around 4 years. It was always just us two (Super close) but as of last year, we became close with my other friend. Lets call that friend Alexa and my bestfriend Beth.

The reason why I'm posting this is because I want to know if I'm overreacting in this situation because it is really starting to bug me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So A and B have been acquaintances for a long time until last year when they started to become really close.

We're all in the same university, so we meet up frequently (about once a week). I like Alexa, she is nice and sweet but the way she always puts herself down and compliments B ethis starting to annoy me. Alexa literally thinks that Beth (My best friend) is above her and even me.  Don't get me wrong, I love my bestfriend but the way Alexa behaves around her annoys me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, here's some background info that might help:

&amp;#x200B;

Alexa: single and has never been in a proper relationship.

Beth (my bestfriend): has been dating someone for a while now (he is wealthy based on what she tells us,)

Me: I've been dating someone for a while too. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are some situations that have annoyed me: 

\- We were standing on the drain waiting in line to get food from a truck, and  Alexa was like we shouldn't allow Beth to step on the drain because she is a ""princess"". 

\-Alexa genuinely believes that Beth can do better than her current boyfriend and tells her to date a richer guy . She says this ALOT., which is weird because Beth doesn't have any problems in a relationship. 

Also, its funny because Alexa she never tells me I can do better. 

\- If Beth says that a guy talked to her Alexa immediately says ""Oh its because you're so pretty""

\- Beth told me that Alexa asked her to buy her a painting in the future because  she is going to marry a rich man. 

\- Alexa goes around saying that Beth will be a professor one day (when nothing has been confirmed..)

\- Alexa tagged me on a facebook about a perfect couple (rich, and attractive) saying that its Beth and her boyfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has been going on since Alexa first joined us. I know I can't do anything about it, but why does Alexa behave around Beth like this?? I don't want to start a fight, but her behavior is really starting to annoy me. 

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; Other friend keeps complimenting my best friend and even puts herself down. It is starting to bug me. What can I do?

TL;DR: basically the title.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, my father called me at work to announce the death of my paternal grandmother. The discussion was short, he didn't ask for any input. He just announced it, said she was talking a lot about me, told me she was getting buried and that he hoped I would come.

&amp;#x200B;

The relationship between my parents exploded when I was 16 and highlighted all the years of emotional abuse and neglect I suffered from both of them. I chose to stay with my mother and to visit my father when I wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

I distanced myself from my father because of all the lies he would pathologically tell, but the final staw was discovering that the reason why my parents were getting a divorce was because he had emptied my mother, my sister and my bank account, which would make 10k€ (roughly 11k$). I cut him off my life and changed my phone number.

&amp;#x200B;

After getting my own flat for my studies, I was able to realize how deep the issue was with both my parents and tried to acknowledge my own feelings.

I ended my studies a year and a half ago, found a job and went VLC with my mother for my own sake.

&amp;#x200B;

I took my afternoon and the day after off because it brought up a lot of things I had buried inside (no pun intended).

&amp;#x200B;

Later, he messaged me the time and place of the funeral, said that my grandmother was at peace and that her passing could help us bonding back.

I asked him how he got my number, and he answered me that he followed my studies path in spite of our quarrels and asked my university my phone number months ago. He added that he only used it in painful cirumstances as I could see, and I could be assured that he would stay in the shadows as long as I wish.

&amp;#x200B;

I am at loss. I don't know what I truly feel and I don't know if I should go to the funeral. My family is very small, I don't think there will be a lot of people there and I don't want to discuss anything with my father. At the same time, I think it is unfair not to go because my grandmother was not responsible for this and travelling a few hours to pay my respects is not much to ask.

t2_tpcjr,1553861683.0,b6wivk,t3_b6wivk,2,"I feel really lost here, I think I know the right thing to do but I need reassurance. My partner and I have been together almost two years. I love her dearly, we are perfect together and I have no doubt about that. I am aware we are young, but we've both dated a lot previously and feel this is right. Of course, I'm aware that I'm in love and that's going to affect how I see the reality around this relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm living in Italy at the moment for study, while my partner is living in Australia. I will be in Italy for a year (ending in Jan 2020) and go back to Australia to finish my degree. My partner, however, is going to overseas for a year next year to do the same thing as I'm doing currently. This would mean we would be doing two years long distance. We always knew this would be something we would have to deal with, but we never discussed any options besides just doing long distance for two years. It's been three months and I have my ups and downs. My partner seems to be doing okay, but she's not the type to open up (unless I'm with her in person) which has been an issue in the past. If she is in a bad place I tend to feel a bit cut out, which is hard because I can't just go to her house and help her feel better. To be completely honest, I am doubting whether we can do two years of this. The alternative is that we break up, which is literally my worst nightmare. I don't think in any way that I depend on her or anything, I am capable of living without her, I am now, but I don't want to live my life without her. She is my best friend and partner. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where the problem starts. When we said our teary goodbye at the airport she asked if I could move with her overseas when she has to go. I told her that I can't go next year as I have to finish my degree, but if she were to change it to the following year I could move with her. We discussed this option and she made a meeting with the director of her degree to discuss the option. We now know that she has the option to do her study abroad the year after I get back, which means we would only have 10 months of long distance left. I want her to choose this option, I can't lie, but I can't tell her this because I want this choice to be hers. She hasn't made up her mind, either she goes next year alone or I go the following year with her. Some history for context is that she has already lived abroad by herself in Africa and France for a while and hated it. She felt extremely depressed the entire time and couldn't wait to come home. I'm worried the same will happen if she goes alone next year. However, from talking to her about her choice, I know she is worried she might be less inclined to go out and do things if I'm there because we will get very comfortable living together and we're just happy to spend all our time together. I feel hurt thinking that she might choose to not go with me, even though I know it's stupid. I'm worried we won't be able to do two years apart, with her tendency to shut down and my tendency to overthink. 

&amp;#x200B;

The few times I've spoken about her decision it's just been to check in on how she's going. She's told me she doesn't even want to think about it because it's too stressful and it makes it too real for her. I understand this but at the same time I'm getting frustrated not knowing what's going on. I don't want to push her to make a decision, but at the same time her decision affects me too, and I can't help but know I will be deeply upset if she chooses to go by herself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I mention my concerns to her? That maybe we won't be able to do two years long distance? Should I bring it up to her that I'm worried about her mental health if she goes alone and feels as depressed as she did when she previously lived abroad? But more importantly, how do I cope with this?

I appreciate that she is being honest. She insists she is  100% monogamous and I do not have any reason to believe she would lie.  But I am still not OK with this, and I say ""Go ahead and do these  things, but I can't be with you."" Her and therapist are like ""wait why can't you be accepting.. all relationships need work... you are being judgemental... etc."" Furthermore, I feel that this is hopeless because even if she doesn't get ""permission"" from me to do these things, she obviously wants to do them and my attitude will cause resentment.

Given that, I’ve decided it’s best not to ask them out.

Anyway, they came over and everyone got in a big fight and went their separate ways. My mother, who was a single mother, had been expecting her siblings to help out and be a resource and had this fanciful idea of sibling solidarity, however, her siblings were interested in self-advancement and did not seem to show whatever ""gratitude"" my mother expected from them for her effort in bringing them from a hellish situation in a bad part of Africa to the U.S, an effort that cost her many thousands of dollars. I was a kid then and none of this was my business.

Anyway, one of these siblings was my uncle and he lived with us for two or three years when he first arrived. After that he left to another state and I never heard from him again. Anyway, now I'm older and one of his children (still in Africa) has reached out to me on Facebook. He says his old man (my uncle) is out of work and he wants me to send him some money for ""books."" He's also told me that many other relatives in Africa want my contact details, and after they receive them I assume that they too will flood me with requests for money (that's how it works in my mom's culture)....

I'm a young professional, with not a whole lot of money, and unlike my mother, I'm not sure I want to spend my working years sending money to unknown relatives in Africa (i'd rather save for retirement). I'm afraid if I give him the money he requests, my cousin will ask for future money as well (and he's one out of a large number of children my uncle has). I feel conflicted. On one hand, these people are my blood relatives and poor compared to me, but on the other hand I'd have to sacrifice my financial stability if I helped them out.

So i’m going to keep this as short as possible.

——————Background Context————-———
My (ex) best friend comes from a tough up bringing. Her mum and dad fight a lot, her dad is unsupportive of her, and her mum has MS. She has a sister [14] whom she is very close with. It is also important to note that she comes from an upbringing where no one ever apologises for anything they do wrong.

I don’t have many friends by choice, I’m not a very open person and I find it hard to trust easily. I have my boyfriend (been together for 1+ years) and i had her. thats kinda it.

—————-where the story begins———————
It started 2 weeks ago on a friday,  she was in an awful mood so i decided to give her space. Monday came by, and i decided to give her space still as i hadn’t talked to her over the weekend and she still seemed irritated. After the monday, she suddenly stopped talking to me. By wednesday, i had made an effort to mend things by giving her a hug and saying hello, to which she replied, “that was random”. I can honestly say, i have done nothing. I would never bad mouth her, or say anything nasty to her. 

She has completely cut me off, she won’t even look at me at school. 

I cant cope with not knowing why, she was kinda my only actual female friend, and i told her everything. should i confront her? The reason i haven’t confronted her is because i am ALWAYS the first person to make things better - frankly, i’m sick of it, and i don’t want to look dumb if she actually doesn’t want to be my friend and is trying to cut ties.

Honestly, if she said to me straight up, i don’t want to be friends anymore, i would be okay (obviously not happy, but i could deal with it).


TLDR; My bestfriend has suddenly stopped talking to me and i’m heartbroken. Should i confront her, even though i’m always the first person to mend things? or should i let it go? (she may not even want to be friends with anymore for all i know)

For a while now, I have noticed that my bf tends to look at strangers for longer than i personally find necessary, and it makes me feel rather uncomfortable. I also feel a bit upset because this often happens when we are having a conversation while walking together hand in hand. I know he IS listening to me as he does keep up with our convo but I just will like him to yknow, be looking at me more when I’m talking instead of at other people.

I have previously told him about how I feel and he explained that he didn’t think he was staring; he had been looking at those people as he either found them familiar or there was something amusing about them (my bf likes to joke and make fun of people, not in the unkind way).  I also told him that I know it is human nature to look if you see someone attractive but he stares at people (both guys and girls but 70% of the time it’s girls) so obviously and so often that it makes me feel uncomfortable. He also declared that he wasn’t actually checking out those girls I saw him looking at. I trust my bf and find his reasoning largely rational so I’ve kept quiet since, but it’s still something that bothers me a little inside.

And then.. today when we were out together, I saw him looking at two girls for longer than necessary and calmly told him that he’s being a bit too obvious again. However he told me that he hadn’t actually been looking at anyone but something in that spot crossed his mind at that moment hence he became distracted. This made me wonder whether I’m getting too insecure at this point. I used to have a tendency of getting insecure and it’s something I’m still working on, so I really don’t blow up this issue again if it’s actually just me being insecure.

t2_3gmr3shm,1553878301.0,b6zo0q,t3_b6zo0q,8,"long read 

    My (30f) partner (28m) of ten years works a full time job of 40 hours a week or more.. (depending on the season as he farms) I’m a stay at home mom to three kids (8 and under).. I’m horribly unhappy in our relationship/family life, I feel like I’m alone all the time and my partner doesn’t contribute anything except his pay check. I have told him this and he tells me I’m the problem, and no matter what I’m not happy. So I have no idea if I really am the problem or if I have a reason to think he isn’t putting his effort into our relationship.. 

   Now, because of his work he basically gets to create his own hours and come and go to work as he pleases. Sometimes he will tell me he is at work when in fact he is at a buddies house, or the bar etc. Or he will go straight to a buddies house to drink after work and not tell me what he’s doing. I have asked him to call me and let me know what’s up and he tells me if I want to know where he is I can call him. There has been days where he is literally only home to sleep, then he’s out the door. And if I question him about what he’s doing, he will give me a huffy one word answer and be gone. Then days later I will find out from someone else he was at a buddies house or at some event. 

He goes out to drink multiple times a week usually, the least he goes out in a week is one night at least. Now I understand everyone needs their nights out and time to themselves, but how is it fair I sit at home every night by myself while he has a social life? He tells me that’s my fault and not his and that he can’t be my friend. Our kids are young and I am their primary care giver.  I also have no interest in going out and drinking like he does, and I’ve told him this. And I’ve told him it’s pretty hard for me to have a social life with kids and responsibilities. Everyone tells me I will have my chance when the kids grow up, but why does he get to do whatever he wants while I’m the parent and responsible one in this situation? 

   He doesn’t lift a finger around the house, which I understand when he isn’t home or he is actually working. He’s washed the dishes three times in the past seven months, and he will give the kids a bath maybe once every few weeks. That’s the extent of his helping. When he is home he usually sits and plays video games or heads outside to do his own things. I have asked him to be more involved around the house, such as maybe cook once a week etc. He tells me he works and doesn’t have time, but yet he has time to hang out with his friends whenever he wants.  We moved last summer and I did all the packing myself. When I asked him for help organizing and packing he told me he has a real job and I don’t, so anything house related is my job alone. 

  He also has tons of hobbies that take time and money such as hunting, quading, snowmobiling. During hunting season I’m basically invisible to him and barely see him for three weeks. I understand having a hobby but I feel like he takes it to the extreme, and I’ve told him this. Once again he tells me to get my own hobby. What he doesn’t realize is that he gets to have all these hobbies and time with friends because I am here taking care of the kids, house etc. And when I bring this up to him it usually results in him yelling in my face to leave and to do my own thing. 

Getting him to do anything with the kids and I is like pulling teeth. I’m the one who takes them to visit his parents, my parents, and any family between us. When the kids and I go do something fun we usually bring my mother in law with. The odd times he does go with us to anything he is cranky and mean and starts a fight or argument. I don’t think it’s normal that any family outings include his mom and not him. His family and him seem to think this is normal though and I can’t seem to get my opinion in or understood. 

 I used to take the kids for a weekend and go visit his family who live over an hour away but I stopped doing this due to the stress of coming home. I would come home to him still in bed at 5 p.m, extremely hung over and puking all day. Our dogs would have no food or water as well. (The dogs are my responsibility) and the house would be a disaster even though I left it clean. I put up with coming home to this for four years, but recently I just can’t handle coming home to that situation anymore. 

  He will complain about the meals I cook and flat out tell me he’s not eating it if it’s something he doesn’t like. Sometimes I cook things the kids like and he doesn’t, because well, kids are picky. He will ask me what I’m going to cook for him instead. When he gets home from work he will go straight to his video games and tell me to make him a plate. Which I was doing until recently, the last time he asked me I told him to turn off his game and get his own damn plate. He has never made me a plate, nor would I ask him to. He will tell me to do his laundry, and usually throw in a joke about how I don’t do anything. 

 I have also talked to him about getting a job myself over the past few years. (I was working when we had two kids) he has told me that if I get a job he won’t help any more than he already does. So that would mean I would have a job on top of all the child care, cooking, cleaning, pets etc. This alone has stopped me from getting even a part time job because I already feel like I have a lot on my plate. 

Also If I bring up something that happened he will flat out tell me it didn’t happen. Or if he does the dishes once in months, it turns into, “I always do the dishes” or “I just did the dishes, you’re crazy” it’s gotten to the point where I start to question if things did happen because he tries so hard to convince me they didn’t or they did. 

TLDR - partner doesn’t contribute to anything except a pay check, tells me I’m the problem. Am I overreacting and should he get to do whatever he wants because he’s the one with the “real” job ?

I plan on moving out in a month to live with her. I do everything for her. Despite this, she is not always nice to me. She doesn't seem to appreciate all the money I spend on her or the lengths I go to to try and help her.

Whenever she is self aware about this (occasionally) she starts crying, and blames her depression. She lacks the motivation to look for work, which I think would help a lot. If she could get a job and health insurance, we could look into medication and therapy.

t2_3i1p8nxw,1553836558.0,b6tb8t,t3_b6tb8t,24,"My spouse is angry, like, a lot. We are married with two kids (2 and 4); I work a busy job full time, and she stays home to take care of the kids. We've been married for 8 years, and I've always found her to be easily angered and not in complete control of her emotions, but I finally thought I'd anonymously ask here to see if I can get a read from others and get some advice, perhaps.

I notice when something angers her (kids are stressing her out, the house is dirty, some goal she has is not going well, etc), it is as if she has the worst life in the world and nothing is acceptable. In these situations she becomes extremely, unforgivingly mean and curt with me, and picks fights. It is as if she preys on me; she'll be very clearly in one of her ""angry moods"" (ie, when I get home from work), and I notice right away, and then there's the same inevitable sequence of events practically every time: She'll act quiet and curt and obviously unpleasant and snarky just waiting for me to make some mistake, or for some prior transgression to come to light, and then she'll explode and be ruthlessly mean to me for the entire night with that as her reason, as if it's justified. The thing though, is that my ""mistake/transgression"" doesn't justify this in my mind.

It will be that, for example, I didn't wash the table, or I put the dishes away in the wrong place (to be fair, for the many'th time). Often I notice she'll create some situation where it's \_impossible\_ to not make her mad. She'll ask me to get her something and I won't know where it is, which will outrage her, or she'll ask when some event is happening and I won't know, or the event depends on another person, which is outrageous, etc.

Today, two things happened that made her extremely mad and now we aren't talking: when I got home, she was clearly in one of those ""moods"" so I was generally pleasant and careful, while trying to be myself as not to be fake or anything. We've just moved into a new home, and we haven't ordered blinds yet for the windows. I'd previously suggested getting a quote from a few places, which she agreed with, but suddenly it's completely unacceptable that it's taking so long, which by some stretch is my fault. She fairly abruptly told me angrily (unprovoked?) that it was ""driving her crazy"".

Later, I asked her if everything was okay and she said ""no, the kids are driving her crazy"" and then when I asked if she wanted to talk she curtly and angrily said ""no"". This entire time she was not at all maintaining eye contact or anything. I got the hint and stopped pressing, but then she decided to clean the closet and discovered that I had put tupperware back into the bin we keep them in in an unorganized manner and proceeded to explode at me. She looked almost ready to cry.

I'm not saying I'm perfect, but I'm really not leaving anything out here I think; she has said that when I'm annoyed she can see it in my face. It's possible my body language isn't great, but I'm trying to be calm and not provoke when she's like this.

When she's not like this, it's a different world, and the division is very clear.

Now, I can connect the dots; the kids are stressing her out and she's in a rotten mood. But often it's for extremely trivial reasons, and it always comes back to her being outraged at me for entire days.

I have no idea what to do; talking to her doesn't seem like a good idea, at least certainly not until she comes out of her mood (which, at worst, can take a week). When I've approached her better about managing her feelings, etc, she immediately told me I was accusing her of being ""crazy"" so I backed away from this.

Also, there will be months on end when she's okay, and then rough patches where I feel like she acts this way every second night. If any non-trivial stressor exists in her life, I'm public enemy number 1 and deserve to be treated like trash - for some reason she'll readily find.

What do you guys think?? What can I do for her? What \_should\_ I do for her? I think therapy is out of the question, at least having her voluntarily attend.

If there is something about my own behavior that needs fixing, I'm also happy to reflect and work on. I already feel like I need to be pretty careful around my home a lot of the time. :/

Unfortunately, her ex of a few years moved back into town (broken up for 6 months) and while say had previously said she was over him.... that wasn't the case. He selfishly moved away to travel and they tried long distance, but he didn't make any effort and they broke up a few times. We started seeing each other about 6 months after they broke-up. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was tough, but I guess I understood. We were really new and obviously she needed to find out if she still felt the same way about him (she thought they would get married before he moved). He found out about us and made her block me and unfollow me on all social media. Apparently it was a pretty big issue for a while (he didn't think they would date other people?). 

&amp;#x200B;

We remained friends and honestly, that was ok. Some people you just like having in your life in any way. Over the past year we there are periods where we talk more and periods we talk less. I've seen her out and about a few times with her BF and she even came back to the bar after leaving with him to catch up. A few weeks ago she wanted to go grab drinks, which went fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was feeling like a normal friendship and I was treating her like I treat my other friends. It's been a rough few months and it was nice having someone I cared about in my life (new town and not a whole lot of friends I can talk to). Then recently she skipped out on an event I was speaking at to go hiking (she was required to attend). It bothered me, since I don't get to see her often and I was really looking forward to it. I told her it was a little shitty to skip and then I got this a few days later:

But I just need to be clear that this is all this will ever be.""

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, she was the one initiating hanging out ever time and reaches out to me when she needs things. I send her jokes and memes sometimes. She still isn't allowed to talk to me per her boyfriend. I would understand if I was trying to ""win"" her back.... but I've bent over backwards to be her friend. I've helped her out in bad situations when she has asked (which she doesnt do for me). 

&amp;#x200B;

That EVER really hurt. I just can't imagine saying that to someone. I'm not trying to get her back, but there are certainly feelings there. She asked if I thought we could be just friends and..... I thought that's what we were doing; so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do differently.  Not help her next time? I told her it was up to her, as it wasnt affecting my relationship but obviously it was affecting hers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does she mean the ""ever""? Or is she just trying to distance herself again? I guess what I'm asking is that I wouldn't ever say something so harsh to someone I cared about as a friend. So either she doesn't have feelings for me even as a friend, or she does and it's still causing a problem in her relationship?

So my brother met his now wife in school, then moved to her state once they both finished their medical programs.

t2_3ehe0fmf,1553874538.0,b6ywwd,t3_b6ywwd,2,"Full disclosure, I cross-posted in r/BreakUps:

So, my ex posted a photo of himself with his new girlfriend of one year last week. One of his friends commented something pithy about how cute and happy they were together and how happy she made him. And it's great, I'm glad to see he's doing well.

Our background: we broke up YEARS ago... we were extremely happy together and deeply in love, then went long distance and everything fell apart. The breakup was rather ugly. We got back in touch a couple of years after and became friends, but, to be honest, the friendship was very up and down. My ex has Asperger's and was in a habit of pushing me away with something snarky that cut very deep then pulling me very close, confiding in me, flirting with me, telling me he was pretty sure I was the love of his life.

Anyways, this carried on for a while, and my feelings for him run pretty deep so even though I think on a whole this was stressing me out a lot, he told me talking to me made him happy and he felt so lonely and I had missed him so much that I continued to play with fire. I also probably thought there was something more on his end. We were still living thousands of miles apart and that wasn't going to change any time soon, but we talked many times a day for a few years (including memes, youtube videos, songs feelings, the whole works demonstrative of a strong friendship).

And then he ghosted me after he and his new girlfriend got together. He did not tell me that there was a new lady in the picture, instead he basically told me he hated me and I was terrible and then left. I mourned the loss of his friendship (though it was undeniably fraught) and my confused feelings, and have been slowly letting go of him as an integral part of my life because it's so clearly not going to work out to even be friends.

But seeing him so happy with someone else is simultaneously nice and hard. I'm happy he's happy, but it's hard for me to not see this as a reflection of my worth. I was such a toss-away and yet he, who is so stressed and intense about everything, is just living a bundle of joy and rainbows and sparkles with this new person. I am glad he's found someone great for him (and I'm sure she is!) and even more so, I'm glad he found someone to hang out with / a person to go on adventures with because I know he was missing that. But I feel like this is really just a message that I am not worthy, I am not good enough, I am too much, I am not pretty, I was not good enough to stick out the bad times with. When things were good, we were both on cloud 9 (like he seems to be all the time with this new lady, which is, again, very good), even as friends. But he just... dumped me on the side of the road and hasn't looked back since. After all that time... no explanation, no nothing, just ""you don't deserve my time and you're awful"" in response to a meme. I just figured it out because I'm not an idiot.

The main question: This happens all the time - loves of people's lives move on and find someone new. Does anyone have any tips for not taking it personally?

We've been having unprotected sex (pull-out) and I asked him what would happen If I fell pregnant? He said he would support my decision, but in his heart he's unsure about having kids. He also said his last girlfriend was against kids, and that is one of the reasons why they broke up. (?)  


The problem with Tedd is that he is living with roommates, traveling to wineries/whisky bars every weekend, taking Molly and going to warehouse parties.

I LOVE to party as well and so do my friends. But we all do it with decent jobs, houses, kids and careers.

I know he's been bankrupt a couple of times and he is driving his grandmas car. In the time that we've been dating, he's taken 6 weekend getaway vacations. This is the first time in his life that he has had medical insurance. He's been able to travel the world, which is cool, but I mean he doesn't have much to show for himself at his age.

I am developing feelings for him, and it's difficult for me to see someone casually without imagining it as something long-term. Should I continue to see him casually, but still keep my other options open? How do I have that conversation with him? (Should we be sexually exclusive, what happens if either of us meets a better match...?)

Butcher here. Working on converting a refrigerator cutout in my kitchen to a dry curing chamber for making dry-cured sausages and whole muscles. Main issues are humidity and temperature control. 

https://m.imgur.com/t1DHGel

The area is 84.5x21.5x19; measured in inches. I have a landing on top I plan to install 3-4 computer compressor fans with Peltier modules and two internal fans to circulate air. I’ll install a humidifier and control the whole thing through a hygrometer and thermostat that’ll cycle on and off to control temps at safe-ish temps. Plan to install insulation and aluminum walls, and seal with spray foam and weather stripped door. Most heavy lifting will be done by ambient temperature (the house hovers between 65-70F) and the compressors just need to bring it down to 40-50 or so and maintain. 

Does this design make sense? Do I need more fans? Will it be super loud, and on all the time? What would you do to solve this problem? It’s essentially a fridge. Maybe I’d be better off finding a free fridge, removing all the parts and installing it in the alcove? I know converting a refrigerator is easier but it’s also less elegant and this is fucking cool.

I recently acquired a blower motor from a decommissioned fume hood at work. My intention was to use it in a cyclone saw dust extraction system for my table saw. I have since looked at the data sheet and realized that it won't be powerful enough for that, and the fan not open enough to allow much material to pass smoothly.

I'm now wondering if I can use it as a passive dust collector for finer dust. I've seen posts of people using a large box fan with furnace filter as a cheap dust collector. Does anyone know whether this fan will work (using a smaller filter)?

Any help or suggested uses for the fan are greatly appreciated.

I am making an alarm clock/speaker thing. I have NEVER done soldering or electronics before and I am looking to ""cut a corner"".  
Firstly, I think this is not an option, but I thought I would at least find out.  


The speaker set is USB (it has a USB cable you solder on that plugs into -suprise- a USB port) but the alarm clock hs nothing. All it says is that it needs DC 3.5 - 5.5 V power. It doesn't specify battery e.t.c and it came with no battery connector or anything.  


My (questionable) idea is to crudely splice the alarm clock onto the USB cable designed to be soldered to the speaker set.  
I'm no electrician but, having covered circuits loosely at school (in physics) I know that, in parallel circuits, like this one would be, the Vlotage remains unchanged but current is shared, and thus reduced, in each part of the parallel circuit.  


Would the drop in current cause a problem or could I get away with it. (this doesn't have to be a ""long term"" thing, only for 2-3 months)

So, this was probably a playhouse at one point, and I plan to fix it up to to be a playhouse once more.

I have a budget of about $500 to make this an enjoyable, safe place for my two daughters to play. (6 and 2, currently)

My plan is to keep the existing frame of the structure intact. Build a subfloor with studs to get the first level off the ground a bit. Wall the interior of the lower level with plywood, and attempt to seal it completely to avoid wasps getting through. (I know, that's probably a stretch, this thing was full of wasps last year) I would replace the existing window and possibly add one or two more. The barn style door would be completely rebuilt. With the new sub floor, the new door would be a few inches off the ground so it won't get stuck in the grass like it is in the pictures.

Once the interior of the lower level is done, I would move on to the interior of the upper level. Replace the thin plywood floor. Replace or rebuild the door. Replace the window. Cover the inside with plywood and attempt to seal it. 

Once the inside of the upper level is done, I would strip the remaining parts of the exterior walls off, and cover with plywood. At this point (or sooner) my budget will probably be reached. Maybe down the road we can cover it with some vinyl siding. 

There will be, at the very least, a ladder or a simple staircase built to access the upper level. Potentially a rope ladder or rockwall kind of thing.

I would love to hear what you all think of my ""plan"". Thank you in advance!

I live in a bi-level home and recently noticed some  [very light water spotting in the corner of a lower level room.](https://i.imgur.com/hN7TU7y.jpg)  After inspecting the siding [outside where the water spots are located](https://i.imgur.com/uZ85TwV.jpg) , I noticed a 1 inch gap filled with some type of [sheet insulation](https://i.imgur.com/MCsWlV1.jpg)  in the 4 spaces where the siding meets the underside of our deck. 

It's clear that I need to either seal the gaps or divert the water from dripping down through the siding but I'm not sure the best way to accomplish this. If I seal the gaps, I am concerned about reducing the air flow under the siding and potentially trapping moisture - making the problem worse. 

In researching the issue, the best comparison I could find was to treat this area like you would the top of a window by installing a J channel strip and diverting the water away from the opening. Should I hire someone to take the siding off and install a J channel or would I be okay putting some backing rod and caulking the gaps?

I've sharpened my knifes with a Japanese wet stone for some time, but I'm just now getting into sharpening my planes and chisels.

Since I sharpen my knives by hand, the stones are most likely not completely flat (although they seem quite flat to the eye). I have a little stone rectangle that is supposed to help flatten them, but I don't know how well it works.

I also recently got a cheap diamond sharpening stone.

Questions:

1. Should I use the diamond sharpening stone to flatten my wet stones, to sharpen my blades, or both?
2. My wet stones are 800/4000 grit. I also have that gray stone in the background. It has no marking. Is there anyway to guess its grit? And does it look like stone I would use with water or oil? Should I bother with it at all?

We've been friends for a while and started dating a few weeks ago, after having had a thing for a few months. We would always make out and do things for me (orally), but when I tried to do things to her she would always say no and be really resistant. I never forced anything on her, I thought maybe she just wasn't ready for that yet but now I found out the real reason. So apparently she has HSV-1 (oral herpes) on her genitals, and she got it from being eaten out by a boyfriend who had it. I've done a lot of research, and I guess it isn't that bad, it's not as bad as HSV-2 which is a much more volatile strain and has way more outbreaks and is just overall worse. Apparently she got it about a year ago, got it tested and found out, and hasn't had an outbreak since the initial one and even then it was just a few bumps that hurt. That being said I know she could be having outbreaks in her cervix and just not be aware of it, she said once she was having a PH imbalance issue which might have just been an outbreak she wasn't aware of. Anyway, I need some advice. I heard that as long as she's on the antiviral meds some couples don't even wear a condom?!? I think I'm always gonna wear a condom and avoid sex during her period cause I'm sure more blood involved probably makes things much more risky. Is this a deal breaker to any of you?

t2_f9kwb,1553844825.0,b6ublt,t3_b6ublt,23,"Background 
I invited a woman I knew through social networks for a drink. She accepted the date excitedly, she informed me she didn't drink but would love to join me. We had great chemistry and following this, she purchased tickets for a second date, but I had declined as the timing was not good. I was traveling for business and she was going to an international athletics competition + a one-month remote hike with her retired father to celebrate graduation.

We kept in touch, and saw each other casually, she wanted more, we had a coffee together, gave me a book with a small note, prepared a picnic with home cooked food. She asked to date again and when I answered us both traveling for two months shortly as an issue she asked to be friends with benefits.

A month of a casual relationship later, she asked again to date exclusively just before I departed as she felt I would sleep around overseas; I knew it was too early, and yet I agreed. I concluded through the small gestures she was girlfriend material.

During this trip, we kept in touch via video calls, and I got to know her further, her values and about her history. She asked probing questions on who I was, what was important to me etc.

Upon returning we had our 2nd official date and built a strong relationship over the next + 1 year, she was by all accounts a very good girlfriend, inexperienced but otherwise excellent.

Last week she rescheduled a fitness activity she was joining me, we need to talk she stated.

When I see her, she immediately starts crying, she confesses she cheated on me once in the first few weeks after the early exclusivity whilst she was overseas for the athletics competition. She noted she went to a party, got drunk (as an athlete she seldom drinks) and had a one night stand with another athlete.

She had confessed to her parents and they stated it was unfair to me knowing I would not tolerate infidelity. In her letter she left behind after the conversation, she stated I deserve to know the truth and that she was so very sorry, she was appalled she did that to me, now that things were becoming more serious it was important I be informed. She said that everything since we returned, when we actually went on the legit second date onwards was real.

I said I would have to end the the relationship and have taken some time of no contact to digest.

I'm speaking to advisors and close friends for counsel, I'm mostly surprised she could omit the truth for so long and that she would have casual sex when she pursued me so aggressively.

**TL;DR;** :
Have 1 date with girl, she wants relationship but I decline due to travel. She asks for friends with benefits to keep interaction going. I agree - she works hard to prove she is gf material. She asks for relationship again before I depart for business trip, I agree. We both travel, she cheats on one night stand at internation sports competition.

The story:

He was involved in a fender bender and when he pulled out his phone to show me a photo, I noticed he had been texting with a girl I didn’t recognise and asked him. Turned out to be a former neighbour who he still spoke to.

This lead to the question of whether there was anyone else out there he texted a lot. And then he mentioned this girl, who he mentioned as one of his best friends, that he texts daily.

No screaming match or anything so dramatic just me saying these things:
‘At the point in our relationship I felt like I should have been aware of anyone you’re close enough to text with on a daily basis’
‘What would your opinion be if you just found out that I’d been texting with a guy on a daily basis’
His response was more to the fact that ‘he hasn’t seen her in four years’

Day after and I’m just feeling it’s sitting worse with me (as far as I’m aware I’ve heard of other male friends he texts frequently, could have brought her up before - I’m in the middle of studying the subject she studied etc)

So my general question is this, what would your reaction be? I’m looking for perspective on whether I’m making a mountain out of a mole hill or whether I should talk to him and say this has thrown me for a loop but let’s just move past it

I wanted to also tell the story before I gave a little more background.
I’m a divorcee, my marriage broke up because my husband cheated on me, but more do in hindsight spent hours on the phone texting his girlfriend and hiding in the bathroom to do it as well.
I’m also Larry’s first serious long-term girlfriend, so I give him a large benefit of the doubt for being naive.

Not sure how much that impacts the base question of requesting your reaction but I will freely admit I am sensitive to phone use and have been upfront with Larry day one that trust is my biggest issue.

I know this because she keeps bragging on how easy it was for her to raise me.

We've been dating for almost two years,  she's always lived with her mom.  I moved in about a year ago, as a temporary thing that got prolonged. I hit some bad times financially and she offered a cheap place to live, so I took her up on it, mom is an angel and very cool. It was ok at first, not my favorite to be under a parent's roof again, but it's easy living.

 I picked up a second job but she still only works two days a week, I work 7. She complains that we never get time together but we live together, I take her on dates, we walk to the dog. But the real differences are in motivation, she's a night owl, i'm not,  she likes to sit at bars, I'd rather play pool or throw darts, she's not a clean person, I vacuum my car almost weekly.

So, we work on the same team but are all remote, for the most part, so we live a couple hundred miles away from each other in different major cities. She is on leave for a surgery she’s recovering from (although is fairly mobile), and I’ve been down here covering for her in the local office for two weeks and am leaving today to go back to my city.

We became good friends on a previous work trip when we didn’t know each other so well, but then got into a really deep conversation over drinks one night about mental health, our issues, how we are dealing with them, etc., and found that we aligned on a lot of different things. We kind of became “mental health allies” and started to lean on each other for support in tough moments and every day normal life challenges. We’re there to listen to each other and we give each other lots of encouragement and positivity, which is amazing.

I’ve started to develop feelings for her as a person that feel kind of romantic and then sometimes feel like strong friend feelings, but are always really strong feelings.

We’ve hung out in person a few times since I’ve been down here and we’ve continued to have good times and deep conversations, usually over drinks. There have been some emotional moments and some points where we didn’t see eye to eye, but overall our hangouts have left me on an emotional high, since it’s really hard to find people who “get it”. It’s absurdly refreshing and feels amazing. I have a suspicion that she feels similarly, but it’s a suspicion and I don’t actually know, I don’t want to push the issue.

She mentioned once to me that she would probably make out with me if I wasn’t on her team. I told her I was thinking about the same thing but agreed that we’re coworkers and that wouldn’t be appropriate (and could make work really awkward depending on what happens down the line), and that I don’t want to mess up the friend dynamic we currently have. Now her telling me that says nothing about whether or not she has romantic feelings towards me, but I’m not going to pry.

Also, she’s going through some really really heavy shit this month (including two very recent deaths of people who were close to her), and I’m feeling particularly sympathetic and want to be there for her as much as possible. 

Some quick background on my mental health: through working with my therapist, it was determined a few months back that I’ve got anxious-avoidant attachment issues. This toppled my last long term relationship (and a couple of others, although I’m really regretting the last one). I also have a history of depression and various forms of anxiety and trust issues.

My texts to her tend to be somewhat emotionally charged in a supportive friend type of way, but I def hold back the entirety of what I’m feeling because that’s a whole other set of complication to impose on her, especially since she’s going through some rough shit right now; I don’t want to add to that.

I think that my feelings are probably disproportionately strong in regards to our situation, and the fact that we don’t know each other that well on a peripheral basis. The feelings are constantly welling inside of me though and it’s really really difficult to rein them in. I love the strong friendship feelings but I don’t love the romantic side of those feeling and can’t really see us being in a relationship of any sort; least of all because we’re long distance and coworkers, but also I just don’t know her well enough to even know whether or not we’d be compatible. 

This feels so weird and backwards to me. 

I’ve decided that the right thing to do is to remain friends and maintain the type of friendship we currently have, because I think that will be best for both of us. I think this is the right thing to do. And maybe I should rein in my emotionally charged texts a bit, but still be supportive and empathetic.

My dilemma is that I don’t know what to do with my feelings. I can separate facts from emotions, but the emotions are still there and strong as ever. I just want to hug her for a really long time. 

I’m not seeing the therapist until next week but I’m just not sure what to do with my feelings until then.

 But I'm really worried my insecurity will ruin things. For example, yesterday while he was out I took to snooping his Facebook messages. Like years deep I'm talking. It was a total invasion of privacy and I feel terrible. This isn't the first time I've done it. 

I found nothing except that he used to, prior to our relationship, have a crush on a girl he's friends with. Yet my insecurity kicked in. We have the sort of relationship where we bring up these things. The fact he's not brought it up makes me feel anxious. They're much less close than they used to be, so I'm not really stressed about things happening now, but my mind asks if something happened in the past? Maybe he regrets not being able to get with her when she became single again during our relationship? Reasonable me knows that he loves me and that everyone has crushes that fade in meaning when you're actually with someome, so why does my mind work this way? 

My trust issues mainly manifest themselves in snooping. I'm not controlling, I don't mind him going out clubbing, having female friends, or hanging out in groups with people he was involved with in the past. Some of these things do admittedly cause me to sit home anxious, but I recognise that's my issue not his. I love him and want the best for him and would never ask him to stop socialising because of me, but the little voice in my brain says otherwise. 

Before anyone asks, no he has not given me reason to be insecure. I think my behaviour stems from the fact that I found out about my dad's infidelity as a kid while looking through his emails (I was searching for the Amazon receipt for the birthday present I'd asked for). I would definitely attribute my trust issues to there, rather than my current relationship.

 My question is, do I need to work on myself before I can be in a relationship? I love this man immensely and I want him in my life so badly. But we're doing long distance next year and I'm scared the insecurity will get worse. I will probably only get to see him once from mid August-May, as he'll be on the other side of the world. We have spoken about it at length and really want to make it work. We have both cried in these discussions and I know he feels as deeply about it as I do. I am just scared that my brain will latch on to little things and make me anxious and upset for the good part of a year while he's away. 

Do I confess my snooping ways? Do I try long-distance? Should I even be in a relationship at all? The idea of not having him in my life breaks my heart, but maybe it's best?

 Of course that hurt me very much, specially because there was no warning, she never told me anything was bothering her, so I felt she just throw me away like I was nothing. So because of that  I decided to avoid activities where I could see her,  in games and places in general. 

Talking with a mutual friend  she told me that back then I told her something that hurt her and offended her, I never knew what it was, I recall being drunk at the time so I have no memory of the day, I just know it hurt her so deeply  she decided it was best to not talk to me ever again. I still care about her, she was someone very important in my life, and I deeply regret hurting her because that was never my intention. 

I know she doesn't wants to speak to me, and because of the way she is I know she would never answer back;  our mutual friend told me she does not want to have me in her life, something that I respect, but I still wonder should I send her a mail apologizing for what I did?

It was a tiny duplex, and had thick walls and carpet. I was mainly stuck in my room whenever I wanted to study or watch TV, as he had lived there alone for some time and paid 3/4 the rent, worked from home, so he was always in the living room. I didn't mind cause of the rent split, however I was ready to have a place where I had space outside of my room. 

We just moved into a pretty big two story house with another roommate. The way it's split up is basically a house with two of the rooms and kitchen on the top floor, then a bedroom, second living room and extra room downstairs. He took the downstairs as, again, he works from home and we figured it'd be his own space. 

He's a very animated person, especially when he's watching anime or funny things, and talks to himself/the TV and laughs VERY boisterously, loudly, and frequently. Every time he does, its like he's in the living room / dining room right next to me. We've tried closing the doors to the downstairs but it only minimally helps. I've brought up to him a couple times now about how easily and loudly the sound travels, but he doesn't seem to get the hint. 

I want him to have his space as well as I have mine, however when he's watching TV and what not, I can't really enjoy our space upstairs. It's very hard to watch a serious movie when you hear howling loud laughter every 5-30 seconds. I can't think of a solution, but something needs to change as I'm going insane and it's only been two weeks here.

And surprise surprise i got a crush on one of them. I started talking to them more and i think at least that we started to connect somewhat. And just this week i managed to get her instagram, which is an achievement for me as an introvert. But i don’t know what to do from here, as i have no previous experience with girls in anyway, i know that what i should do is just ‘ask her out’ but we get very little time alone (about 5 mins a week) and i’m not really too sure how to go about doing it. As well as this i know for a fact that the friend i mentioned earlier also has a crush on her, this is a problem as normally when he is on the bus, he is the centre of attention as he is just a spastic attention whore, these means that i struggle to talk to her properly when he is around as he keeps weird things when they are around. Which she seems to find funny. One benefit of this is that unlike me he isn’t serious with her in anyway, but ultimately i don’t know which is better in her opinion. Furthermore i have a 2 week holiday week after next and after that i have 3 or so weeks until my final exams, and after that i wont be getting the bus anymore until the next school year. Problem is that im struggling to revise for these exams due to the stress of this girl and the approaching exams, and if i were to fail these i would be going to another school in a completely different area next year meaning that i will not be able to see her anymore.
I know that i should ask her out but i’m struggling to push myself to do it and its causing more and more stress on me with my deadline, but as i mentioned i have basically no time alone with her and i’l probably have to do it over instagram, but i have no clue how to go about doing that...

Sorry if this seemed like a whole bunch random points stringed together but i hope i got my point across... any advice would be appreciated!

t2_3gwvwv50,1553880334.0,b702ne,t3_b702ne,5,"I have been with my current boyfriend for over a year and things are becoming more and more uncomfortable when it comes to his relationship with his ex/best friend.

I was aware he was on very good terms and best friends with his ex when we started dating and I am on good terms with my ex too (we don’t really hang out much tho) and I am generally not jealous but things have been getting weirder and weirder. He and her dated for around three years and she was the one who broke up with him but also in a very weird and slow way (distancing herself very slowly without being clear about ending it; moving into the guest bedroom very early on, opening up their relationship six months before she officially broke it off with him, moving out). According to others, my bf had a really hard time getting over her and there was a time he was waiting for her to come back wich probably lasted for over a year. There were two years before he started dating me that he was single.

When I was first introduced to K (his ex) who is about 27 at this point, she was nice and I was nice but she got him a plushie of his favorite animal at the zoo. At first I didn’t really see a big issue with something like that but the more you know about my boyfriend, the weirder this one thing is. My boyfriend used to have a habit of being sexual with his stuffed animals. Idk if this one was intended for that purpose but I know for 100% she knows about his obsession with otter plushies that can become quite sexual.
My ex wouldn’t dare to gift me a plushie because that’s generally a very boyfriend kind of act.
I got on a phone contract with the both of them wich now makes me a bit uncomfortable as to why they even share the same contract in the first place.
For a while K had to go to a different country for her cancer treatment and we both haven’t heard much from her and I was actually super worried and cried about her at the airport. The fact she has cancer so young breaks my heart and also made me not want to cause any additional issues or make her life harder by bitching about how I don’t like a lot of things she os doing. However things became way more dramatic after her return from chemo therapy.

After she returned, my bf was the only one and only him who was allowed to see and visit and do grocery shopping for her because she developed some kind of social anxiety as to why she didn’t want to be seen by anyone but him. 
I didn’t think too much about it and trusted the both of them but after all those months I am not sure if something happened between the two of them.

Eventually she’d get over her anxiety and I would see her again.
Ever since she got back and felt better she has been ordering quite a lot of things (her family is quite wealthy) and it all gets delivered to our house. The reason for this is that apparently packages get stolen where she lives, yet she has other friends than her ex she could ask. And I am talking about 3-8 packages a week here.

She is still on all of my boyfriends apps like HBO, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Crunchyroll and I ran into the issue before where she’d start the new Game of Thrones episodes before us and not play them back so I got a huge spoiler trying to watch them. She doesn’t pay for any of that while she clearly has the money to do so.

Recently my bf bought a second car so I have to park on the street and because of that I now can’t go trough the garage door and need a key. My boyfriend would tell me he had no key but K had the spare one and at first he made it a big deal that I wanted and actually needed the key more. I was furious.

A few months ago, K wanted to move and looked into the house that was up for sale that was right next to us. My bf told me about it and added that there are not enough rooms though, not realizing how much this whole thing was stepping on my toes. I was verbally unhappy and told him how out of line it was for her to move there.

And now the biggest new thing. K calls my bf by the nickname she had for him while they were dating. I flipped my shit about it to get a “I can’t really dictate her what not to say” from my bf.

Everyone around me thinks I am stuck in some weird threeway relationship including my neighbors who said they never saw K as much around prior to me moving in.

Is this really worth fighting for or should I just leave?

t2_3i4cb2hx,1553880177.0,b701kz,t3_b701kz,3,"TL:DR at bottom

I’m sure many will say I jumped into this relationship far too soon, and I know I did. But I’d rather not break up with him just because we both jumped into this relationship too soon 

Back story.  He, my boyfriend, is friends with my older cousin. That’s how he and I met. There is a 12 year age difference and we tried dating when I was 20 but I was far too immature. We broke up and he found someone else and married her and they were married 20 years before she cheated and he divorced her over it. I hadn’t spoken to him in 15, she forbid him from having any contact with me so he finally looked me up on Facebook after he decided to divorce her. They have been divorced since the end of January. 

In the mean time I had married a man that turned out to be pretty bad. He cheated on me with many women, did illegal drugs, stole from me, was abusive, constantly lied, and so forth. I told him I was divorcing him and instead of him letting me have the divorce he drank himself to death at the beginning of January. 

He contacted me back in September on Facebook and I waited to actually meet up with him until after I told my husband I wanted a divorce in November. Once I did that we would meet at Starbucks every Sunday and just chat about what was going on with our lives. 

My husband’s death, while shouldn’t have been, did shock me and I’m still dealing with that. 

We decided to officially start dating in February and we’ve just been enjoying spending time together when we can, we both work and he has a child so our time is still pretty limited though we do see each other several times a week. 

The problem I have is with an ex of his he dated in high school. The lady sent him a friends request on Facebook and she’s made it clear she would like to start up a relationship with him. He has said he has told her he’s dating me but the lady doesn’t seem phased. They exchanged phone numbers and she sent him sexually explicit pictures but she justified it because she’s apparently a swinger and posted the same pictures on Facebook in a secret group she invited him to and he joined even though he tells me he isn’t into that sort of thing. 

I told him I wasn’t comfortable with that, that the pictures are inappropriate and he makes light of it and again justified it like she did...she posted the pictures elsewhere. I asked him how he would feel if one of my exes sent me dick pics and he said he wouldn’t like it. He agrees its wrong but he won’t delete the pictures or tell her it’s inappropriate/not to do it again. 

I don’t have a problem with who he talks to but I do have a problem with the pictures and her inviting him to a swingers group on Facebook. To me that’s crossed several lines and I’ve told him that and he brushes me off. 

Am I right to object to the pictures and the group he joined or is this relationship too new for me to raise any objections?

I believe the move will be good for him considering he really needs to move out from home. My main issue is I’m worried he will struggle financially and that’s the last thing I want for him. 

I have offered to help out in anyway I can, whether it’s gas, food, bills, whatever. I care about him and I don’t want to see him struggle. I especially don’t want him going into this thinking he will be able to get by and then have to move back home again. His friend works about three jobs and my boyfriend works two, between the two of them I’m sure they will be okay, but with my boyfriend’s bills I don’t want him to stress over them and feel I can’t help. 

It’s also not an option for me to move with him as we haven’t been dating that long and I’m not financially ready to move out. We’re also not ready to live together, which is perfectly fine. 

I don’t know if I should let him do this and just be ready to help when he needs it or if I should be trying to talk him out of it? He’s old enough to make his own choice and he’s his own person and knows what he can handle, but as his girlfriend I worry about him including financially. I don’t want him over stressing anything.

t2_2jse27xp,1553879193.0,b6zuho,t3_b6zuho,1,"A bit of context first: I (36M) work in a multinational company as a software engineer. I started in this position a bit more than a year ago (moved in my current city for this job btw), I have a bit over 10 years of professional experience, and been programming for more than 20 years now.

&amp;#x200B;

One year ago, on my first day on the job, I was chatting with one of my new colleagues when ""George"" first showed up, as he proceeded to put his arm around his shoulders and gently shove him aside, so he can start introducing himself and the project to me. He was overwhelming me with way too much information, but giving really unhelpful answers to simple questions that I had (e.g. Q: ""what is this project actually about?"" A: ""oh, this project is just an idea two guys had over a beer""). George is not a manager, he's a member of the dev team (but is the most senior member and his job title reflects that), is in his mid-50s, and has quite an imposing physique. George is in fact a new member of the team too, having been around for only 2 months, but he acts like the team is his own startup.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later, but still in my first week, I review some code that George wrote (for those not working in IT, it's common practice in many companies that code is peer reviewed so that the team can give feedback before it's actually accepted) and I write a few comments. He then comes to my desk, sits next to me, smiles and tells me ""you know, I read your comments and they are all wrong"". I pointed him to some articles online, and a chapter in a book that we had in the office, that were discussing exactly the disagreement that we were having. At that point he became livid and told me he will not read anything (""also Hitler wrote a book!"" - he actually said this), that he knows very well what he's doing, that I'm wasting both his time and mine, and that I should work on the task that he assigned to me. I replied ""then we agree to disagree"" and he had another colleague approve his code.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point it became quite obvious that I'm off to a bad start in a team where I don't really know anyone. I guess I should have complained to HR, but I didn't want to seem like a troublemaker, so I didn't. Besides I was still in probation so I could have been very easily let go. Instead I minded my own work while trying as much as possible to stay out of George's way. I also realized that George is friends with our boss, and the boss of our boss (a VP of the company), for more than 30 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Some other behaviors of him that I started to notice were:

\- he wants all communication with people outside the team (either inside the company, and clients) to go only through himself

\- but then he doesn't really share most of whatever he discusses with the rest of the team, just bits and pieces

\- he has to come up with technical solutions for everything and people have to follow (sometimes he's right, other times he's not and then it's impossible to get him to change his mind, usually his last line of defense being that it's not even his idea, but it's some externally fixed requirement)

\- he acts like somehow he's above the team, comes and goes in the office whenever he feels like without telling anyone anything (there's a team calendar where the rest of us mark our vacation days, or if we work from home on a particular day etc)

&amp;#x200B;

All this time, the other big shot of the team, Rick, is in vacation. He returns to discover that while he way away George took over his position as de facto team leader, and is displeased. Rick is a much more skilled professional than George, but unfortunately has a childish temper (at some point someone crossed him, he threw a tantrum, went home, came back the next day only to throw another tantrum and then went back home), has very poor communication skills and is stubborn as well, and therefore people don't really take him seriously. Rick tries to challenge George but fails, complains to HR, they don't do much about it, so Rick quits.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time I have another incident myself with George, where he says that some code that we wrote is bullshit, and when I try to justify it he mocks me (by repeating, in my voice, what I had just said). He only does this in private btw, and doesn't behave like this with his superiors, of course. I could go on and on about the things he does, but I hope that by now you got the point.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months pass, some people leave the team (in total 7 colleagues left in the last year), others join, it finally becomes obvious to the others as well that George is a problem, so he's assigned something to work on his own for a few months. Magically the team starts to function, I even got an unexpected bonus payment for my work during this time. However, the project is cancelled so we need to find something else to work on.

&amp;#x200B;

Given the situation, I decide it's best if I find myself another team (and a good opportunity to go away from my current one), so I do an internal interview with a team located elsewhere (on a different continent even, but I'm to remain in the same HQ) and they accept me. And it's all great until the new department decides to take my entire old team along, George included.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, one year later, he's again in full take over mode, declaring in the first week already that the new team is doing a shitty job, and trying to impose his ideas on everybody he sees. Then I see him subjecting another new member of the team to the same sort of stuff that he was doing to me last year. The whole situation seems even worse to me now, as I thought I finally managed to get rid of this guy, only for him to follow me in the new team. At least now he's not friends with the entire management chain anymore, but still - what would be my options, besides leaving the company? As I really cannot take the stress of being around this guy anymore... I was hoping that the new managers will figure him out and sideline him, but so far it's not happening.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I have an abusive co-worker that behaves as if he's the manager of the team, though he does not have a mandate for that. I changed teams, but he moved to the new team as well. Any options besides quitting?",relationships,How do I deal with an abusive co-worker?

He finally committed after a few years, but he was an absolutely shitty boyfriend. Major issues included his emotional (and unconfirmed physical) cheating and aggressive bullying when he wouldn’t get his way. Our final breaking point was him screaming at me during my graduation party in front of our families and friends. Everyone was pretty upset by the scene he caused, especially his younger brother, Ryan, who had also become my friend by that point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I finally dumped Randy and moved across the country for grad school, which is where I’m still living today. I haven’t spoken to Randy in almost 4 years, because why would I and also he sucks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ryan and I loosely kept in touch over the years with stuff like birthday texts, Instagram comments, etc., but I hadn’t seen him since I broke up with Randy. About a month ago Ryan texted me that he was in my city for work and wanted to grab a coffee and catch up. So we met up and seriously hit it off. We had always gotten along great, but now we have this amazing chemistry that definitely wasn’t there before.

Ryan wants to pursue a relationship and I’m really into him, but I’m also not sure if it’s a good idea given the fact that his brother is my demented ex-boyfriend.

We both have been dating for 3 years. At the beginning of our relationship he was very nice, I felt happy with him, we spent a lot of time together and never got bored of each other.

Now everything changed, he constantly rejects me emotionally, like he always changes topic when I start talking about my problems or not only problems but about things I like either. He mostly talks about himself and doesn't let me talk about myself. He doesn't want to help with anything at all, he always complains when he has to help me with anything. He never cleans anything after himself. He doesn't even work either so his parents support him financially.

He always pays during dates or any other activity we do together, he is very physically affectionate, always encourages me to try new things.

And beside all of that he doesn't want to help his parents either, so his parents has to constantly nag him in case to get his help.

At first obviously I was skeptical, I mean I didn’t know her at all, and she was clearly into me but I didn’t know her. But after hanging out like 4 times, hooking up a few times, and just spending time with her, I think I like her a lot. I mean she’s suuuuper cute, active, always doing stuff, really nice, super sweet cool. 

I kinda feel like vocalizing how much I like her, but maybe I should just chill out and just go with the flow. I don’t know what our deal is, for all I know she could be hooking up with other guys during this, which is fine, we aren’t exclusive at all. I’m not sure if she would even want to date.

Although I don’t know exactly what I’m really asking on this post. I guess I’m just confused with what we actually are. I guess I’m not ready to actually date her anyway. I feel like we don’t talk enough but maybe it’s good, my last girlfriend was super clingy and had to be talking to me at all times so I think this is just different, not that we’re dating, but you get the idea.

Recently I went to check her reddit profile (I hate checking peoples profiles, not sure why I even did it), and saw her recently posted messages how nobody gives her attention and how nobody cares about her. Which hurt me a lot, I've given her all my attention and told you multiple times how much she means to me and how much I care for her.

So a little background. I(19m) have been seeing a girl(18), we will call her M, for about 6 months. Our relationship is very complicated, it started as just friends w benefits but about a month ago we both confessed we had feelings for each other. I guess you could say we have a “thing”. 


Anyways a few weeks ago M invites me to a party at her friends apartment. I arrive and within 2 minutes M is acting really weird , seems like she is annoyed with me.  I take her aside and try to ask her what’s up but she just shrugs it off and goes back to beer pong. I decide that’s it’s probably no big deal so I go mingle with a few people I know for about 10 minutes . After a while thought I begin to realize M is intentionally avoiding me , so I walk up to her to try to get a conversation going and see if I can put her in a better mood. She continues to act really weird so once again I brush it off . Anyways a couple minutes later my friend tells me that he wants to go to a different party , which I agree to because I’m annoyed about the way M has been acting and because I want to see some of my other friends. I walk back into the kitchen to say goodbye to M and I sitting on the counter next to some dude having a conversation. Decided that based on the way M had been acting all night it’d be best to leave her alone , so I just turn around without saying goodbye and get in my car and head to the next party . 

Anyways fast forward to the next  day , M is texting me and apologizes for acting weird she claims she was just in a bad mood , I decide fair enough , and that was that . M ended up coming over that night and spending the night so it seemed like everything was back to normal . 


Fast forward to the next weekend , I find out from one of my friends that the night of that party she ended up hooking up with that dude I saw her talking to in the kitchen at the party. This makes me furious because I do have feelings for her . I promptly drive to M’s house , she gets in my car , and I say “I know you hooked up with that dude at the party, whatever we are is over , get the **** out of my car.” Of course she starts to beg and plead but I’m not having it . She starts by using her being drunk as an excuse, to which I respond that if she really had feelings for me she wouldn’t have hooked up with someone even if she was drunk . She then reminds me that we had never decided to make our relationship “exclusive”, which is actually a good point, but I wasn’t having it and I kicked her out of my car. That was about 6 days ago and I have no spoken to her since , she has texted me a few times trying to apologize but I haven’t responded at all. 


I guess my question for you all is , am I in the wrong here? Do I have a right to be mad ? I understand that we were not technically “exclusive”, but considering we had both admitted feelings for each other and had been going out for a few months , I think it’s messed up for her to do that to me . Just wanting to know what you all think , am I overreacting ?

After spending all of my twenties in unsatisfying relationships with men, I had a fling with another woman. It opened my eyes and I came to the realization this year that I am a lesbian. 

My roommate and I are very close friends. She is bisexual and has been very supportive during this time of discovery.

My roommate, meanwhile, is very, very close friends with a friend of ours. Let’s call her Sarah. My roommate and Sarah have a very intense and tumultuous friendship. Sarah is also in a long-term open relationship with another woman.

My roommate, Sarah and I went out for lesbian night this week. I’m not very close without Sarah, but we’ve been getting closer since I came out. That night at the bar, I noticed how cute Sarah is, and knowing she is in an open relationship, I started flirting with her.  She was very receptive, and when we had a moment alone, we kissed.

In the car ride home, I told my roommate I wanted to fuck Sarah. Rather than the usual, “you go, girl!” response, my roommate looked horrified and told me under no circumstances would that be a good idea.  When I pressed her on why, she eventually broke down and told me that she was in love with Sarah, she had been for years, she’s never told her and it had been eating her up inside.

Sarah has been texting me to hang out and I’m pretty sure she wants to sleep with me. Would it be wrong to? I’m developing a crush on her And am just starting to explore my sexuality after years of being repressed. It doesn’t seem fair that I can’t fool around with Sarah because my roommate has feelings for her.

Tl;dr: After years of lying to myself and repressing my feelings, I recently came out and kissed my roommate’s best friend, who is in a serious, but open relationship.

Basically I'm building a brushless motor drive to attach to my bicycle's left crank which will be replaced by a crank with gears. That way I will be able to gear it down/up thus adjusting torque vs max speed.

It's by no means ideal or well built but I'm only missing the gear for the chain at the output rod.
I need to weld a 08B-12T 7mm thick steal roller chain gear with a 10mm bore to the driving rod which is an 8mm threaded rod, not sure what thread but I can find out.

As of now my option is welding but the bore is wider than the rod so I don't know if that would be fine maybe with 2 nuts if I melted them enough. Also it probably wouldn't be centered properly.

I'm mainly asking for advice since I'm no expert in building things properly. Maybe there's some part I could buy to thread on the rod and properly mount the gear on? Or at least widen the rod those extra 2mm 😅

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I need help on the proper way to prevent water from getting under the J channel above the external of the garage. 

Vinyl siding on the house, comes down to a j channel, apparently 2 layers of aluminum wrapped around the wood pieces around the garage (where I found trapped water). Bottom of j channel was caulked to the aluminum wrap. 
I believe improper overlapping was done (no caulk, and at some point someone put a sheet metal screw through a j channel). 
This is for a 2 door garage and a single door garage (both had water trapped between aluminum wrap and wood). 
I’m asking because I believe a drip pan was left out, but I am unsure of the order to install each when going back up.. would the drip pan be first, then j channel, the aluminum wrap.. or should the small lip of the drip pan be noticeable externally when the instal is finished.

[This is the current state of the pool](https://i.imgur.com/C28kmAG.jpg)

This started a couple of years ago when we had a season of really heavy rain which caused the sand/dirt/ground on the right side of the pool to slide in and crack the concrete deck on that side and also cause bulges and tears on the pool wall. Back then my father decided to empty the pool to work fixing the bulging and tears(He has years of experience working with fiberglass in other fields).

Work on it stopped for reasons but they are ready to work on it again.

The problem right now is that my dad doesnt have enough space in the right side to place the fixed fiberglass pieces back in place. What he wants to do is to remove all of the right side(red square in the image) . And put some kind of wall structure in place(plywood sheets or metal) so the dirt(yellow arrows) does not slide back down again(rain season is about to start again). And flatten down the ground in that side so we can walk on it and to get it ready for the concrete deck. He says that after that he will be able to place the fiberglass back easily.

Me and my mom think that is not a good idea, we think that it is going to take too much time and might not work in the end. We think he needs to use the sand bags in the bottom of the pool to create a barricade in the right side of the pool and patch it out immediately. Then he can fill the outside hole again with dirt or gravel and flatten it out.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think is the best course of action here? Do you have other idea? Most of the problem right now is the right side.

I also have read that gravel is actually recommended to use around pools instead of dirt in cases like this. Do you think that is true and maybe what we should do? My dad doesnt think gravel is a good idea.",DIY,Help fixing a fiberglass pool. Please give your input

-Use more fibreglass insulation (there is already some sticking down on that wall from behind the stairs I could essentially tie into)
-Expanding foam the whole thing (although I had issues with it sticking yesterday) 
-Rockwool (don’t think it does that thickness though)

I fixed a mug on my table where I used Gorilla Glue Gel to put the two pieces back together but I  had it upside down to let the glue dry and not stick to the table. Low and behold the vapors inside the mug without being able to escape I guess pulled up the finish and my head is on the chopping block. I'm assuming the alcohol pulled it up but are there any ideas on how to fix this without sanding and refinishing? I think maybe if a take a small amount of some finish and making sure it is rubbed in and feathered should do the trick? It isn't a water ring which would be easier to understand and work with.

Okay so I tried to keep this short, but it's mad long - my apologies.

So I \[19F\] met this guy \[20M\] at a bar on campus a few weeks ago and he asked me out to dinner. We went to dinner the next night, had a pretty good time (he seemed normal enough), so I was down to see where things went. We hung out casually again that week and had a great time, so that following weekend I asked him out on a more ambitious date.

We went pretty far off-campus to a restaurant and then a bar, and he ended up staying over. Admittedly, I was pretty drunk and missed a lot of red flags in the moment (him expressing he had developed feelings for me over the course of a week(?) and sharing personal, vulnerable information with me). I was caught so off-guard (and was very drunk) at the time, so I just kind of went along with what he said (mostly to be polite, but I obviously didn't verbally reciprocate the feelings part).

He told me that he hadn't had many relationship experiences in the past, and that girls tended to have sex with him but not commit to anything, and \~whoops\~ I told him that night that I was at a point in my life where if I was going to have sex with someone, it would have to be someone that I trusted/was planning on having feelings for eventually, and that I had a pretty good intuition about my feelings when meeting someone (aka I usually know within the first couple of dates whether or not I'm going to seriously like someone or not). Both of those things were true in theory, but I just thought he was nice and initially normal and so I was seeing where things were going - and not trying to do anything serious with him (he definitely and understandably thought I was referring to him while saying that though). So that night, even though I had originally expressed that I was pretty drunk and I didn't think it would be the best idea, we had sex (multiple times).

The next morning, I reflected and realized how big of a red flag some of the things he had said to me were, but I am notorious for being stubborn and not giving guys a chance, so when he sort of hinted that he was free that following night, I told him to come over. This is where shit hit the fan. I'm not going to go into too much detail, but it was one of the most uncomfortable experiences I had ever had with a guy. I quickly realized that he wasn't socially aware (he asked me questions that I wasn't comfortable answering multiple times until I gave him an answer), was texting his sister in the midst of us doing things in bed (they're very close which is fine but really strange time to be texting her), and started freaking out about us having sex because he thought we were moving too fast even though we had literally had sex that morning (to which I responded if he wasn't comfortable, that was fine and I wouldn't pressure hm to do anything bc I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable, but after 10 minutes of him going back and forth with himself, he decided he wanted to have sex even though at that point I just wasn't down anymore), etc (cuz there's A LOT more). He ended up staying the night (I just did NOT know how to kick him out after all of that which is on me), and WOULDN'T LEAVE the next morning after I told him I wasn't feeling well and I had a busy day.

Right then and there I clearly knew I had to end things, but I wasn't sure how bc we weren't ""dating"" we were just seeing each other. The next week was spring break, so I wasn't going to see him for a week, and I was PRAYING things would just fizzle out. I tried to make things clear over text to see if that would work, not responding enthusiastically or at all if he texted me, and after spring break ended, I really thought I had gotten the message across. But the Monday we got back, after my not responding to his last texts, he texted me three more times asking when he could take me out on an other date. I said kinda coldly that I wasn't feeling well, and that I was busy this weekend, but would be happy to get coffee with him (which was when I was planning on telling him that this is not working for me). The coffee date is today. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue for me, but I do feel as though I've lead him on without trying to and since he is so inexperienced he's going to take this really badly. PLEASE help me come up with something to say so that I don't hurt him/don't look bad in the process. I go to a really small uni where everyone knows each other and reputation is sadly important, and he could really slander me if this ends badly.

We have great relationship management skills (e.g., we can talk about things openly and honestly, we’re OK with arguing, we’re generous, etc). We had a lot of crazy ups and downs over the first year of our relationship for a number of reasons (we met at work, we both moved to different, but relatively close, cities, we went from seeing each other every day to seeing each other every weekend, we were in new places with no friends, etc). We overcame that and now we’re stable.  Now we’re moving in together in the summer. 

My girlfriend was already on birth control pills when we first started dating. I’ve recently read that attraction changes for women when they go off birth control. Of note, there was a finding that couples were likelier to break up when a) the couple met while the woman was on BC, and b) the woman eventually got off BC while in the relationship. And that this was true when women were with less “conventionally attractive” male partners. 

I think I am conventionally less attractive. I look really young for my age (I get 19 a lot), I’m a big dude (though active and relatively healthy, much more so than before), and I don’t have a lot of facial hair. So naturally, I’ve started to become paranoid that, when she gets off the pill, she’s going to lose her attraction to me and find me intolerable or annoying. I’ve asked her about it, and she thinks it’ll be fine and it goes beyond hormones. I also sort of think there’s a transition period in going on/off BC, and that any struggles will require couples therapy but, with good management, will be overcome. Meanwhile, I also wonder if the *transition* from going on/off BC is the real reason people break up, and not actually what the BC does. (I’m a social scientist and am skeptical about experimental and quasi-experimental studies without a close examination of what’s actually happening.) 

I guess all to say: should i be worried? Does anyone have experiences with going off BC (or their SO going off BC) and the relationship changing (or not)? What should I be worried about and when should I be worried about it? Are these things good relationship management can overcome?

this may sound like a really silly thing to ask, but I am interested in opinions of other people.

I'm not a really good cook nor do I like to cook. I mostly only make simple, fast and cheap things for myself... imagine the basic student meals.

I am in a LDR an I would really like to cook dinner for us on my visit this weekend. More specifically his favourite dish (which I never ate before, but I watched some recipe videos on how to make it and tried it at home... it wasn't really a success but  I think I know how I can improve some things about it now that I made it).  He often makes fun of my cooking skills in general and also really loves food, good food. 

I am so split if I should still try to make his favourite dish (I was hoping it'd make him happy that I wanted to make it even if it's from a different culture and the fact that I remember details he tells me) or if I should try something else, but that just seems less personal which is not the intention of this whole thing. I just feel so bad, because I want to be able to cook for him and having spent so much time on getting to know this dish and still making it not too well is so frustrating.  It's so from the last century to say this, but it doesn't make me feel to be a good woman/ girlfriend...

Im not good at human relations &amp; I’ve seen some good advice on here &amp; i guess i just want some 3rd party opinions as im in a rather weird relationship stage in my life. 

Im 20(M), been on &amp; off with this one girl for almost 3 years now. We had met right before i left for college &amp; somehow stayed in contact , while we both stayed single &amp; did our own thing for awhile. Feelings were always more 1-sided on her part. I had some heartbroken shit happen to me when i was 15 &amp; have had issues with feelings ever since. Along with my first gf at 12/13 cheating on me &amp; me deciding to stay, ive always kind have issues with trust. 

Now this girl (F19) , has been saying that she loves me for 1-2 years now. Ive always been clear i am unable to reciprocate because i have no idea what ‘love’ is. Now im starting to think i may be feeling that love that i have no fixed definition on because i am separating from her. The reason ive decided its the end is because she had recently confessed some stuff that happened during the summer (last year 2018) where she hooked up with 2 other guys. Which wasnt necessarily what made me upset, i always told her she’s her own free human being &amp; can do what she wants. but if she wanted to interact with me she would always have to be honest &amp; straight up with me. We made a pinky promise during a shroom trip that was based on lies &amp; she perpetually continued to lie all this past 9-12 months for when it suited her personal benefit because she thought id leave if she told me. The thing is , in July which was supposedly after these hookups, she actually had a 3some on a cruise with a couple that invited her &amp; i forgave her because she was honest &amp; told me what happened. Now i dont know what to believe anymore &amp; whether or not all our history is enough of a reason to continue this , i think its the end &amp; it feels like heartbreak buts its weird for me because i havent felt like this in so long. 

Im partially afraid to be alone, partially afraid of hurting her , but mostly just afraid of what state in life im in right now. im broke, average, barely passing grades &amp; now alone after forcing a good relationship to end. I dont know if i should forgive her considering my brain just keeps reminding me of all the instances she lied.  

TL;DR : Essentially, Been lied to for 12 months out of 32 months of being with this girl. She says she loves me, i dont know what love is. I never expected loyalty nor honesty (until 9 months ago on shroom trip we had together).

t2_y9uxd5g,1553876348.0,b6z9yc,t3_b6z9yc,5,"So I've been been broken up with my first proper girlfriend for around 2-3 weeks now, and although it was a LDR, I believe we really did love each other at least at the start, however due to unfortunate circumstances, in part with me feeling like I had been used during some stages of the relationship, we split up, with one of the reasons also being that of me fucking up and doing something stupid at the end.

However, the past few days after we broke up a few weeks ago, I've noticed i haven't exactly been sad about it, and have been spending less and less time thinking about her, although that's not to say that i don't at all, because i seldom find myself getting sad now and again during the course of a day.

​

This isn't the reason we broke up, but it was something that really bothered me when we were deciding on an apartment beforehand, well she was. She broke up with me 3 or 4 times before, the very last 2 times were because I didn't like how she handled things, manipulation, passive aggression, anger etc, and my lease ended soon and I felt in a corner with my worries that she didn't want to work on and said she is the way she is. But I loved her a lot and wanted to figure out a way for it to work, like going to therapy or pointing it out when it happened so she'd stop, anything. But usually her anger came from me being unsure, though that's not really an excuse, because if it wasn't from that it could always come from something else. Looking back on things I wrote about the second to last time she broke up with me, I was saying the same thing, she wouldn't compromise on working on behaving better regarding those issues... and made a weird claim like she's saying I'm ""asking me to submit to you, a man"". Whatever that meant.

​

Anyway, I truly love her and can't imagine being with anyone else... and I've been wanting to do what I can to solve the problems. After all was said and done and we were about to break up, I mentioned that I absolutely didn't like the location of the apartment we both liked the interior of. When I moved in with her at her current place for 6 months, the driving distance is only a 5 minute improvement to the location of where I work, and slighting farther for her... but every day I drive 50+ minutes to work and she drives maybe 15-20 minutes. I've been doing most of the driving to her place to see her for 3+ years. Before I moved in with her, It'd be me that drove to her place 90% of the time, because she didn't like driving long distance because she's from ******** and things are just closer together and you didn't have to drive as far... despite the fact she drives 6 total hours driving back and forth back there every month to see her family. And before that when I lived with my parents, and I drove to her place 99% of the time. I didn't feel like it was fair in the end. I've offered her to stay with me rent free, but she hates that I don't have certain things and maybe not enough room, and not a washer and dryer inside, like she has. Then she asked me, if I'd do all the laundry because she absolutely hates that she has to go downstairs and walk 1 minute to the other building. I told her I could do that maybe most of the time, but not all of the time. She didn't like that answer and said no that could never work. She knows what she wants and likes. She wants the sun coming in from the south, plenty of windows, a balcony, washer and dryer, nice bathroom and kitchen. She like some other things about my place, but laundry is huge for her. She says she's a very particular person, and that I'm not, so we should find a place by her standards. All I wanted was a decent place, decent midpoint for both our workplaces and a good neighborhood. She loves her neighborhood a lot and doesn't want to go far from it. 

​

I can see where her anger comes from, me not feeling secure enough to move forward when she is, but when I feel that way, I usually ask her to work on things or try to point it out. One time we did see a therapist who specialized in something called gottman method or something like that. I felt it didn't do anything because we couldn't address issues, but she was the one who paid for most sessions that time and seemed to like him. One of the issues I ran into myself and should not have done was wait such a long time the 2nd time around to suggest therapy, though I tried to point out when I felt uncomfortable over something. I asked about therapy again a few weeks or so before her lease was ending, I think I had gotten too comfortable with the living situation with her, and put that worry on the back-burner when I shouldn't have. When I finally asked, I made the dumb mistake of saying she should probably go to one, and go alone.... which was dumb to say, and she felt it was insulting, and a little too late to be doing that again. The 2nd time we went to a counselor much later after this, I paid this time. At the time she pretty much said she already decided we weren't getting back together, but I still wanted us to do this because I felt it just had to be done. Nothing changed, though the counselor told us both a few thing each can work on. The counselor was good I think, she was able to address both sides, but didn't suggest too much to solve things, maybe if we had more time and sessions we could have gotten into that, but I know my gf already checked out. She pointed out how my gf would hold onto anger over things that should be small for a long period of time over and not let it go. And she said I had to not say that my gf's behavior bothered me... which actually bothered me because that was like the whole reason I came there to help us on.

Anyway, right now our status is broken up. She's blocked me from text messing her for some reason, and doesn't respond to any other form of communication. I can see her side.. she waited years for me to be ready to move forward. I wanted my own place for a year first, hesitated later because of the way she handles her emotions and anger among some other things I wont get into, then I temporarily moved in with he, then her lease was about to end and her emotions and other things go the best of me when I had to make the next decision. She says the anger stems form my indecision, but she gets angry about other things and I think she makes them bigger than they need to be. I love her very very much, but I had concerns and she wanted to work on those concerns while we lived in a new apartment, not before, because it was too late to work on it before she decided on the lease.

​

TL;DR: But I guess back to the actual question. When couples are moving to a new place, do they usually look for the most middle location between their jobs, and something they both like? Because her drive would still have been 15-25 minutes, and mine would be like 25 - 40 minutes. That's still double hers... and i wanted something in the middle. Later on she said she could compromise by paying for some of my gas and maybe one of the bills exclusively like gas or something, but I felt that wasn't a compromise, it was more like a negotiation for her to get it just her way. She's always saying how she loves her conveniences, and I'm always saying how I like things to be fair for the most part. Even when I tried to make groceries fair she would complain a little. She's a very ethical vegetarian and she wouldn't buy me meat if I needed it from the store ( I was doing keto and that was most, if not all I ate), but she would ask me for things if I was there. I would go along with it, but keep tabs on everything she bought and expect her to pay me back. She understood that, but complained that I always want things to be 50/50 and relationships fall into the grey area when it came to acts like that. Well, usually when i went to the store I picked up something unique or random for her as a surprise that I paid for, so that was my gray area regarding groceries.",relationships,"Me 36/M with my girlfriend 30/F for 3.5 years, Do people usually have problems like this when choosing a place to live?"

The entire time it was always platonic, I never really thought of her any other way and I’m sure she didn’t either - and she’s the type to be in a relationship more often than being single anyway. Late last year I struggled with a lot of personal issues and I (luckily) have a lot of close friends that I can reach out too but this girl was the only one who I told everything too, and being the great friend she is, she helped me with a lot.

Fast forward 4 months to last week (bear in mind, she’s at uni and I’m working - in different countries in Europe), we were both back in our home town and we got together for coffee, hung out etc, but afterwards I genuinely couldn’t stop thinking about her. In my head I thought maybe I just missed her a lot, but then yesterday she came over, we had lunch and watched a film, and it was the same.

If I told her and even if she felt the same way (which I doubt - not being pessimistic, just my honest opinion), it would be long distance right off the bat.

This girl (let’s call her Jane) that I have been friends (but not close) for 4 years told me about a week ago (in person) that she really likes me. It was kinda out of the blue, but not completely, as we had been texting a bit more recently. Perhaps she saw that as a sign of interest. I was perhaps a bit careless in doing that. I find her interesting and generally a great person, but I am sorting out things with someone else for a bit now (though I’m not in a relationship with this ’someone else'), and haven't ever entertained any thoughts about Jane.

Anyway, after asking her for a few days to think about the situation, I planned to get a coffee with her tomorrow. I want to tell her that I do not wish to date her at this time, and even though one can never say never, I do need to sort out other things/relationships in my life right now - as I am going through a major transition in work and personal life, in addition to sorting out things with ’someone else’. 

I am thinking about what would be a good way to say this without hurting her self-esteem, encouraging her confidence and courage for being honest and brave with me and opening up her heart to me, and also affirming that I would like to continue to be friends with her, if it is possible for her. Any ideas/language would be helpful.

Hi, me (19) and my girlfriend (19) have been together for almost 11 months now and something recently happened between us.

My GF told me one of many secrets about a close friend of her and her boyfriend (which I know really well). I refer to this couple as 'couple A'. Last weekend I was drinking heavily with my friends for the first time in a while and told a part of that secret to a friend I trust, who actually has a girlfriend himself that also knows couple A (this is couple B). Now I thought at that moment that it was a great idea to tell the boyfriend of couple B, since I thought the girlfriend also knew. I know it is not an excuse since it wasn't my job to tell but it made sense at that time. Now both members of couple B know it and told my GF about the secret which she knew already. This made my GF really lose her trust in me because she has had some trustissues in the past, and it breaks my heart to have lost her precious trust. We haven't ever had a big fight in those 11months so this is has really kept me awake at night. She is waiting for me to make it up to her but I have no idea how to... I have apologized many times and told her how terrible I feel about it.

I'm asking if you guys have ever had this happen and know how to make this right.

Last night, the daughter of their family friends took her life, and when the news dropped, my anxiety levels shot through the roof and I kinda just closed off for the rest of the night. I had never met this girl, but a few hours before she died, my boyfriend and I saw her getting out of her car to her parents house. (It wasn't until after she died that I found out that that was in fact her). Now my boyfriend and I are both left with a bit of guilt of maybe not going to go talk to her.

With that being said, I just truly don't know how to help people deal with death.

He spends a lot of his time playing video games, bullshitting with his friends, etc. He has worked at the same place since he was 18 (a grocery store) and has moved up into management, however has almost no upward mobility. He has no goals for himself whatsoever. His hygiene has even become horrible... 

He and I got together 5 years ago and have been  close friends since high school. I do love him dearly, there are wonderful things about him and about us as a couple. When we got together, I was a college student and a big pothead as well. However, three years ago when I graduated I got a government job, started becoming more active and had to grow up immensely. He hasn’t had to mature very much. I hate to sound condescending but I feel like I’m living with a teenager at times. He’s messy, constantly getting high and playing video games, and needs to be told what/when to do with a lot of “adult” tasks.. He can also be a complete asshole when he gets drunk (weekly). 

Lately I’ve been talking condescending to him without realizing it, and he’s got upset with me. He doesn’t deserve that. But I’m getting frustrated, dwelling with this grown man who is mentally a perpetually stoned teenager.  

I’ve talked to him about this in a compassionate but straightforward way. He tells me it’s just who he is and I need to deal with it. 

At this point, I am concerned the relationship is doomed. I haven’t really talked to anyone about this because I feel like a massive failure.

March: we [she, 22F] started dating, though I didn’t do so exclusively

Early April: I, 21 at the time, had an intimate relationship with a 16 year old for a few weeks (I know it’s bad, and I know you’ll tell me it’s bad.) this is legal in my state

April: dropped 16 y/o, and me and current gf became official

That summer; I was unhappy with our relationship for half to the entire time, by the end only masquerading in my love for her. She didn’t know and was very happy and in love. She gave me her virginity in a state of me knowingly not loving her, and I reveled in the evil of that.

August-September: my love for her rekindled, but I acquired a sudden need to cheat

September: began cheating with someone I had dated previously. Nothing more than kissing and some tit play/heavy petting.

October: began cheating with 16 y/o which eventually led to sex (I know it’s terrible and I die a thousand times a day when I think about it. Feel free to punish me further. I know it’s deserved.) Days after this, I realized how stupid it was to stay in the relationship, that it was becoming a chore, that it didn’t fit into my plan for myself or what I wanted. I broke it off.

October-November (after breakup): had sex with 16 y/o once more, though I saw her several more times and gave her head once.. She would end up committing herself to someone who actually wanted to be with her. Got into the other girl’s pants once. No actual sex that time or ever. Had sex with current gf once. Life was cool. It was what I had wanted. What I had planned. There was one other girl I had some romantic intentions with. I broke things off pretty coldly saying I felt she was “too young”. More of a mental age thing. She was 18 turning 19, and I was not yet 22. This situation is relevant because, in order to make her more clearly understand why she shouldn’t be involved with me, I told her I was in “intimate relationships with other women”. That night, I considered breaking things off with the other women completely, but the thought of that “burned too much.” It made my soul hurt, the idea of that level of selfish destruction. Current gf reached out to 18-going-on-19 y/o after I told her about it, and 18-going-on-19 y/o replied with the information that I was in intimate relationships with other women, no doubt assuming Sarah was one of them. This is where my kingdom of fire and brimstone crumbled. Current gf saw me the next day and confronted me about it, also asking if I had cheated on her. I told the truth, because lying is for pussies. We got back together. I realized how in love I was when I was faced with the imminent possibility of losing her completely, and that hasn’t changed.

November-December: Things were hard, then okay, then hard, 

January: then I became suicidal because of philosophies of meaninglessness unrelated or maybe entirely related to the negative state of our relationship, 

February: then I went to the hospital, then I had an insane night where I smoked weed at my house and my parents found out and went nuclear and flipped out on me for hours including when current gf came over, 

March: then things got great just two weeks later and current gf and I had the best sex of our life and were so in love and I was putting work into my life and not smoking and taking my medication as prescribed and on my way to working a full time big boy job at the same place as current gf, but then she read a reddit post I had made that week on /r/confessions which I made because I was thinking about 16 y/o a lot (not sexually, just in a very general sense, and I was scared for a moment that I might contact her), and current gf, not trusting that things were as fantastic as they seemed, got on my phone without me knowing and read it. She brought it up on our drive to campus, and I flipped out not because she saw that post, but because of the assumption that she had also seen a post about me and my friend wanting to dp her, which sounds crummy, but I was posting about it on /r/sex to deal with the crumminess, so please don’t hate me for that specifically, hate me for cheating on my gf with a 16 y/o if anything. Anyway, I, embarrassed and ashamed, had no idea how to deal with the mounting shame, so I got unreasonably angry. I told her she had to go home, that we couldn’t spend the day together. But then, on the short drive home, I yelled and drove super quickly and didn’t slow down when she asked me to. I felt justified, like she had read my most private diary, but I didn’t feel that my reaction was fair. I posted to reddit for help, which probably just made it worse because they just had me convinced she was going to leave me and that sent me into a psychotic place. I texted her like a madman about how much I love her. She eventually got back to me and said we’d talk when I calmed down.

Anyway, she wanted to take a break, then she needed to see me so I could hold her, then I said we should take something of a break considering how tumultuous things had been for forever, but days later (today) things aren’t great. She’s talking a lot about leaving, and I know she’s on her last legs. I’m working hard now; I have two jobs and plan to go crazy on schoolwork for the next two days even though it’s spring break right now. I’m keeping my emotions in check and my will strong both to a ridiculous degree, and I even earn many phases of true happiness during my day as a result. She’ll be on a trip with her friend one state over for a couple days. I plan to make her something fantastic, as when I recently asked her how to help her to believe in my love for her, she said actions speak louder to her, and I think a gift that took a lot of effort on top of my coming through on my goal to complete a shit ton of work this break will do a lot to help us.

I also failed the drug test for that job.

Anyway, I don’t need advice, and for this reason I’m posting all of this on /r/relationships instead of /r/relationshipadvice. What I need right now is sympathy or empathy. I know that’s a lot to ask, but I’m human, and even though I’m not worrying, even though I am determined, I’m also stressed throughout me as much as my blood is throughout me, and I’m terrified within every second.

I need a hand on my shoulder, a pat on the back, and a promise that life, that everything will be alright.

Please, Reddit. I’m begging you, and I know I’m so unworthy.

I love you, S. I love you so much. I hope you’ll love me again soon.

t2_agy7aq,1553874551.0,b6ywyy,t3_b6ywyy,12,"This may be long but I'm going to try to keep it concise. 

In my senior year of high school I started dating this guy in my grade. We've been friends since freshman year and have always had that romantic connection but I never wanted to date because I felt too young and I knew that my parents wouldn't approve of it (we both come from different cultural backgrounds). But in senior year I said 'fuck it' and decided to do what I want to do despite my parents opinions. I was even optimistic that they wouldn't even care that much. 

I was wrong. 

Three months into us dating I decided to tell my parents. The moment that they found out his cultural background everything took a downwards spiral. I tried to fight back and make them understand that how they're behaving is so fucked up. They covered it up with ""you need to focus on school, this is a distraction,"" which is bullshit. 

I called them racist then things got pretty nasty. 

When everyone cooled down my parents continued pulling the ""focus on school"" card and there wasn't really a final conclusion. I continued to stay in my relationship with my boyfriend. 

Part of the reason why I told my parents when I did was because I had been extremely secretive about our relationship ever since we started dating (since I knew they wouldn't react well when finding out). This bothered my boyfriend because he felt like he wasn't even in a relationship with an actual person (our primary form of communication was texting). He also hated that I had to lie whenever I was going out to see him, he didn't want me to lie to my parents (although this didn't bother me since my parents are strict as well and I've been lying to them ever since I could remember). 

A year later my boyfriend and I are still dating. With a more sparse class schedule in University we would skip class and he would come over to my house while my parents were gone for the day at work. We did this about once a week to see each other and spend time together. 

One day my dad came home while my boyfriend was over at our house and I lied and said it was a group member from school. I walked my boyfriend out and the truth quickly came out. My dad was furious because I lied to his face but that anger was also directed to my boyfriend. 

My dad and I fought which led to my dad ignoring me for an entire month. 

We never spoke of that day again. Which still haunts me because I have so much to say regarding it. 

I also never had my boyfriend over to my house again because taking the chance wasn't worth it.

My boyfriend and I had our two year anniversary this past January. We've been making it work even though its been so fucking difficult. I feel bad for him and all this shit I'm putting him through to be in a relationship with me (not being able to see me as often, having to drop me off at the end of my street just in case my parents see, not being able to come over etc.). I've met his parents before and they know about me they're just weird with having a girl over at the house which I respect. 

It all just sucks because I don't win either way. I'm thankful for the relationship we have but he and I both know this relationship feels so far from one. Calling him my boyfriend while writing this even felt weird because I'm so used to referring to him as a 'friend' to my family or saying I don't have a boyfriend when they ask. 

Recently my boyfriend brought up taking a break for a few years and waiting until things are better for us (when we're moved out, more independent etc.) and I think it's a good idea but it fucking sucks. I just wish I could have experienced this relationship without my parents being a factor to many of our problems.  

Right now my dad is home all the time from work which makes leaving the house freely near impossible. Usually we would get lunch together and I would be home before my parents got home so I would avoid all who, what, where questions. So things are only getting worse between my boyfriend and I.

I don't really know what I'm looking for here. I know all the answers, I've received so much advice about this. He's my best friend and I love him. I know I'm young and this is my first relationship so I feel like there's a lot of other aspects to relationships that I should be learning and focusing on while dating but I feel like my parents are getting in the way of it all. 

TL;DR My parents are racist towards my boyfriend and even though I have fought multiple times, their opinions haven't changed and it's beginning to affect my relationship with my boyfriend. ",relationships,My (19F) racist parents are fucking up my first serious relationship.

I think she is a very strong woman who has been dealt the short end of the stick a lot and done (what she thinks is) the best she could with the circumstances she’s had. Unfortunately, I’ve always been the person to suffer the consequences for the choices she’s made. She couldn’t afford to raise three kids on her own, so she stayed with the father who abused me. My brother had obvious mental health issues since he was young, so she put my needs aside in order to focus on his (imo she failed him too in this regard, but that’s another story). She was having a difficult time in her life with caring for her mother with Alzheimer’s and losing her social support system, so neglected my care when I was recovering from a brain injury and used me to vent all her frustrations. Those are just a few examples, and I can absolutely understand her actions, but it just always sucked to be me growing up. I am also the oldest of my siblings, and have some reason to believe she resents me for “sticking” her with my dad, so she has never been as warm or supportive to me as she is to my siblings, particularly my brother.

I moved out of her house three years ago when I got engaged, and soon afterwards a lot of family drama blew up and I started decreasing contact. My fiancé, who does not like my mother and believes she’s very manipulative, advocated for me to cut contact, but I didn’t want to mostly because of my sister who is 17 and still dependent on my mother. However, six months ago I decided to cut contact after a disastrous visit home that started with everyone “lovingly” making fun of me and taking cracks at my sexual orientation (I’m a lesbian) and ended with my drunk brother screaming at me to “get out of [his] life” and my mom defending him on the grounds that he just quit smoking. I decided I didn’t need that in my life and have had extremely limited contact with my mother since, and only as it pertains to my sister (she also has mental health issues and a budding drug problem so I’ve wanted to stay in the loop about that). 

Now here’s my dilemma: when I told my mother how I would be reducing contact I stressed that it wouldn’t be forever, but I needed some time to heal and be away from her and I couldn’t do that while talking to her. She’s.... honestly varied in how much she’s respected that, but in the last few weeks she’s come to me multiple times offering to talk things out and saying she misses me and wants to be part of my life again. I haven’t yet answered her because I don’t know how. I do love her, and miss her, and I did tell her I wouldn’t cut her off forever, but honestly the longer we don’t talk the happier I am. Since cutting her out I’ve moved across the country, gotten a job I love, started seriously looking at going back to school (after feeling too stupid for school for years due to fights she and I would have), and am just generally happier and more confident than ever before in my life. I’m afraid that inviting her back in will open me up to sliding back into my old, less confident and happy self. I’ve also realized that there were a lot of ways in which she never treated me with respect that I didn’t catch before.

I’m considering telling her that we can talk occasionally only if she follows a set of ground rules, but I don’t know if that’s a good idea or really what those ground rules should be.

tl;dr went extremely limited contact with my mom six months ago, we miss each other but my life is better without her so I don’t know what to do.",relationships,Several months ago I went very limited contact with my mother. Now she wants to fix things but I’m happier without her in my life.

My worry is that I've become a bit fixated on this friendship and I'm terrified that I'll leave 'friendly', pass straight through 'clingy' and into 'creepy' or 'viable taser target' territory without spotting it myself. 

I've already spotted behaviour that concerns me, but that I seem unable to control: things like constantly asking if she wants tea or coffee; offering to give up snacks that I like if she's hungry; opening doors for her; getting her coat at the end of shift; asking if she's ok all the time; being so nervous on her behalf when she has to be assessed on anything that I get the shakes in my leg and other weird shit like that.

So far she has been very understanding and kind, having been warned by my boss and friends that I was a bit weird.

t2_22sp5jen,1553860108.0,b6wabs,t3_b6wabs,1,"  I met my SO when I was working on... let's call them Ken (27M and Barbies (22F) wedding. The three of them all come from a neighbouring country, and Ken and Barbie had just moved to my country and town for studies. The first year of my relationship we were long-distance, and I started hanging out with Ken and Barbie as well. We got a long greatly, but most of our friendship was based upon me constantly helping them with things, from small to big. I helped them with the language, with bureaucracy, with housing, having a place to sleep and shower, hosted one of them when they had a marriage problem etc. At some points I tried to tell them that they can just Google the information themselves, but they kept on insisting that I am great at googling (I really have no idea what that means) and finding the correct information. We had a few fights about politics which has gotten a bit heated, but we share the same core values.

 Now my SO moved here in September and he is slow to make new friends since he is working so much, but he has Ken and Barbie and they go way back and they play in the same band together. It was all fine until one day Ken sent me a link to an article about RFID-chips that one can put in ones hand. Now we had already agreed to not talk about this because it got heated, so I thought that maybe he had changed his mind. I simply commented that I thought it was an interesting article, but it was wrong about how it said that it makes you always on the grid.
  I shouldn't have responded at all.
It all turned into a huge fight, and they compared me with Nazis for being neutral about the technology in itself and said that I am for enslaving humanity. I think technology can be used both for good and for bad, this goes for RFID chips as well. They said that they would never want to be friends with me if I got one and that they wouldn't even want to hear why I got it, which made me very sad and upset. It ended with them saying that they don't want to be friends with me at all, and I wrote back that maybe I don't want to be friends with them either. Barbie even told both me and my SO to fuck off. This was in November.

During this time I was going through a depression, still not completely out of it and I have had many bad news and situations to deal with. This of course made things much worse. Due to this I was unable to do some obligations I had, I had promised Ken and Barbie to send some e-mails for an anarchist organization they are trying to start since I am better at handling authorities, probably since I am not an anarchist myself but happy to help. I had no idea how to ask them if they could do the emails instead because I had to much else to deal with and we weren't on speaking terms. In the beginning of January Barbie messages SO to ask about the emails and my SO explained the situation, so now they got mad at me once again.

I honestly just want to have the situation done with since it is taking such a toll from me right now and I keep on cancelling or having to drop out of things because they will be there and they keep on throwing me guilt that I would make other people uncomfortable by showing up because they refuse to talk to me. I have suggested that we all sit down and at least come with a plan on how to be in the same room as each other, but they both say that they are not ready yet. I have also told my SO that even though I know he is in a hard situation, I wish that he would stand up for me and tell them that they were out of line. I know I did wrong by not asking for help with the e-mails, but dealing with depression, my father in law being in the hospital for surgery, my brother having a psychosis, I had problems with getting out my salary and this, the e-mails were frankly on the least of my mind for that time which was a little over a month. He said that he feels like it is too late for him to tell him that since it has happened such a long time ago, but for me this is something that is still happening. He is mad at them trying to get some people they know to sleep at our place for a gig that I can't even go to, because they are there but hasn't really been able to talk to them about it yet.

The only thing that gives me comfort in this situation is talking to other people who has had the same problems with Ken and Barbie, who keeps on loosing friends because they have a very low tolerance for people having different opinions.

How can this situation improve? Is there any hope for it to improve?

Tldr; Had a completely unnecessary fight with my SOs only friends in town which ended up with us not speaking, I failed to keep a promise to them which I was supposed to do after the fight.

t2_1lgkcpda,1553872637.0,b6yjdx,t3_b6yjdx,7,"To start this off, I want to immediately clarify. I feel as though I'm the one putting in almost all of the effort into the relationship *BUT* I feel like I'm wrong about that at the same time and maybe I'm just going too far out of my way and putting in *TOO MUCH* effort. I have these issues so far in the relationship and I'm not sure how to fix them or not feel empty when they happen and I'm looking for advice. I know it might seem like I may be nitpicking, but I promise you that I'm just trying to find a solution to my feelings and I do *not* want people to justify my feelings. And I absolutely do NOT take any of this out on her. I'm still afraid to bring up these issues with her in the fear of being screamed at, or gaslighted.

My girlfriend and I have been together since October, and we've come across small issues here and there. We don't typically argue but we do come across things we have issues with and just talk it out. First relationship I've ever had where screaming or breaking/shutting down wasn't the main factor in arguments so that's been a nice change of pace.

However... I've felt like I've been the one putting in all the effort in the relationship to make it function and I'm the one who tends to have issues with things. She's very mellow when it comes to the relationship, independent, and basically doesn't need me at all. While on my side, I'm filled with anxiety of cheating/bringing up issues because I'm afraid of losing her and getting screamed at when I have no grounds to feel that way in the relationship. She doesn't yell, doesn't visibly get upset, hasn't cheated or lost my trust, nothing. I'm just a paranoid mess. That isn't to take away from the issues I have but it's good background to have.

* She doesn't respond to texts well. Basically, zero effort and doesn't bother to read anything if it's more than 2 sentences or over 6-7 words. She'll open it, look at it for a second, not respond. I can text her literally all day. Her responses are maybe once an hour, up to 4-5 hours at a time with one worded responses. Almost always.

* When she's upset, she completely closes me off emotionally and just like I'm afraid of getting screamed at, she's afraid of opening up to me. It's always been like this and she came from pretty awful relationships just like me.

* When I need her to be there for me emotionally, she basically can never be. Her reason is that she just couldn't handle it. I don't know what this means. Even if I'm upset or completely ready to give up on life, I still try my best to be there for her.

* She dodges spending time with me sometimes, other times she's absolutely ecstatic to be around me any moment she can. I don't understand this and I want to, but I don't know where she's coming from with it.

* She's dealt with a lot of physical, emotional, and sexual.. violence from her family with a history of drug addiction. I don't know how to overcome this or if it will forever be a burden on her shoulders.

* She randomly snaps when she's emotional like quick burst cussing and putting emphasis on things. In the moment, they aren't really deserved but I also understand she's under a lot of pressure. It just catches me off guard and I don't understand.

* Nothing is ever of urgency, ever. Versus me, it absolutely always is urgent no matter what the situation is. We clash with time management. If she wastes 30 minutes, she'd rather just call the whole day a bust and do nothing versus me where I want to go as soon as humanly possible.

* I feel unstable. Pure and simple. I feel like I misread everything and that I'm just emotionally unstable.

t2_3i26ijxd,1553840202.0,b6trm7,t3_b6trm7,10,"This is going to be a long story so I already want to thank everyone who takes the time to read it.

My boyfriend and I, both in our mid 20s are together for four years. There has been an issue with a female co worker of his for over two years. He hang out at her house in secret 1.5 yrs ago, I found out much later. He claims nothing happens. They still work together and text sometimes, but less frequent. He swears he won't hang out with her - she has send inappropriate texts and such.

We live together in our own house. I leave every monday morning to another city and come back thursday morning for work issues. This means he is alone for 24 hours.

This thursday morning 10am I got out of the bus and saw that girl walking to the bus. We live in a small craphole place, with nothing to do. We have a supermarket, a bakery, one tiny clothing store and that is it. This girl lives in another city, works in another city and studies in another city. I know she has NO friends or family in our town, because she mentioned it earlier to my boyfriend. (""You are the only one I know that wants to live in that crap place!"")

What was her reason to be there, so early in the morning? I came home and my boyfriend was in bed asleep, with the window and curtains open. He always sleeps with the window and curtains closed. Also his jacket lay on the floor near the door. We live together for 4 months and his jacket never laid on the floor before.

I confronted and he said she was not there and has never been to our house. Then I decided to check his internet history. Yes, fellow redditors, I know this is wrong but I do NOT want a rant about this - I know how much Redditors want to burn alive people who do this. I checked it. It was a mistake. I know. Please no rant about how bad it is or how my relationship is doomed already.

So I saw that the evening before he watched some netflix on his tablet until 11PM. After that, things get weird. He watched youtube on his mobile from 11.00 to 11.19 PM. This is odd, because I am with this guy for 4 years and he NEVER watches youtube on his phone when he is inside the house. He always only does this when he is in the bus, outside or whatever. However no busses drove at that moment so that can't be true. After 23.19 there was no signs of activity anymore on his phone, tablet or computer.

He set up an alarm clock at 22.59 PM. 

The first next activity was next day 08.04 am when he put off his alarm clock, and then 08.30 on Whatsapp.

He has a car that he shares with his mom. Wednesday we got into the car and he said; Mom keeps asking bout the car and drives my fuel till its empty. And I said; no she didn't asked for the car for at least 2 weeks why you bring this up? He just said oh it bothers me.

He kept bringing up this girl a couple of times. ""I don't think it was her, I think you saw it wrong. Probably can't be her"" blah blah. 

So, fellow Redditors. What do you think of his behavior and signals?

t2_ebe7s,1553869391.0,b6xw0r,t3_b6xw0r,3,"I moved away for college and have moved around since, but never back to my home state in the midwest. So I don't see my mom all that often, maybe once every 3-6 months. We have a pretty close relationship -- we talk on the phone once or twice a week and I'm always excited to spend time with her when we can. However, for the past year at least (maybe longer, but I've notice it over the past year), whenever we spend time together she drinks A LOT. Like I'd estimate 1-2 bottles of wine. Casually.

My dad's a recovering alcoholic -- he's been sober for 10 years. But you can imagine my childhood was pretty chaotic until I was probably 15 (because the first year of his sobriety was also really tumultuous). I'm definitely extra sensitive to alcohol use and abuse as a result. I drink in moderation (like 1-2 drinks at a time 1-2 days a week), but anytime I go overboard (especially in college) I have a lot of anxiety about addictive behavior and turning out like my dad.

Anyways, she came for a short one-night visit recently and my aunt (her sister) and my younger brother [17M] joined. The four of us were hanging out and playing board games. My aunt and I had a couple beers each, but my mom got hammered. She couldn't follow the game we were playing even though it's one she plays all the time. Then she quit the game and sat on the couch, where she fell asleep at 7:30pm. They were all in an AirBnb and I went back to my apartment at 9:30 and didn't get to say goodbye because she was totally passed out.

Of the three times I've seen her in the past year, this has essentially happened every time. I've tried to bring it up before, but my mom totally minimizes it. She'll just say ""oh, I'm on vacation! I'm not normally like that."" So I'm like whatever, she's an adult she can do what she wants. But I talked to her on the phone today and she apologized for ""going to bed"" so early and said it's because she woke up early that morning. I was like ""yeah, that was it."" I honestly don't think she remembers how sloppy and visibly drunk she gets, but it's pretty bad. Especially in front of my little brother, who is already starting to experiment with drugs (weed) and alcohol. My mom's being such a bad role model.

I really don't know how often this happens, but the fact that it does/has multiple times makes me think it's a pretty frequent thing. So how do I approach this with her? My mom does not take criticism well at all and is very sensitive. She also has that problem where she refuses to believe any information that doesn't align with her worldview. And in her worldview, she's an amazing, balanced, healthy person (she eats well, exercises, is really good at her job). I talked to my other brother [22M] about it and he suggested I frame it as ""I hardly ever see you and when you drink that much it doesn't feel like a real visit because we can't have an actual conversation, you go to bed so early, etc."" I liked that advice, but I'd love to hear others' opinions. Thanks!

t2_22734pbk,1553855110.0,b6vjsa,t3_b6vjsa,12,"English is not my first language, so sorry for any mistakes.

Backstory: I was 18 when we met, he was 21. Everything started great, I really liked him and trusted him a lot from the very begining, since I was new to relationships and naive. About 4 months into the relationship he started acting strange,he was using abusive language towards me (saying I should be happy he is with me since no guy will ever like me and so on)  he was refusing sex, acting hot'n'cold towards me, demanded that I stop hanging with my guy friends, lying about pretty much everything. He never hit me but he did hold me so tightly when arguing that it would leave bruises on my arms. He never had time for me, but when he wanted to be with me I had to be there for him. Also he wanted for us to have a baby after just 6 months of dating while not having our own place or regular income.  All those reasons combined were why I broke up with him after dating for 11 months. After that we were broken up for 4 months and since he was begging me to return, saying he is going to change and that he is seeing a therapist for his issues with anger and that he loves me, I returned (I know, I was naive).

In  the past week, after being back together for 2 years I found out he was lying about pretty much everything-his work experiences (saying he was a rally racer), hobbies (lying about playing instruments, practicing judo), past relationships (lying about dating girls he never dated, lying about not dating some girls he had dated), money (saying that he had savings, that he borrowed money to friends when it was the other way around)... I fell in love with the person that doesn't exist. Not only that, I found out he cheated on me with at least 2 girls. Yesterday he took some girl on a trip and I would not know if his friend didn't tell me. Boyfriend lied that he has to work late, while in reality he was done at 3 pm, picked up that girl and drove with her to a place 2 hours away and back.  They did this so that no one who knows him or me would see them together. After I found out I called him and asked what he was doing on a trip with another female so far away. He got mad saying that he hasn't seen her for half a year and that they went together on a  trip unplanned and that it was one of those  in the moment decisions and that he would tell me after he would go  home. After my call with him, he called his friend, who was the only person that knew where he was going, and asked him if he had told me and  that there was no way I was going to find out on my own.  Then half an hour later he texted me that I must be keeping secrets from him too and why did I call him about it and if it was my intention to get him mad. I didn't respond and then he texted 2 more times, blaming me for making him mad.  Next day in the morning he texted and apologized, saying she was just a friend and he never hooked up with her and never will. I also found out he is in debt, the problem is he  earns a decent amount, but never has money or anything new, so he is probably spending his money on other ladies and then borrowing money so he can still get through the month. Also he does not know I know that he cheated in the beginning of our relationship too.

He was my first love and I still care deeply, but I am very hurt and confused. Especially since we were talking about moving in together and starting a family in a few years.

I don't know how to go from here, should I get my stuff from his place and cut all communication or should I try to talk to him about cheating?

We've bought a 1930's house in the UK and the room with the toilet in has a hole that goes to the outside wall (I assume for smell ventilation).

I've spoken with various tradespeople about how to fill it and most of them suggest expanding foam. This seems an OK idea as the products say they insulate very well (it has to cover a brick cavity wall type wall). It seems like a lot of foam for one single area.

Is it best to brick it up instead? Or is expanding foam fine?

The master bath has the exhaust hose just laying on top of some insulation. While it’s running, I don’t feel any airflow at all coming through. 1) I assume there should be some flow to be felt?

The guest bath fan has no hose connected to it at all and was blowing into a pile of insulation. I wasn’t able to check it for air flow. 

2) can the two of these vented through one roof vent, or do they need to be separate?  They’re only about 6’ apart.

3) our roof is only about 6 months old, so I don’t know that I want to be the one to drill holes through it. If I were to outsource this, is it a job for a general contractor or electrician or what?

4) again if I did outsource it, what might a loose ballpark cost be? Or a bare minimum maybe?

I've been brainstorming and wondered if it was possible to add decoration to wooden floors via a carving piece. Not like a few scratches into the actual floor board, but like someone cuts out a square in the ground and places in a carving piece and then seals it all up so it's level. Something like this for example. What are the cons/your thoughts on this? What might the process look like? I can't seem to find anyone who's done this - it may be a little extreme.

Backstory: Me and “Katie” had been friends since we were 12 she moved away shortly after we first became friends. While she was gone we stayed in contact, it was very cute we would write letters and talk on the phone every night. 

She eventually moved back around five years ago and we were just about inseparable. We always had a good time no matter the circumstances and she treated my family like her own and sometimes go to my mom for advice.
Around two years ago she dropped a bombshell on me. She called me and told me she was in love with me and was interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with me, I was in shock and didn’t know how to respond she said that we could still be friend and she would let me think about it. Time went by and nothing was ever really said about it since that day. She eventually got with a guy and she found out she was pregnant.
For the first few months of her pregnancy she was fine, I would even go with her to some of her doctor visits (her boyfriend dipped out). Things got crazy though.

She started saying stuff along the line of “we better start hanging out a lot because once I have the baby I won’t see you for a long time”.
She started getting upset with me for the smallest things. On her birthday she was sick and we didn’t get to do anything, she stopped talking to me and started ranting on Facebook about how she doesn’t have any real friends. I asked her about this and she claimed “I’m never there for her like she is for me” which isn’t true because I’ve always tryed my hardest to be there for her no matter what. I just decided to apologize and try to make it up to her even though I felt hurt by this. 
I ended up taking her out to eat on me and things where fine for awhile up until her baby shower came around. I tryed to get out of going to work which didn’t work so I let her know and told her I would make it up to her by taking her out and buying her and the baby something. She got mad and blocked me on everything and I hadn’t spoke to her since.

Fast forward to now it’s been a year since I’ve spoken to her and she texted my mom yesterday saying she wants to come out and let my mom meet her baby soon. My mom said of course and she went on to say “I know you know now I don’t talk to “Julie” (me) no more so if I could come when she’s not there that would be great, She makes bad choices so I would rather her not meet my baby”  this was like a knife in my chest. I honestly don’t even know what she means by I make bad choices. I don’t drink and I’ve never done any drugs and I have a everyday job. It’s not like I’m some crack head. My other friend has a child and I’m around her all the time so I don’t understand why she would say these things. If anyone knows why she would act this way please let me know because it’s really bothering me.

Tl;dr my ex best friend of 12 years got in contact with my mom after a year of not hearing from her and told her she wanted her to meet her new baby but not me because of my bad choices.

Bestie went back to abusive cousin she's been secretly dating, and she has a history of staying in bad relationships/family that do the same. What do I do?

***To clarify we both live in the US where dating cousins are strongly taboo, but it isn't so in her family's culture/country of origin.

Anyways, she went radio static with me for 2 months saying she was too busy with school and work to stay in regular contact like we always have, so I give her space when she insists she's OK. A few days ago she calls me saying she found out she had a cousin from an uncle that was disowned from the family, and she felt bad so she talked and eventually hung out with her cousin. He soon started acting like he was dating her, and she said she went along with it. And appently he was talking with his ex in the mean time which she was mad about. Anyways he posts that my bestie and him are dating on fb and she confronts him in her car since she had told him she didn't want to go public about them dating and now she wanted to end things. He doesn't want to and starts yelling at her and grabs the steering wheel causing the car to swerve. She was shooken up about it. Anyways when I told her she was lucky she got out of that situation safetly, and that she should stop seeing him period she agreed fully. She lives with her parents and not with him to clarify.

It's been like 2 days later and today she tells me she's in a relationship with him and it's public on fb???? Like even if she can somehow disregard how horribly people look on cousin relationships in the US and how strongly people will judge her, the dude is pure trash and trouble. I even posted warning signs of an abusive person on my timeline yesterday and she liked the post.

Her mom has been in an abusive relationship with her dad for decades, and her sister got back together with her abusive ex. I'm worried she will follow the same path... Especially since she was hung up on a guy who cheated on her 3 times and still went back to him each time (despite me constantly encouraging her and telling her she deserved better) until he chose his baby momma over her and blocked her.

Tonight there was a get together for someone who was leaving and two of the people I get along with well went and the others I’ve only spoken to sporadically. I usually sit there and try and listen and take part when I can but sometimes feel awkward when I don’t say anything for a few minutes.

I have social anxiety in general, so mixing with new people is not a strong skill of mine, I’m worried about saying something stupid or saying something I think is funny but don’t incase others don’t laugh or whatever.

Seems daft right?

I’m naturally a fairly confident person, as I say I get along well with the guys who work there aswell as the waitresses (one of who’m is ridiculously attractive) normally my anxiety would stop me talking to her but we have a good laugh.

I have tried to make efforts into saying we should start to plan to move in together and he always agrees but action is never taken on his side.

However, in the summer he started on a new medication for anxiety and ever since, his libido is almost nonexistent. Basically, since July 2018, our sex life has plummeted.

Their fights and her constantly bullying my dad didn’t get any better as we grew older. She would throw tantrums but my dad would patiently deal with her. Eventually, my dad lost all of his friends, his family (she fought with all of his sisters and brothers and now no one talks to my dad and mom) and he lost something more important: his children. 

The last time I called my dad, he begged me to call him everyday. I didn’t do that. Somehow we just grew apart. 

As an adult, I grew up to be just like my mom. I m guilty of using manipulative techniques, saying mean and hurtful things, to all my boyfriends in my past relationships. No wonder I’ve been in so many failed relationships! 3 years ago, I finally moved out of my family, got a kick ass job and started living on my own. I realized that I was capable of being a very different woman. I am capable of loving, being compassionate and not using toxic language. 

Therapy has helped me analyze my toxic behaviors and handle them. My boyfriend (27m), god bless his heart, has been extremely supportive of the whole journey. 
 
Last night was the last straw with my mom.  She has a habit of triggering me and my brother with our worst insecurities. She got mad at me for deciding to  sell my car and said “Mike told you to do that? I’ve been with you for so many years and you met this mike 4 months ago and now you’re listening to him? How stupid are you? Mike will leave you sooner than Jason did” 

I don’t know why but I have been crying since 4 am today. Crying about what my therapist told me. That in someways I’m exactly like her. Crying about how she’s made me feel like I’m unworthy of love. How controlling and manipulative she’s been. How she separated me from my father - a man I truly admire. I just feel so lost and helpless. 

Tl;dr: Grew up with an insecure, abusive and crazy mom and it has made me a toxic person. I am weeping with regret, fear and I am helpless. Just needed to vent. Thanks for reading! 

Edit: Mike only suggested I sell my car. He helped me make a budget as I might be moving to a more expensive city. Yes I did listen to him and I am giving up the car. Heck it’s my car.

He feels like he can't do the things we wants to do like code and play video games because I'm there and the weekends feel unproductive. He said it puts him in a bad mood. We do go out and do things together, go for walks, brunch but he thinks our weekends have become too routine. He wants to be able to do his own thing (like spend all day coding) while I'm there, and spend a couple hours of the day with me. He said if things continue the way they are with having to spend all weekend doing things together he's going to crack at some point.

t2_3081gnzt,1553843494.0,b6u5xu,t3_b6u5xu,5,"32/M here. TL;DR: There are a couple friends of friends of mine who've added me (or whom I added, it was years ago) on Facebook, but act a little strange on there. I get the sense that they have zero respect for me and are just abusing our connection. My question is, is their behavior actually toxic or is this all just in my head?

The background:

For example, I'll post something on Facebook which, say, gets a bunch of likes. Most of my actual friends will either like my post or comment on it. These two twats won't ever comment or like the posts directly, but whenever an attractive female friend of mine comments on a post, they'll like/respond to \*her\* comment with a goofy, flirty sentence and a wink emoji. It's as if I only exist as an avenue for them to mack on my female friends, and it seems highly disrespectful and even like a subtle but intentional diss to me.

Is this all in my head? Because this sort of behavior seems to happen like clockwork from the two or three dudes in question. They've also done a variety of other shady things that I'm totally not a fan of. When one of them was rooming and playing ""best friend"" with one of my other friends, he started manipulating my friend and my friend's girlfriend's relationship and eventually stole my friend's girlfriend. It's as if he has zero respect for friendship boundaries and he's just out to get whatever he can. He's also acted disrespectfully to me in person (and his girlfriend later apologized to *me* for *his behavior*).

I've started removing such people from my social media, once it's apparent to me that there is a pattern to their behavior. Is this over-reacting? I don't want there to be any dramatic fallout, since we have mutual friends in common.

I'll try to spare unecessary details. I'm in a college intern program and have worked in this law firm for three months. I basically am an assistant to every lawyer in the firm, and I'm the only intern, which makes my job pretty hectic. All in all, I love the job and I think similarly the people I work for hold me in high regard. 

I'm in a committed three year relationship that I have recently realized hasn't been doing it for me anymore. However, it is my first relationship and I feel like I have arranged my entire existence around him and our plans for the future. While we get along fine, I have realized I am no longer feeling the same way I used to now that the honeymoon stage has dissolved. Basically, I'm really confused about what I want. 

Onto the affair. He caught my eye from afar shortly after I started working there. Nothing beyond just a thought of how he was hot, and no intention whatsoever to pursue him at all. I knew he was married and had a couple of young kids (although he is miserable in his marriage). I'm not the kind of person who pursues people when I'm interested, I wait for them to come to me because I'm kind of shy (annoying, I know). He also is super conservative and I am extremely progressive. Most importantly, I have never thought about cheating on my boyfriend before and didn't plan to. Just kind of admired him from afar and treated him with professional courtesy. 

I stayed late at the office two weeks ago and he was around. No one else was and he lingered when he saw I was staying. I noticed he had been trying to make conversation with me recently and thought he might be attracted to me. I'm basically the only young woman at the firm and so I just shrugged it off as male horniness. Anyway, I ended up in his office and he made his move and we had sex there with the door closed. 

We both were filled with regret. I cried that night. But I kept coming back to him. I'm at work as I type this and feel a rush of excitement every time he walks past because of the scandal of it all. We hook up in his office almost every day. 

I'm a fluctuation of emotions constantly. He literally has pictures of his kids and wife in his office when we fuck.  My boyfriend is so fucking nice to me all of the time and I feel like I'm his entire world. I don't know what to do. General advice needed.

Okay so I met this guy online around 6 months ago, on an online game. And he was very VERY into me. Like he was full on. He told me he was in love with me before he saw my face.... after like a week lol. Anyway I’m not sure about that but when we exchanged socials he literally said I was jaw dropping and beautiful etc etc. I say this because it’s important. 

Anyway things continued to be very intense and I fell for this guy. I only got the confidence to start video chatting him like a month ago though. :/ it took me ages because I was really self conscious. Anyway, it went fine etc etc and then he asked me to be his boyfriend. 

Things continued to be intense and then I guess I felt him, idk; pulling away a bit? But I figured he was just busy and stuff and left him to it. He started saying he was feeling kinda weird and couldn’t spend so much time on me but continued to reassure me he was insanely in love with me and all that. He was going out and stuff. 

Anyway..... and I’m not proud of it, but I randomly google searched him the other day. I don’t even know why. I’m sorry. Legit cyber stalking. I just had a weird desire to snoop. 

And I did NOT expect to see his profile on hotornot, a dating site come up. Made RECENTLY, ie when we were together. Bear in mind, it’s weird enough that came up on google, and things were “amazing” apart from me feeling him pull away. When we did talk he was just as intense and loving as ever so I never doubted his feelings. 

I of course confronted him. His reasons varied along the lines of
* All my friends were doing it
* I wanted the self esteem boost. If certain types of girls like him it makes him feel good about himself. 

He basically admitted he was using this while telling me he was too “busy” for me. For even a phone call. 

I got SO upset. I was devastated. Why am I not good enough to give him a self esteem boost? I show him so much love and think he’s amazing. 

He refused to delete it and then made me feel awful by telling me that his ex used to do it with him?? He used to tell me his ex was HORRIBLE and cheated on him so it kind of hurt to hear that she’s more laid back and I’m just being overly sensitive. 

I just don’t know why I’m not good enough? He genuinely acted like I was the most amazing woman on the planet.... was it because I video chatted him and he doesn’t think I’m attractive enough? Am I just not pretty enough for him to feel good?

I know he’s shady with his intentions behind creating it. It was while we were together and he must KNOW it’s disrespectful but he refuses to admit it. He just tells me it boosts his ego and he needs it. 

He even has the nerve to tell me that it would improve our relationship because it makes him feel good about himself having hot girls think he’s attractive. 

What can I do? Is this a sign I’m just ugly and not even attractive enough to make someone who loves me feel good about themselves? Is it because I misled him or something?

I have $15k+ tied up in all the building/renovating.

Always needing to shovel the mailbox out. Anyways, the crux of it is she always has her horses to attend to before work and at night. Now, I normally even help with watering. However, when it comes to the house always I have to take care of it. Practically my part-time job. If the tractor, laundry machine, etc breaks. Snowblowing. Getting Firewood. Doing dishes. Sweeping, any new renovations, etc. Once she’s done with horses and work, she’s already too exhausted to do more (I also care more about cleanliness). House is always a mess if I don't do anything. We communicate decent enough but I’m the one free here during the day, and if something needs to be done or I can’t stand it any longer I do it.

Throwaway jic.

Mainly three people involved: Me, C (her) and M (a mutual friend, 22F).

\[Background\]

I first met C when giving introductory briefings to different groups of freshmen for my major in college. She was in the final group of freshies which I had briefed and I had extra time left over, so I stayed with them a little after talking about academic stuff to open up more candidly about college life and things they should consider. Gave all of them my number in the event they wanted to contact me for anything and didn't think much of it, since I had done the same for previous groups briefed.

Somewhat surprisingly, she messaged me and we began chatting. Apparently she found it nice to talk to someone that didn't just talk about academics. Alright, that's cool - out of all the freshies I had passed my number to, she was the only one that actually texted and wanted to talk about stuff other than school. We hit it off over text and decided to meet up for a meal in school, which was nice. Learned more about each other's interests and found that we were more alike than I thought. Given that she would be considered conventionally attractive and she tends to prefer talking to guys compared to girls, it was also natural that she already was in a relationship, but I was fine with that since a few of my close female friends are also attached. As long as everyone's mature and both they and their boyfriends are fine, I'm good. And so the friendship continued for a semester as we met up once a week sharing about how our lives were. She had some trouble finding a community within her current Christian campus group and I invited her over to the one that I had been in thus far, thinking that it would be a good way to help her make the genuine and real friends she said she wanted. Along the way, I roped in a friend of mine called M who's a year ahead of her in the same major, thinking that M would be a good 'older sister' of sorts to C even after I had graduated. So the three of us began meeting up in a group and both of them got along very well, which was encouraging.

\[Issue 1\]

Things seemed fine until about a month back (halfway through the second semester), when I had arranged for a jam session with C. I've always been interested in music and enjoyed jamming with my friends, but there was an unfortunate tendency for people to only agree non-noncommittally (i.e. ""Would you be interested to jam together?"" ""Yea, sure, sometime."" And when I suggested a possible time, their interest in jamming suddenly declined. I suppose they liked the idea of doing it in general but not specifically liking it (or me) enough to set aside time to do it.) So when I found out that C was also interested in jamming, I was understandably a bit cautious. But after checking with her a few times after, she was (or seemed) sure of her genuine interest, and so we arranged to jam on a Friday evening after class. I booked the college's music room a week in advance, packed the instruments and was prepared with chordsheets while checking that 1. she was alright jamming even if it's just two people 2. she could make it on that time. Both were affirmative up till at least Wednesday. We didn't meet on Thursday (when both of us would usually meet for lunch) or Friday (when the three of us would meet for lunch) because of other issues, but I trusted she would turn up on Friday at 5pm (the time we had agreed to).

I came home and took a nap. Woke up at 4.30pm and received an ad-hoc cancellation text from her saying that she couldn't make it because she wanted to have dinner with her parents that night.

Trust issues from being burnt by flakes in the past aside, I felt a mixture of emotions ranging from incensed to hurt and confused. But alright, sure, family over friends. Through our conversations I had learned she had a strained relationship with her parents and this seemed like a step in the right direction, since it sounded like her parents really cared for her. It was a bit of a bummer that it came at the cost of my meetup with her, but whatever. I explained to her over text that I was blindsided by this, but that she should just enjoy her dinner with her parents. And she replied that she was sorry for not being able to make it, but didn't understand why it was such a big deal for me.

I complained to M about what had happened and she suggested I perhaps had too high expectations of C. Strangely, M also told me that C had told her of her inability to meet up with me when they had met at 2 (since they had classes together), and M, knowing that I had been looking forward to the jam session, asked C if she had told me. And C replied ""Uh, not really."" And so M badgered her to tell me that she wouldn't be able to make it since M knew how disappointed I would've been. So part of me wondered whether it was normal to expect someone to keep to their word especially when they had given it a week in advance and kept confirming it, but, y'know, maybe an emergency happened that deserved a cancellation 30 mins before we were supposed to meet.

A week after that, I did get a chance to meet up with C and asked her what happened. She explained that her Dad had gotten back unexpectedly good health results from a recent check-up, and so he wanted to celebrate. Sure, alright, that sounds fine. I guess that couldn't have been predicted a week in advance, but whatever, water under the bridge. The right thing for a Christian to do is to forgive, and so forgive I did. I thought that was the end of it.

\[Issue 2\]

Boy, I wish that was the end of it. We haven't met on Thursday for some time, and I thought she probably didn't want to meet up or talk one to one anymore. Sure, I don't mind being the wallflower while she and M talks on our usual Friday lunches. So I asked both of them if they would be free to meet for last Friday and they both replied in the affirmative. Again, up till the Thursday before, both confirmed their attendance.

I got a seat first when M came shortly after. I said 'Ah, I guess C woke up a bit late', but M looked awkward. Then she said 'Actually, C just texted me to say she wouldn't be coming for lunch today.' 'Oh, why, she's not feeling well or doesn't feel like going to school today?' ""Er, not really...she said that she didn't feel like having lunch with you.""

Hurt and perplexed would be apt descriptions of how I felt, since things had seemed pretty normal up till then. But I had a nice lunch with M and we talked about various things as usual. So I went back and thought no more of it, since it seemed pretty sure that C just wanted to stick to M and didn't consider me a friend anymore. I've seen enough friendships run their course to know when someone's already checked out of it, but I still wanted to extend an invitation for a talk on Tuesday to C. Sent it on Monday and received an affirmative reply from her.

Surprisingly, C came towards the end though M and I thought she wouldn't. But she was in a rush to leave early and when I asked if she would be free for a meetup on either Thurs or Fri, she replied that she was busy and probably wouldn't be able to make it.

\[Issue 3\]

After conversing with some friends, I sent a text that night explaining my understanding of how things had been and how it seemed she wanted to return to being acquaintances instead of friends. She replied, and we had a long conversation about what our ideas of friends were. I can't paste URLs here, but this pastebin (La293RpR) has a rough transcript of the conv. It pretty much left me feeling that we were more different than alike in how we treated our friends. I'm not sure how else one might interpret someone saying 'I don't want to meet with you' unambiguously, but if someone says that to me, I'll assume they mean it and act accordingly to consider the friendship dead.

""So what are you posting here for, then? Isn't this dead in the water, another friendship that's ran its course?""

I'd be happy to move on and return to being strangers with C, but M reached out to me after I shared what had happened with her and seemed to encourage me to stay in the ""friendship"": ""Yeah, I think I understand where she's coming from. I think it's really important not to place expectations because everyone is very different in how they interact and I think I get how she possibly felt a bit overwhelmed when she is busy and you asked her about her situation. I know it's hard but you can't expect her to be accountable to you for every action so its best to give her some space.""

Part of me wonders when I had ever asked for a full account of her actions - I don't ask her what she's doing everyday and I have no reason to do so. I only ask what someone's plans are if we've agreed to meet up to see if we can schedule around it or not, and if they can't make it for what we had agreed to prior, I  just want to know why. Even if they can't suggest another time to meet, telling me the reason would show that they at least cared enough to give a reason/excuse. But when C didn't turn up in Issue 2, she hadn't even texted me of her cancellation but told M instead and just assumed I would know she wouldn't be coming and wouldn't care about it.

Right now, I'm writing this post for a third opinion to see if I might've made a mistake in having these expectations of someone I considered a friend. The general consensus I've gotten from some of my friends is 'Yeah, C sounds like a bitch/someone that doesn't know how to care for her friends because she's attractive and so she wouldn't feel the loss of friends because there'd always be guys trying to befriend her' but I'm not sure if that's necessarily being fair to her. As per what M said, it could just be a mismatch in expectations because two of us had very different ideas of how we relate to our friends and what we expected of them. Advice on how to proceed is also welcome: I'm tempted at present just to return to being strangers or bare acquaintances with her (and explain to M why), but I don't want to push things towards a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Thanks!

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 6 years. When I met him in highschool he was in his first year of college, and he was a “bad boy” type of thing. Didn’t realize the red flags because I was so in love with him. 

We drank a lot when we first met, when we went to parties together and when I stayed the night at his place. I didn’t think much of it because we were young. Now, the drinking has been a huge issue. It has been throughout our relationship. 

I would also like to mention that my parents both had problems with drinking when I was a child. They would get into explosive arguments. They are not that way anymore and are both so in love, which I feel like contributes to my staying in this relationship because I feel like my boyfriend and I can work this out. But their problems with drinking is also is a trigger for me, I literally hate drunk people because of this. It might be important to also mention his parents don’t drink. His mom has never had a lick of alcohol in her whole life and his dad hasn’t had a drink since college. His 3 sisters do not drink either. 

There’s a couple other things that worry me when it comes to our future, but I’m just going to stick to the drinking. We talked about the things that worry me literally last week, and I brought up the drinking. I told him it really makes me question whether or not I want to stay in this relationship, which I have said many times before. He said he would try really hard to be good about it, but here we are. 

We’ve had crazy crazy fights while he’s drunk. The problem is once he starts drinking, he doesn’t stop. This happened last night. 

My friend had an event and there was an open bar. My whole friend group was there and we were all drinking, I had two beers and felt fine, while my friends were all pretty drunk. 

My boyfriend kept asking the bartender for double shots of tequila. After a couple the bartender said he couldn’t do that anymore, and told my boyfriend if he orders a drink he can get another as soon as he’s done. So my boyfriend gets a margarita and literally chugs it in 5 seconds (really embarrassing for me because this was an important event and here he is chugging margaritas). Then he gets another. I got upset and told him “you don’t need that drink. You’re already really drunk”. And he just said he would be good. Well I started talking to other people and I guess he continued to drink at the bar. Now, he’s shit faced. And when he gets drunk like this he becomes a raging asshole. It makes me angry just thinking about it. He is so mean when he’s drunk like this. Anyways we were going back to our friend’s house so the girls took an Uber and the guys took a separate one.

All of a sudden we get a call from the boys that my boyfriend got them kicked out of the Uber for fighting with the driver. Apparently the driver was asking our friends if my boyfriend was going to throw up in his car, my boyfriend called him an asshole, and the guy kicked them out. 

When we got back to our friend’s place it was a total shit show. He started arguing with me and just saying really mean things. Talking so negatively about everything and was making everyone and everything his enemy. Then he kept switching back and forth between saying sorry and saying fuck you, which happens often when he gets like this. 

I was so embarrassed; all of our friends were dancing and having fun and here I am fighting with my drunk asshole boyfriend. 

This morning he woke up and was apologetic and embarrassed. I didn’t say it was okay, I was really mad and told him this is the last straw (which I have said too many times about these instances). We hung out a little and then I went home. I’m still extremely upset.

He has seemed depressed lately and I know this alcohol might be an addiction. But I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to breakup, but I do at the same time. I just can’t bring myself to do it. Our friend group is literally like the show Friends, and we’re a group of 5 couples, 11 people (one 6th wheel). I worry that us breaking up will separate this friend group that I feel so blessed to have and never want to lose. Also, this sounds stupid, but my boyfriend got me tickets for Christmas to go see Paul McCartney in July which is literally my actual dream come true, and I won’t ever have the opportunity to see him again, so I don’t want to ruin those chances. My boyfriend and I are also generally good and happy when the drinking is not involved. 

I don’t know what to do. Is it fair for me to give an ultimatum, me or alcohol? I wish he could just stop drinking overall. He won’t admit that it’s a problem enough to go to AA, he said “it’s so humiliating to go there”. 

Can anyone offer some advice? Has anyone gone through something similar? Thank you in advance.

Thank you everyone for listening. This is quite different to what usually is posted here so please bear with me. 

I met a Christian guy (i’m Christian too) a couple of months ago on a dating app. He lives in another state and we’ve generally been taking things very slow. He was in my state for a couple of weeks when we first met where everything seemed fine. I decided to then fly over to his state (present time) for a few days to see him and explore at the same time. 

Now, problem is, he seems too comfortable already and we’re not even dating. I know he wants to be in a relationship with me (he has told me) but I said we need more time. First annoying habit is, he can’t stop singing. In public, in the bathroom, when I’m sleeping (8am) in the morning, everyone looks at us and I feel embarrassed. I’ve told him nicely to stop and or try to do it less but he won’t listen. Another thing that is annoying me is that he farts around me. I find it very disgusting as I’m not that comfortable with/around him. He will go outside but let’s me know what he’s doing which is even worse. I said that this bothers me as we aren’t even dating and that he’s becoming too comfortable. He responded by saying that it’s normal and gentle man like for him to go outside and fart. 

Am I being too insensitive? I’m starting to feel like we aren’t compatible. I’m also starting to feel that as much as I wanted this to work, it won’t. 

Thanks guys

t2_3i17s980,1553831269.0,b6sl6z,t3_b6sl6z,11,"Hi everyone,

I'm really seeking advice on this matter. I'm (29) dating a wonderful man (42) who's divorced with two kids, we have been together for more one year now. His ex-wife has full custody of the kids. We see them every other week. Sometimes the kids stay over for a couple of days (not every week though), other times he just drops by his ex's house to help put the kids to sleep, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

On the surface, I'm ok with this arrangement because I can see that their current relationship solely exists for their children. But sometimes, I feel so angry at the fact that he still has a relationship with someone he once built a life with, was intimate with, had feelings with. They separated around 3 years ago and the divorce was final last year. They have had this arrangement for years before I came into the picture. 

&amp;#x200B;

His ex-wife is also dating another man that stays over her house every weekend. I have met her and her partner as well. It's important to note that his ex-wife is lovely and really has not done anything rude/mean to me personally and always teachers her kids to respect me, i.e buys me cards, makes the kids write letters for me, teaches them to say thank you to me for helping out. She does not really call my boyfriend but they do text everyday I am assuming for the sake of their children. However, I know they talk about each of their relationships and seeks advice from each other. I know he has helped her with some advice but not sure if he talks openly about our relationship to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I just go into moods where I cannot accept that I'll always come second, not a priority and that his family of four (though divorced and broken up now) will always come first. I don't want these feelings to ruin my relationship and I don't want to seem like the immature one. But some days I give him such a hard time. I become rude, insensitive, give him the cold shoulder for something he clearly is not wrong for. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also get mad when thinking about the fact that he still has photos of his ex-wife and kids around the house. He says it's for his kids but I still have days where I can't accept it. I understand the photos being in the kids' room but in the common areas? I still can't comprehend that especially when the kids don't stay with him most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I love him and we get along great but I'm not sure if we are compatible in this matter. I am thinking of seeing a therapist to come to terms with these feelings because I believe he is worth it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to know is, is what I'm feeling normal since the relationship is new or should I walk away now because it is something I just cannot accept? Maybe consciously I can, but subconsciously, I'm not sure.

I have an older IKEA table (not a desk), which has screw on legs at each corner of the table. The screw on legs are screwed into what I would call a ""rail"" or ""bar""; this rail/bar is about 1"" in height, and leaves  about 1/2"" - 1"" of trim (I will take a picture at home, but can't find anything on google atm to show this; essentially there is smaller frame on the underside of the table). 

The problem is the clamp needs about 3"" of depth at the edge of the table, and I only have about 1/2"" - 1"" due to the rail/bar. I was going to do an exact measurement of the height of the bar (~1""), cut out a shim to fill that gap, and then clamp the mount to the shim, bar and tabletop. But part of me thinks this might not be the best idea, or it's not a very solid construction. I'm sure this is a somewhat common issue, but I had trouble finding an answer/solution on Google. (The obvious solution is buy a mount which already fits your desk, but I was not going to buy a free standing mount as it seemed to the defeat my purposes of ""saving space"".)

I am not going to drill into this table, as it's a table and only a ""temporary"" desk -- when I buy a new desk I intend to make sure it won't have a ""lip"" like this table does. But until then, I'm trying to find a temporary solution!

I hope I am using the terminology and the follow the subreddit rules right, and please feel free to correct me! Thanks!

EDIT: I'm starting to think that, instead of cutting one block to fill the gap (both depth and height) and clamping onto both that block AND the frame/bar/rail, it might be better to construct a piece which would go over each side of the rail, and create one flat surface for me to clamp onto (i.e., it would be shaped like a U and just go over the frame completely).

Just a quick question, I ordered this doorframe earlier and had it delivered and upon unwrapping it found it to look like the picture linked.

[My door frame.](https://imgur.com/kIObThd)

Am I wrong in thinking that this is faulty or that something is missing?

For instance, the black stuff up the left-hand side of the frame is the weather stripping, the plastic bar across the bottom has the ""mushy"" weather sealing side facing the same way, so it's obviously intended to act as a seal also, the only problem is it's about an inch away from the rest of the sealing material and the stops and unless I rabbet the bottom of the door, this thing is just going to cause the door to sit about an inch away from the frame when it shuts which isn't how I think it's intended to be.

This frame comes with the cil preinstalled, it's just that plastic bit that seems funky...

Started removing the carpet 3 days ago only to find dried green cracking lanolium under the carpet... ok... cracked a few pieces off and boom more even older lanolium that is gray under that.

I check YouTube for ideas on how to get this off but I wanted to know if anyone has a good way to get this really old lanolium out. It's so brittle it breaks with just a bit of pressure.

That board plus the tile will add an inch of height and that would be a huge jump from the hallway height. It would also probably interfere with the bathroom door opening and closing.

From the very few videos I could find on YouTube that were actually pertaining to the work, it looks like you just cut a hole in the ceiling, frame it out, drop it in, screw it in. Same with attic fan, except run some electrical for the motor. 

Is that really all there is to it or am I missing something? We had a contractor come over for some stair redesign, and just mentioned it so he threw it in the quote. He said the attic stairs would cost just under $1000 in labor, not including materials, and the attic fan about the same. I understand contractors are paid for their knowledge and labor. I’m not disputing the cost. I’m just thinking that if it’s as “easy” as YouTube makes it out to be, I’d like to try to do it myself.

My ex-husband (with whom I cannot completely avoid contact because of our two kids) always has an opinion and a need to voice it. He makes assumptions about me and judges how I spend my money &amp; live my life. 

——

For the record, about three months ago I landed a fantastic job that I love. This job has enabled me to provide for my kids and myself in ways I haven’t been able to in the past. (Little things, like being able to actually save money)

I have taken the high road through all the bullshit he has put me through in the time we were married and after our divorce, but lately he seems to have gone off the deep end. We have always maintained a mostly friendly relationship - peppered by his flip-outs. Since quitting his traditional full time job, he now works for himself and spends most of his days alone watching conspiracy and alt-right videos on YouTube. 

Despite being in debt, out of shape, barely self-employed, and a recreational drug-user, my ex-husband has an opinion on everyone and everything. The stuff that comes out of his mouth is racist, judgemental, inflammatory, and downright crazy. It’s his way or the highway - an undiagnosed obvious narcissist.  

We are divorced. We have been divorced since 2011. Yet he still makes comments and passes judgement on me, to me, in my face. 

He has opinions on how I spend money, how I dress, and who I am friends with. I usually ignore him, but I find it hard to just stand there and listen to him say blatant lies to my face. Tonight he commented on a pair of earrings I was wearing - earrings I have had in my ears since 2014; he insinuated some man bought them for me. 

I am just at a loss on how to respond to him. Do I defend myself? Do I explain? Do I ignore? It’s absolutely enraging to be around him anymore. 

The obvious answer is to just not be around him, but because of our situation and co-parenting, never being around him isn’t an option. 

I need help.

Recently my mom came to visit since I had to be hospitalized (I’m ok now). A package from amazon arrived this morning for me; the package in question was a gun controller for my PlayStation VR headset. She has been going all day about how violent games are evil and how I’m wasting my life away doing nothing noteworthy of it. How I’m still immature and how I should stop “my little games”. 

She’s been pretty hurtful about it too, comparing me with others from my generation that are now homeowners and / or married (IMO it’s easy to be a homeowner when costs are 8x lower in your hometown compared to a big city such as where I live). 

She also says she’s dissapointed I spend so much time on my phone, even when I tell her I’m actually replying to some important conversations, which she doesn’t believe I have. 

No matter what I do or say I’m a failure when compared to others my age, or at least that’s today’s argument.  She says I’m living in a ”virtual unreality” and that my depression isn’t real but rather caused by my hobbies. 

She’s a great mom otherwise, but she won’t accept my hobbies (even though nowadays I indulge in 5 hours a week at most on games due to work / excercise) and won’t be happy until I stop.

t2_3hwvhprp,1553826231.0,b6rt7f,t3_b6rt7f,1,"My friend uses reddit, so throwaway and changing some information. Also, sorry for my poor english. I've been best friends with Rachel for 8 years. We met online and never in real life. However, we are each other's best friend and tell each other almost everything. 3 years ago, Rachel met Mike (30M) online. They started talking and eventually started a LDR. Mike lived in a different country, and my friend and I live about a 4 hour plane ride away from each other. It was a very passionate and toxic start with them crossing some boundaries that screamed red flags. About a year into their relationship, things started to get kind of weird. She stated that she and Mike were ""one"" and to respect the fact that her relationship with him has become like this. I was confused and angry and tried to talk to her about it. Mainly, I was trying to get my friend back and understand what the hell was going on. I didnt get through to her. Eventually, Rachel dropped hints that Mike hated me, but I've never actually had a real conversation with him before. We started getting very hostile, with her disagreeing and fighting everything I said.  I asked her what was going on and why she was fighting with me, and she told me that Mike didnt like what I said to her about their relationship. She also told me to talk to her as if I was talking to both of them since now they were ""one."" I felt attacked, like an unwarranted 2v1. I tried talking through with it to her, but nothing worked. I gave up and felt like there was no room for me. I stopped talking to her for almost a year until she messaged me again in late 2018. 

She apologized to me and told me she realized how unfair the whole ""we are one"" thing was to our friendship. In the year we stopped talking, She told me nothing has been going well for her since we've last talked.  She immigrated Mike over to our country, paid for all the fees and processes, and got married to him. He managed to get her to cut off all her friends, including ones shes known for over a decade. She got in countless of fights with him before she found the courage to message me again. He told her that I was a bad person, and was not supportive of us talking again. Every time she wants to chat with people, he hovers over her and gets upset that shes spending time with other people. He tells her he doesnt want other people to hear her voice (??????) And ""cant trust"" males around her. She defends him by saying hes just overprotective, and that it's part of his personality. There were several times when she would be playing an online game with randoms and he would get upset, pound on tables, rage quit, etc. 
She likes to leave the house sometimes to go shopping or hang out with friends, but hes stopped her from doing that as well. I had intentions of meeting her in January when I flew to her state, but she couldn't leave the house. She tells me it's because shes scared to see me and I never got to meet her. I suspect Mike prevented her from leaving. 

She has gained significant weight from depression, nearly twice her healthy weight. He makes Rachel cook for him because he doesnt like the food that her mom makes. In addition to working full time, she would have to come home and cook him pizzas, fried food, and unhealthy stuff. She hates wasting food, and has a history of binge eating so she essentially eats dinner twice. 

He's staying with her at her mother's house, and makes it hard on her since hates her family. It's been almost a year since he arrived and he hasnt shown any indication of finding a job. He spends her money and makes excuses after excuses about the fact that hes unemployed. While i can see how it's scary for him to start working after immigrating from another country, he has shown no urgency to be helpful. Stating that they dont have to worry about rent, and are not living on the streets, therefore he doesnt need to work. 

She slowly revealed all of this to me over the course of 5 months since we started talking again. The past two days have been her opening up to me about how shes unsure and how shes depressed with the whole situation. Shes heavily implied she regrets marrying and immigrating Mike, and recognizes what he is doing is abusive. However, she feels like she needs to stick with it since she's done so much already. 

I feel completely helpless and I want to do something, Shes like a younger sister to me. I am several states away, and starting saving up some money so I can pay for her plane ticket and hotel to come visit me. Is there anything I can do that could actually help?

I simply don't have time to talk and I also don't think it is my responsibility to act as a therapist for them. Besides that, I just generally don't feel the same way about them as they do about me.

She complains that I don't give her enough attention and don't let her know that I still love her and still want to be with her (with words or otherwise), and she's right. During my work day, I don't feel like texting her most of the time. When we talk on the phone, sometimes it's a nice and fun talk, but sometimes I just really want to hang up. What makes it worse is that she's living in a different place, sad about being away from family and friends, and I don't give her 1% of the support I should.

I went to visit her last month and we had a wonderful trip and really enjoyed each other, but on the last couple of days, I just really wanted to come back and couldn't stand being there with her anymore. During my first weeks back I gave her more attention, but it faded.

We've talked many times about how much I don't behave like a supporting and loving boyfriend, and I always promise to change, but it just doesn't last. I always come back to not giving her much (or any) attention during my day, putting work and other stuff before her. She thinks I might not care about her or not love her anymore, and even though I tell her she's wrong, it does make sense to me. I feel something really bad, really deep when I tell her I still love her and still want to be with her. A voice inside me screams ""Lies!"" when I say that and try to reassure her, which increases my own doubts. Sometimes it even feels like physical pain at those moments, but I still can't bring myself to be honest with her.

I made the mistake of distancing myself from my friends after beginning this relationship and I worry if I would be able to reconnect with those friends or make new close friends. On the other hand, every day I stay with my GF, I fear that I'm making it even harder to make (or re-make) connections with other people. My GF is not very open to me spending time with friends or work mates, mainly because I dedicate so little time to her. When she was here, it was also impossible to hang out with other people for that same reason, even though we were together 100% of the time. Because of all this, I have a deep fear of being lonely for the rest of my life.

Also, I haven't told her about a few things that I know would bother her: having a beer or two with work mates sometimes, telling her if there are any women there with me when I hang out, and telling her of the existence of a new coworker (26M). 

The worst of all is that I think I've developed feelings for this new coworker, and I fear that my decision to break up might be influenced by that, and I know it shouldn't. The fact that we're on the same team doesn't help, because I spend most of my workday with her (and get along really well), and it also might make my feelings a bit unethical. I know I shouldn't break up a long term relationship with the intent to seek another woman, and I think this coworker wouldn't be interested in me romantically anyway. But I also feel that if I have developed feelings for another woman, maybe my current relationship is doomed. Maybe that means I really don't love my GF anymore.

The fact that I'm thinking about this other woman all the time (really, all the time) can't be a good sign.

I only have a few days before my GF buys the plane ticket to come back home, and I feel the need to be honest and stop fooling her and myself. I know that I admire her a lot and love her family, and that she loves me with all her heart and wants to stay with me forever, which makes the decision even harder.

Me  (35F) and my partner (42M) are in an LDR and have been for about seven months. We visit regularly, have a very experimental and satisfying sex  life, and are very open with each other about our sexual histories. We  are extremely close and, I believe, honest with each other. We both work in the music industry and are out and social a lot, as well as  working with quite attractive people, and I have never felt any sense of  distrust or jealousy at all. Our relationship is really great.

A  few days ago, he went out to an event and posted a photo of the outing  on his social media. For some reason, my gut really reacted to one of  the women in the photo. She is attractive, talented, etc - not unusual  to the types of people he works with and networks with at events - but  something in me just flagged this person and I'm not sure why. I went to  sleep, telling myself I was just being silly.

But  the next morning when we talked, and I asked him how the night was, he  went on to say that it turns out he will likely be working with this  person and helping her with her new musical project at the request of  mutual friends. I was flooded with the same sort of worried confusion,  and this time it was paired with the fact that the two of them are in  very separate musical genres and it makes no sense to me that he would  be either a) interested or b) even asked to work on a project so  different from what he does.

Something  about this is really making me feel unsettled. It felt like it was  simply a lame instinctual reaction at first, but then the next morning  the information I was given really did not help. I am not a jealous  person generally and I am not sure how to react here. Am I being  ridiculous? Should I ""listen"" to what my gut has been feeling and allow  myself to keep an eye on this interaction, or should I shake it off and  not worry? Literally nothing more than the above has happened and yet I  really am feeling notably odd about this. It's weird for me to feel so  strangely based on so little.

t2_3i0jus8c,1553823778.0,b6req9,t3_b6req9,5,"This is long and convoluted, but I am desperate for advice.

I’ve ruined two of my closest friendships. These people were like family to me. I am struggling with depression at the moment, which seriously compromises my rational thinking, but I know it’s no excuse for my behavior. And I’m trying to make an adult decision here on how to make their life have the least amount of pain for the next three months.

Earlier this week I was at a low point, and really paranoid about things. I had taken an Ativan to calm down but it wasn’t helping, it just made me feel more empty. I made a really rash decision and texted them that I wanted them out of my life so I could start with a blank slate. I don’t know why I did this. But this upset them a lot, and it was clear from their text this was the end of our friendship. They told me to keep the stuff of theirs that I had and that they would be delivering my stuff shortly. 

I spiraled down from that point. And I need to describe my mental state. It’s hurting me to write this, but I got drunk and went into the forest behind my house with a rope. I’ve tried to tell myself that it wasn’t intentional, or that I was just being dramatic with myself, but I made sure my pets had food and water for two weeks, so I need to be real with myself. I sat in the forest for a while and then chickened out because hanging yourself is painful and then went home. Instead I took a bunch of Ativan and drank more. I changed into a nice outfit and laid down in my bed, really expecting to not wake up because I thought Ativan+alcohol=death. But I woke up the next morning. I was really remorseful, and I guess I had already texted them while drunk beginning them to forgive me, and that I was so sorry for the terrible thing I said. They were adamant that we would “talk later” about it, which I really think means the bridges are burned.

Anyway, these friends are married and one of them had a key to my safe that has a shotgun in it. I gave it to him because I didn’t trust myself. I have been trying to sell it for a while, so when I woke up that morning and still wanted to die, I texted him and asked if he could put it in his mailbox and I could pick it up. I think he assumed I just had a buyer, but in any case, he actually drove across down to deliver it (and another thing he had of mine) to my mailbox.

I was going to just end it but IDK, I broke down and called another friend (who isn’t as close to me) who talked me down and I ended up checking myself into a psychiatric hospital. They only kept me for one day, because I wasn’t honest about them about my plans and intent. I just told them I didn’t feel safe around myself. This was partially because I have no money, and I gather that even with insurance it costs about $1,000 a day to be hospitalized. I just wanted to be stabilized until the shotgun was gone.

The problem is, the wife is my emergency contact and medical power of attorney. My family is abusive, my brother joined a cult, which are other stories, and she agreed to this about two years ago. When I say we were as close as family, I really felt like we were, she was the closest thing to a sister I’ve ever had, and he came damn close to being a brother. So they called her, even after I told them not to. She calls me at the hospital and is very kind, wanting to watch my pets and telling me that she loves me and is scared for me. I tell her she can’t help me and to not be scared and that I’m sick and that my friend is taking care of the pets.

Once I was discharged friend and I sold my shotgun, and the suicidality was gone. The wife has continued to send me kind messages on messenger, I apologized for the hospital involving her, etc, she tells me that I’m not an imposition, and that they want to be there for me, etc.

But I know I’ve hurt them and I know the reason they are doing this is because they are good people and they feel it is their duty to preserve human life. They probably wouldn’t do this for a stranger, but I don’t imagine anymore that they like me as a person, or want to have a real friendship (or family?) with me anymore, just based on what transpired.

I go to the same gym as the husband and wife. It’s actually where we met. Wife doesn’t come a lot, husband does. I went today, to both classes, because it’s just so fucking lonely at home, even though I told myself I wouldn’t go to the session he goes to. I apologized to him in person, he said, “OK,” walked a few steps away and, “We will talk about it later.” As I turned to go he asked if I was OK, and I nodded.

I don’t want to interfere with his enjoyment of the gym, and he was so fake with me in the gym until we were face to face (like, we have a line up where we shake hands), that I know me being there must be a stressor. And I can’t take back what I said. I can’t normally go in the morning at all, only in the evening, when they go. And I’m trying to make the choice if I want to stay away from the gym for the next three months, so they can enjoy it in peace. They are moving in three months, so there’s that. But I this gym is the only thing that keeps me motivated to live, and there’s not another one like it in town, and even if there was, I’d be among strangers. (Everyone at the gym is very close to one another.)

Some background - I am a 25 yo white, American female who has been dating a 25 yo Indian (Gujarati), American born male for 4 years. I love my boyfriend very much but unfortunately my patience is running thin with the state of our relationship and clashing cultural differences. 

My boyfriend and I met in college 5-6 years ago. We were friends at first and started dating at 21. We were roommates (parents didn’t know) together with a bunch of people and started growing close and then started dating while living together. After college we moved our separate ways physically, him back with his parents and me independently. We’ve been semi long distance for 3 years  and I only see him about once a week for a few hours since we have to sneak around. 

Problem: my boyfriend is still financially dependent 100% on his parents. He is trying to look for a job but hasn’t had any luck. Because of this dependence, I feel like his parents control him and I’m growing resentful of them. For one, he has STILL not yet told his parents that I exist or that he’s dating someone. We’ve had many conversations about this and I get the cultural implications of it but it has been 4 years so I’m increasingly frustrated and growing impatient. I understand the beginning because of the no dating in Asian culture piece, but we’ve been very serious together for a couple of years now. Because his parents don’t know he’s dating, we have to sneak around. He can’t go out too often because he gets screamed at by his parents. When he does go out to see me he lies to them so he feels bad. We plan on telling them about us next month, but I’m scared he won’t stand up for me when/if they disapprove as he hasn’t shown he can yet. He’s afraid to stand up to them as he thinks they’ll kick him out and cut him off. Im afraid they’re never going to let him come over or see me. He convinced me to trust him that he will stand up to them when he makes money, but I find it so hard to trust and believe this. I’m 100% financially independent, have been for 3 years, and ready for the next step in our relationship. We talk about this and he is ready too mentally, but not ready because of his life instability. You can bet he can’t catch a break from them because of this instability. We’ve been stuck in this limbo for so long and we fight constantly about it because he doesn’t believe he’s being controlled and is frustrated being pulled all different ways. I try as hard as I can to be supportive but I feel I have cut him so much slack and am annoyed at our relationship since it’s so abnormal. He’s assured me time and time again that he would never accept an arranged marriage but you never know. 

Please offer any advice or similar experiences. I love him so deeply he’s so kind and funny and sweet, but this I feel this is ruining our relationship as my anger and resentment grows. I honestly don’t know if it’s worth staying anymore.

Currently we live about 2 hours apart but my lease is up in June and I've been talking about moving up closer to him. Not moving in together specifically (at least not initially), but we would live minutes apart instead of hours.

&amp;#x200B;

About a month ago I brought up the whole moving situation while we were talking and double checked to make sure he was still OK with it. He said yes and that he tells himself that if we break up at least I'll be living in a city I love (vs. the city I live in now, which I hate). The statement struck me as strange at the time and I told him I don't even want to think about breaking up, that I'm moving so I can be closer to him. After that I brushed it off and time went on.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I was spending my off days with my BF at his place and he told me about a dream he'd had the night before. He said that he'd been walking at some sort of shopping center when he came across me walking hand and hand with another guy and had become really upset. I kind of giggled at the moment and joked asking if he thought I was going to leave him and he sad yes. That he was certain I was going to find someone ""better"" and leave him eventually...

&amp;#x200B;

I was stunned. To give some background my BF has had some pretty traumatizing relationships in the past (he's been cheated on, taken advantage of, abandoned for an old BF...) and is convinced he somehow isn't good or important. That's part of why he won't move in with me as well. He's convinced that if that happens everything will fall apart (because in the past it has). However I also know that he wants to believe a good relationship is possible again, but his mind makes him doubt it.

&amp;#x200B;

After he told me about the dream I told him enthusiastically that I love him (true) and that at this point I have no plans to leave him. That if that's what I wanted I wouldn't have fought so hard for our relationship when we were on the break....but he struggles with believing me. I can tell it. Now these last couple weeks he's been kind of distant and I'm not quite sure what do to. Does anybody on here have any advice on what I can do or say, actions I can take to help him facilitate trust again, or trust in me? I know each person is different and has to come to their own terms, but I'm curious if anyone has any ideas for anything I can do specifically.

We're fully intending on getting married, but we both agree that we want to live together for a little bit before getting engaged. He has a well-paying job that he enjoys, in a city that is close to both of our families and our friends. We both love this city and could see ourselves living long term here, even if we aren't together. Jobs in my field in and around this city are scarce, and even fewer of those jobs don't conflict with my values. The thought has occurred to me that we may never be able to live together while having jobs we both like and commutes that don't make us soulless husks, since full-time remote work in my field is still relatively uncommon.  
I'm getting to the end of grad school and, without thinking I would get the position, I applied at a company 3,000 miles away because they work on exactly what I want to work on, the position sounded invigorating, and they said that ""remote work might be considered for well-qualified candidates"". Fast forward a bit, they want to hire me (part time at first while I finish writing my thesis, and then full time once I graduate). From the interview it sounds like they would want to keep me out there a bit, but that working from the city my partner lives in ""wouldn't be out of the question"" in the future. My potential future boss even encouraged one of his employees to move to Japan and work remotely to be closer to his family.  
I'm going to talk with my university's career services once I get the offer and talk with them about how I might be able to negotiate a pre-determined amount of time (I'm hoping a year) that I can work full time on site before having the option to work remotely. My partner and I both agree that having a definite end date for our LDR would make things significantly easier. The issue is that if they can't give me that hard time cap, I'm not sure what to do.   
This job seems like a really good fit, and my partner supports me taking it, but I don't want me leaving for some potentially indeterminate amount of time to damage our relationship. On the flip side, if I don't take this job, I worry that I'll be filled with regret in the future.    
If I do take this job, it could be one of the only paths to us being able to live together in the future while both having fulfilling jobs. I've already cried a bit just thinking about being that far away from him for that long, but I've also jumped up and down with glee that I might be going on this new adventure to a place I've never been before, to create a better future for both of us. I want this job, but I also want to be able to have a good relationship and not force my partner into a too long LDR situation. 

My questions are thus: What should my partner and I seriously discuss before I decide on this job? Are there any unforseen factors I might not be accounting for?  How do people make these big decisions anyways? What is your take on the situation/what might you do? 

TL;DR: There's a job I want that's 3,000 miles away that could be the key to us living together with fulfilling jobs in the future, but I'm not sure how long I'll have to be away, and I'm worried that it'll be unfair to my partner or bad for our relationship.

Just imagine a bunch of comic books, nerf guns, and action figures all around the room with empty cardboard boxes stacked on the shelves. He blames himself for not helping, but he honestly can't.

I tell him that I'll make it all better and try my best to organize everything and he doesn't have to worry.

Admittedly, she's pretty much my only friend. It's hard to make friends as an adult and when I first moved to this new city about a year ago she was one of the few people to show interest in hanging out.

We've both been through rough childhoods and other rough traumas that have heavily impacted us. It's nice to have someone who is aware of how unforgiving life can be sometimes. But just because she's basically my only friend at the moment it's not going to deter me from potentially walking away.

She's very my way or the highway and she knows it. I'm not sure if she's working on it or not though. She's done a lot of things that have disappointed me and continues to do so.

I went through a depressive episode a few months ago and texted her, ""can I come over? I've been feeling really depressed lately.""

She replied, ""Oh, honey, it's not a good time right now."" 

And then didn't text me again for like a week and a half. Not even to check on me.

She's flaked out on plans we spent weeks talking about. She's lied to get out of things and then admired to it later. She won't drive to my place, she always makes me drive.

She's criticized where I am in my profession. 

She's given me a hard time about accompanying me on certain trips out I didn't feel comfortable/safe doing alone at night.

She's just not a very good friend. But I've never said anything because that's just her. I know to have low expectations. I just let her live her life. I (stupidly) expected the same. But no.

The reason why she's stonewalling me right now is because she wants to add one of her friends to our bowling team. I initially said no, because I already feel overwhelmed with the amount of people already on our team.

She doesn't know that though. Because she kept cutting me off to yell at me and wasn't listening.

She then said, ""We're not talking about this right now,"" gave me a fake smile and stormed off to bowl her frame.

It was really creepy and unsettling the way she did it. I felt like she was trying to pull rank or something? 

I didn't feel like she could basically just tell me, ""discussion over."" So when she came back I continued talking about it. Then she through a *fit*.

She is comparing it to a couple seasons ago when one girl *kicked* us off our team. She thinks I said no just to be mean and that I'm not being inclusive. When the real reason is I just have social anxiety.

She stormed off during our game and the rest of the team was like ??

She texted the group chat with the team later that she was sorry. I tried to call her but she sent me straight to voice-mail.

I'm honestly over her shitty friendship. She doesn't care about me. She thinks my opinion is below her consideration. If she doesn't get her way then it's like the end of the world.

I want to tell her/remind her about how shitty of a friend she's been but I don't want to hurt her feelings. I'm not going to ghost her though, I think she needs to know how selfish she can be.

Also, we're on a bowling team...

It started as a new thing we were going to do together (he'd move to PC because I just upgraded some of his hardware), and we'd start out from square one. He wanted to check out his PS4 player's stats. Things have become progressively worse since then.

The first few days he complained about griefers and was blown off by his previous crew. Still, I think even the first night he started he put all his off-time into it.

Two days ago I was kindly asked not to play music or podcasts because he had his mic and headset on. I've been going to sleep alone the past few days, and I have trouble falling asleep in silence, so I just tried to play it quietly. A few minutes in he came and turned it off. We live in a studio apartment, so I guess it's fine.

We haven't really been talking. Little texting when we're away from one another.

Yesterday morning, his Saturday, he said he didn't know how this new crew he'd found would react to him being gay, so he asked that I'd be quiet or at least give him warning so he could mute before saying pet names. OK then.

Last night one of them was shouting ""faggot"" loudly enough in my boyfriend's headset that I could hear it. My boyfriend explained that he didn't want to say anything because they still don't know we're gay. We're out to literally everyone we know in the real world, but I guess it's cool to be fake online.

So today I came home. Started talking about my day. Boyfriend was still on the couch, and I literally don't think he moved since we woke up. I got an ""uh-huh"" after he moved his headset back over his ear like you might see in a sitcom.

We haven't done anything together, despite having planned to do things together this week including playing the game together.

I hate to be this kind of person, but here goes. We pay basically the same for our place, but all of the entertainment stuff save the PS4 and his headset were purchased by me while I was working two jobs. My gaming desktop is also plugged into the TV and sound system, and I haven't been able to use any of that stuff for over a week.

I got home around 5:10pm today. Other than the ""uh-huh"" he's asked me if I'd like water. It just feels a lot colder than usual.

I have not wanted to say anything because I felt like I was overreacting, but this is my space and these are my things too. I had also never experienced this guy being such an ass before.

My friend and I recently hung out to catch up on life. She and I go to separate colleges, so she was telling me how her year went. One of the stories was about a toxic friend relationship she has. Here is what I gathered from our conversation. My friend meets a guy (20 year old) from a school club, and they become good friends. The guy develops feelings for her, but she does not like him back. She rejects him, but they remain close. They tried to be in a real couples relationship for a week but it doesnt work out. Within the span of about a year (im not sure if this happened this school year or since last school year. im 80% sure it happened for over a year) or perhaps more, the guy considers her to be his best friend. The dude has issues. He complains to her and is really clingy from what I heard. He probably had a messed up upbringing or something, so he doesn´t really have friends he considers close besides her. After the initial rejection he repeatedly says he has feelings for the girl every so month. The two regularly study in a friend group that they share when midterms and finals come around. 

She says that she wants to be friends still. They are going to be taking the same classes together for next quarter and summer classes. They have the same friend group so she is worried he will leave the group. The guy complains about how he feels like he is replaceable (he is insecure). They are also on the board for the same club together. Her friends tell her their relationship is straight toxic. They argue and complain quite a bit. 


TL;DR  Guy likes girl who does not like him back. They remain friends. Guy still likes girl who still wants to remain friends. Relationship turns toxic. 

I won´t share what I told her to do as to remove as much bias as I can. I will link this post to her so she can listen to other people´s advice. Please.

t2_2jgjljly,1553825658.0,b6rpt5,t3_b6rpt5,2,"I wanna start by saying that I have six siblings. All of which are younger than me except my older sister Fiona (20, F). My brother, whom we'll call Nate, is technically the youngest but ten minutes older than his twin sister Amy, (9, F). Apologies for it being long.

The reason I'm worried about him is because of the many things that have been going on and him not getting much attention. It's difficult to say but let me explain. 

My first/younger brother, we'll call him Andrew (10, m) is the main focus for my dad. For his birthday he gets a PS4 and stuff, Nate gets clothes and stuff and if he complains my father calls him selfish. He always gets put in time out, which I get, he's misbehaves sometimes, but Andrew doesn't get timed out when he misbehaves, just yelled at and that's it. Nate gets put in time out for days on end. Andrew and my dad spend a lot of time together, while they don't go out (My father is greatly ill and bedridden) they have conversations and play games together. Nate gets left out. Andrew and Nate have a normal sibling relationship, they have conversations, play together and argue, but when they do I just feel like my father tends to put more blame on Nate and favor Andrew because he ""holds his name"" and is the first born.

I would say the same goes for Amy, they do spend time together but they are also very different; Amy is more creative and would rather draw and listen to music, while Nate is active and wants to play with toys and our dog. So they do take time to spend with one another, but it's kinda rare.

Secondly is school. My mom luckily got him and my sister accepted into a private school my brother goes too, since she has been trying to get him out of the toxic school he's in. He gets very mistreated by the teachers and has even gotten suspended for defending himself or Amy in fights that the teachers refuse to get involved in. It's becoming too much for him and my sister and I'm happy that they are leaving for the fifth grade. 

Now my question is, how can I more involved in Nate's life? 

I'm a college student, working on getting my communications degree, and am out most of my day. When I come home, which is usually around 6, I walk the dog, do the dishes and am exhausted. However, Fiona works two jobs and my other sisters, Jenna (18, F) hates loud noises (She has autism, loud noises scare her and Nate can get a little hectic) and Katie (16, F) does play with him when she gets the chance but that's when she does. 

I want to be there for my brother, makes sure he knows that I am here if he ever needs anybody, because I just feel like he doesn't have that in his life right now. He's young, eccentric and he's starting to gain some emotional baggage, especially at this age. I guess I'm just scared for him, and don't get me wrong, I am concerned and love all of my siblings, but I feel he has no one to go too and will take the wrong path in life if someone doesn't step up and take his hand. I want to do that, but where do I even start?

We went to the same college and after we graduated, we both started working and living in the same city.    About a year ago, I changed jobs.  My new job was closer to where he lived.  At the same time, he was looking for another person in his apartment.  So I moved in with his roommates.

We continued to have sex when we could be alone but a friend was always close by in a different room at night.

\* 16"" x 2.5"" Engineered Lumber I-Joists, 16"" OC, connected to ledger boards using face mount joist hangers

\* OSB subfloor acting as lateral bracing

\* The clearspan is about 22' across the garage, depth of the loft is about 12'

Full disclosure, never built a deck before but I’ll have some knowledgeable friends helping out. Right now just in the planning / information collection stage and looking to take care of as much of this step as possible.

It’s going to be a freestanding deck, and my goal is to have it be mostly ground-level, however my back door is at just over 3 feet above the ground, so there would need to be steps coming down to the ground-level portion. 

My local code requires that any deck above 2 feet needs concrete piers down to below the frost line, but if the deck is below 2 feet high then deck blocks can be used. I would ideally like to use deck blocks on the lower portion, but the upper portion requires concrete piers.

Is it possible to use deck blocks for the lower portion and concrete piers for the upper portion? I’m worried about some differential movement between the two portions, and the effect that would have on the stairs connecting the two. 

Should I just suck it up and do concrete piers for the entire deck to avoid any possible complications to the deck? 

Also, I want to build a privacy fence on the side of the lower portion, so would that necessitate concrete piers as well because of potential wind loads, etc.?

Recently I've picked up a couple rusty tools and wanted to try out electrolysis instead of my usual vinegar bath and steel wool/file routine.

It all seems pretty simple and reasonably cheap except for the power supply. Most builds I've seen use some kind of car battery charger but it needs to be the manual variety. Something like that just doesn't seem to be available from the stores near me and the options online are too pricey for me expecially since I only really want it for this one task. A lot of the builds suggest picking one up in a car boot sale or something like that which just isn't really a thing near me and obviously not a guarentee.

So looking into it seems all I really need is a AC to DC power supply and there are a number on Amazon for much more reasonable prices (£14ish) like the one below

I notice it is rated for 30 amps and a number of builds I've seen previous are only running at 3-10 amps so is this overkill? Also I notice this power supply seems to have a number of protection features like short circuit protection so I'm wondering if that means it won't be suitable for electrolysis as that's basically what it's doing? Does the lack of amp control pose a problem?

With electrolysis itself I've read that the amount of water or the size of the part will require more current? The main piece I'm looking to de rust is a large record vice so am I in danger of blowing any fuses/melting something with such a large piece?

Also the rebar I've source for the positive anodes are only 8mm in diameter which seems smaller than a lot of the other builds I've seen. Will that be a problem? I was just thinking I'd get less use out of them?

Apologies for all the questiosn and if this has all been answered before I did do a search and read a number of posts/builds on this subreddit but none seemed to answer my specific questions and googling tended to bring back stuff about hair removal instead...
Any help would be great.

I’ve tried to post on here before but haven’t been able to successfully keep a post from getting removed for some reason. Hopefully this goes through!

So I’ve done an entire kitchen remodel (will upload when everything is finished) except for the electrical. The electricians put in new outlets but left the outlet boxes protruding a bit because of a brick wall being behind the drywall (it’s a condo).

I haven’t been able to find a concrete answer on how to tile over the boxes appropriately. Would attaching backer board onto the drywall fix my problem or is are there more efficient ways to go about about this?

Any help or advice is appreciated! Thank you![outlets](https://imgur.com/gallery/TU88RZy)

I tried installing a towel bar kit in my condo washroom.  When I drilled my first hole (to put in drywall anchors), I noticed that it is solid concrete behind the drywall (Drywall is 5/8 inches thick and then concrete separates my unit from the unit next door).

What would you recommend in this case?  I wasn't sure if I needed to drill into the concrete since it's just a towel rack, but I don't want it to be flimsy enough to pull right off later so I'm not sure if just using 5/8 inch long screws are enough.  And do they even sell 5/8 inch long drywall anchors?

How best to deal with those?  
I'm assuming even though the logs are ~90 years old they'll continue to expand and contract a bit, given those aren't settling cracks.  The log beams have been there a long while, but I did disturb them when I installed the [ceiling framing](https://i.imgur.com/naoE4Bc.jpg).

If that’s not the case, then I have nothing to express and wish I did. 

I’m randomly upset for no reasons and I try talking myself out of a bad mood and can’t. It’s sad when he’s happy and I have every reason to be to and just can’t be. It makes me even feel some what abusive because it makes him feel like he makes me uncomfortable or I don’t want to be by him. It always makes me want to cry because at the end of the day I regret how I act, I really just can’t see how to grasp myself and control it. 

I don’t want to fake being happy, I don’t want to fake affection. I know it’s there, I just can’t get myself to unleash it. I’m not convincing myself to love him, it’s just really hard to explain. Like my own emotions are being shackled and I can’t break through. 

He is the sweetest, kindest human and he deserves the world. I feel so bad for pushing him away and it scares me so much too. He’s so patient, but it’s not fair to him and I know it.

I just don’t know how. 

What’s so ironic is I’m always told how amazing my people skills are. And somehow I can’t effectively communicate my love or break my walls down to be raw and vulnerable. I go through (short) phases were I’m happy and can, and I go through phases like this were it seems impossible.

She is an amazing and strong woman, who raised 2 daughters on her own after immigrating to Canada from Korea. I started working when I was 16 and since then I always gave her money to support her because that was the right thing to do. She worked very hard, sometimes 3-4 jobs to make ends meet. I worked 3 jobs throughout my bachelors (nursing) and also always paid her (up to $1000/month). When I started working full time as a registered nurse I gave her $1500/month. I always thought this was the right thing to do. She would never reject the money and would get mad if I came up short. I know she was always terrified of not paying rent and sometimes had night terrors. This was due to my dad never working and earning money and supplying her with any income. She told me that I am filling in the space where my dad shouldve been and thats why giving her money makes sense. It made sense to me at the time and all I wanted to do was help her.

I know she hates being in this situation and has no other choice... Eventually she found a retired man with a good pension that moved in with her. He is financially supporting her now. But I know she doesnt really love him and she had to find someone because of me. She said I can move out now but she will never trust me financially again.

Not long ago I developed eczema and became very busy with a new 9-5 job. When I get home and my  boyfriend comes over he asks to have some fun. I tell him I'm too tired  or my skin is flaring and he sighs heavily and gets mildly upset. I  understand it, if I wanted it and didn't get it I'd be a bit flustered  too. But he doesn't stop there. Every 2-3 hours he'll ask for it again,  every time I say no he gets increasingly upset until he walks out with a  sharp ""Alright, goodbye"" reaction.

Recently  we've talked about it more in-depth and he nearly broke down saying  that he's already afraid of saying no. I felt bad and said I'll try to  do it more often (even if I don't want to), but I'm unsure if I could  successfully please him that way.

I could go on and on about him but this isn't about how I feel about him so I'll just say it was pure luck that we met and it was honest love at first sight for me.

I knew when I met him that I was pretty much setting myself up because I knew from day one that this could never work out since he was leaving at the end of the year.  Nonetheless.... I fell for him HARD. I haven't had eyes for anyone else for months. I've tried to pull myself out of it and let go of him but I can't do it. I don't want anyone else.

I was new at my school this year, so all my friends are from just this year. Out of all of them I've known him the longest and he is the nicest to me. He listens, he's supportive, and he cares. Without him I'm surrounded by no one besides people who act like they wish I weren't there. When I talk to him it never feels like he's thinking about other people he wants to be with or other places he wants to be. So he means a lot to me- he is more than a crush. He is probably my only friend who genuinely cares about me and whatever I say. 

That's why I haven't told him how I feel. I don't want to mess anything up.. and I know it seems juvenile but I really feel that way. But like I said, he's leaving at the end of the year. It's starting to feel real for the first time and I know I'm going to have to tell him at least just to give myself closure. And I know that we could probably keep up talking online but I don't think the chances of that keeping up are too high. And I don't know if he likes me back.

So can someone please give me advice on telling him how I feel? Do I downplay it? Tell him the whole truth that I've been in love since day one? What should I say? How should I say it? I've thought about it so much and I have no idea where to go with it

t2_17eaqp,1553859213.0,b6w5j6,t3_b6w5j6,18,"TL;DR: My boyfriend's wet dreams seem to have stopped being about me, yet he still mentions having them but avoids telling who they are about and it bothers me.

My(24f) boyfriend(23m) and I have been together as a couple for about a year and a half now. 


I will provide a bit of background information about our relationship as I think it is relevant.


I had a crush on him long before he did and did pursue him, but in subtle ways. He was the one to upgrade our friendship to a romantic relationship by kissing me, then asking me out. This was right around the start of our 3rd and final year at university.
We began our relationship passionately and within the first couple of months the intimacy reached sex. This despite my boat load of insecurities about my body image. I lived alone in student halls and he would visit once a week or every other week to hang out and stay over for the weekend. We were in the same class at university so we would still see eachother throughout the week, but since he lived in the next town over and I worked while attending uni, we could only truly have time for ourselves on weekends. Thats when I felt like there were sparks and it was exciting and invigorating. Like I was truly alive. 


We live together now, sharing a house with his mother, as I moved in. That is a separate issue that I will not go into detail, but suffice it to say, due to work and her presence, our sex life has died down and feels less spontaneous and more scheduled/forced now. Not that anyone is forcing the other to have sex, more like ""Oh she's working tonight! Better get it while we can!"" sense. We share a wall with her bedroom and I'm not comfortable with having sex while she is home, which is the vast majority of the time. Moving out is a complicated matter that is impossible at this time.


Anyway, along with the new boring monotony of life, lack of excitement, a personal tragedy that happened to me and my negative views about myself, my insecurities are growing. I have gained a bit of weight but he always reassures me, especially during sex, that he finds me very attractive and hot. (I am planning on working out along with a healthy diet to get back in shape, but I am only just starting) However, near the start of our relationship, when he had a wet dream and mentioned it to me, he would tell me it was about me. 


Lately however, he would mention it, but when I jokingly ask who it was about, he would avoid the question. Not even try and make something up or say he doesn't remember or a random person he didn't recognise. Just straight up avoid it. Blanking me. 


I don't want to seem crazy paranoid or insecure, I have had no reason to ever doubt him before and there are no females in his life that I am worried about. Furthermore I am not and actively try not to be a jealous girlfriend. This just rubbed me the wrong way and I want to know if I'm being unreasonably paranoid. 
I am posting this today because it happened again today. He mentioned having a wet dream yesterday, but when I ""jokingly"" asked who it was about he just dodged and moved on. What baffles me is, if there is something to feel guilty about at all, why even tell me? He said it out of the blue, unprovoked. Also if there is something to be guilty about, even if its just a dream, dreams are supposed to be a sort of window into our subconscious, so what does this mean then? 
Should I do or say anything at all? Should I just let it go? Should I wait until it happens again and if he brings it up, voice my discomfort? 


Sorry for the long post and formatting (on mobile). Any advice will be appreciated. Also please let me know if I am being ridiculous for even letting this bother me in the slightest. ",relationships,"My boyfriend mentions having wet dreams, but they do not involve me.."

We moved down south just after our first daughter was born because I was stationed there. While we were in the south, my wife and I went through a lot of rough times, i would talk to other women online and she would catch me. Near the end of my enlistment I cleaned up my act and started being the husband she deserved. All the while we still had AMAZING sex. I mean we did a lot of stuff that was just mind blowing. We even kicked around the idea of swinging but never acted on it until my enlistment ended and we moved back home.
We have been back home for about a year and a half and in that time I've been a much better husband and father to our 2 kids. We dont see each other much because our work schedules are so different so you would think that what little time we spend together would be either loving each other or trying to blow each others back out right? Well instead it's been kind of the opposite. It's gotten bland and routine. We tried swinging with another couple and we both had fun but now it just seems like my wife is less and less interested in not just sex but me in general and is really only interested in being a mom and playing video games.

We reconnected by fluke last year and started dated. We had both lived very different lives before getting together, but shared the same goals and ideals. The first few months of dating were amazing, but at about the halfway mark the bad news started to happen. At first it was a job letting her go due to government cuts, then her second job cutting her pay in half without warning, finding a new job, and then finding out that their parents had stolen all of their life savings. Her entire life she had been a buggeter and a saver, often putting the needs of others over herself. All things together would seem impossible to happen to a single person, but I had been there every step of the way over these past few months. I've tried to support her in every way I could even putting myself almost in financial risk trying to help keep her afloat, covering expenses for her dog so she wouldn't have to give it up, and even covering fun things, so she could at least enjoy life a little.

Over that time her level of guilt at me helping her rose and rose even though i assured her I was doing it out of love and to not worry. I come from a very supportive family, which i feel now she never had growing up. At the same time her ability to navigate the stresses of life almost became impossible, with the littlest thing setting her off some times into a rage of anger, yelling and hate at the world. Which I had never seen from her before. The only issue is when she gets upset I am always the only one around and in turn bear the brunt of it all. And over the past few months I am burnt out, financially tapped out and emotionally drained. Heck I can't even move in with her like I wanted to in the near future as I've eating through my finances so much the past few months

I understand that there will sometimes be arguments in a relationship, but her frustration at the tiniest thing I say or do wrong in her eyes now often turns to yelling at me, sometimes calling me names and comparing me to people that have hurt her in the past. I used to just sit there and take it, allow her to get it out of her system or try to calm her down, but for the first time in my life I yelled back to make it stop because I guess I snapped. I've never yelled in my life at anyone nor do I ever want to again. I felt disgusted and toxic and hated myself for the rest of the day. I tried to explain that we can never yell at eachother again and she thought it an impossible proposition, that it could happen again, but my response was not if we communicare and promise to try not to ever get back to that point again. She agreed to that, but I fear it will happen again only this time I will walk away as I made a promise to myself to never yell back at someone in anger again.

For an 8th month relationship it's felt like a lifetime has already gone by and I feel like the only reason we are still together is because I haven't given up on us or her. I don't want to give up on us or her as I still know the same person I fell in love with and want to build a future with is in there somewhere behind all the hate and anger at the world. I just don't know how to help them out anymore, nor know if I can put up with it much longer as I feel like a punching bag. At the same time, given all she has gone through in such a short period of time, I feel selfish for even complaining about all this. I feel like maybe if I really want to be with her I should be there and push through it so she can get out the other side even if it means getting yelled at once in a while.

I understand that my boyfriend's very close with his mom. He's an only child, and she's a single parent. His dad lives abroad and they see each other perhaps twice a year.

The way my boyfriend and his mom talk to each other resembles a friendship more than a parent-child relationship. Actually, sometimes they sound like roommates. It was a little weird to get used to in the beginning, but ultimately, it's none of my business.

With that said, is it wrong to disapprove of my boyfriend talking to his mom about our sex life? He's so used to doing this that he doesn't even second-guess why I might be bothered.

His mom doesn't hold back in front of me, either. The last time boyfriend had me over for dinner, his ex came up in a conversation and boyfriend's mom made an explicit comment comparing my penis size to his ex-boyfriend's and proceeded to explain why that matters.

On the one hand, I get that they were making a deprecating joke about the ex. On the other hand, what the hell? I'm sure I'm not the only person who'd find that type of a conversation with SO's parent inappropriate. Not even getting into the fact that she knows our sizes.

I brought this up with my boyfriend the other day. He was surprised that the conversation bothered me, but promised to tone it down. He always does though. I'm afraid he's oblivious to just how weird that stuff is because these incidents keep happening. Before, we had an argument over his mom texting me articles on relationships and sex relevant to our problems.

Am I honestly asking for too much? How can I make my boyfriend draw the line?

Hey all,

I am quite damn confused at the moment, and thinking it may be better to write this all out and get a outside perspective on this.  I've gone to message multiple times saying lets just meet up and pretend it never happened, then thinking she may change her mind, so just wait.

\------

Essentially I met her just under a year ago at a Meetup, and we quickly hit it off as great friends. So much so after hanging out with her a few times just me and her I asked her out after a film, she said would just like to be friends.

We kept hanging out and I did the whole ignore feelings, and they did leave once or twice, but came back in force, especially as it is pretty usual to hang out 3 to 4 times a week together, just us or occasionally with friends.

We even went overseas together on a overseas holiday to two different locations for a combined 5 weeks.

After getting back from the overseas trip, the feelings really came back and I started to build the courage and started to hint that I was interested to test the waters. She however was getting slightly homesick.

She booked flights home for May a couple of weeks back, I was bummed as I found out the day I was going to ask her, so put that on hold.

We went out on Wednesday, had a great time and started talking about I am going to miss her, she bought up at that time that she now likes me, but doesn't want to lose me as a friend. I was ecstatic and said lets just see how things go over the next month and can work out the details. She had mentioned she could come back after a month or so after being home, and I have plenty of leave, and a risk of redundancy at work so have been planning next steps. Had actually spoken to my folks last month about moving to my birth town and where she is from for work (I have a passport there as-well)

As I was leaving her at the train station, we hugged, she then stopped me and kissed me, so yeah, left on a high note, and planned to go out on Friday to see a Comedy Show, Dinner and Dessert at our favourite place.

Thursday after work she messages me, going I made a mistake and don't want to ruin the friendship and best if we just stay friends. I ask if we can speak about it, she calls a couple of hours later and mentions shes not 100% sure what she wants and she needs to be 100% sure, that she isn't sure how it would work, and can we just go back to being best friends (she says this multiple times throughout the call).

I'm pretty hurt, but stay level headed the entire call, I say how much she means to me and tell her the extent of my feelings and was actually working up to asking her out that day, and the day when she mentioned her flights. She wouldn't budge on just going back to being best friends, and sounded very confused about all the variables in her life and not being 100% sure.

I wished her the best for her remaining time here, she said she couldn't enjoy it without me. I apologised, but don't feel at this time I could be friends without hurting myself (although today I have quite a urge to just start hanging out again, miss her tons and don't want to ruin the last month of her being here in a fight, as I really enjoy our time together as-well).

I'm currently thinking of just biting the bullet and enjoying all the things we did have booked together and suck it up hoping I can cope, just because I miss her so much - and if at the end of it all, when she leaves in a month and I still have feelings, just saying hope she comes back.

Just worried about thinking with emotions, and pretty lost, even after typing it all out.

We spoke so much of the time while i was abroad and he would say really profound things like ‘i cant wait to introduce you to my mother’, and ‘i want to spend all my time with you when you’re back’ and so on. 

So i came back and he was good to his word. We spent every second we could together, i met his family, and his mine. We’ve been together for five months now, feels like a little bit of a fairytale. We became official almost as soon as i got home. 

While im looking back, i remember facetimes coming in from another girl and him being honest and saying it was a girl he used to hook up with. The facetimes obviously stopped, i said nothing of it. Obviously didnt love seeing it, but im an adult and neither of us are virgins. But now i know that they hooked up while i was gone and out of the country. 

We werent official until i came back. But it really hurts to know that while we were facetiming and he was saying things like ‘i cant wait to introduce you to my mother’...he hung up and was fucking another girl.

However, there has been one major problem from the very beginning: We don’t have a lot of common interests, the most prominent divergence being our stances on  traveling.

She really loves to travel. In fact I would say that traveling might be the biggest source of fulfillment in her life.

I on the other hand don’t enjoy it at all. I am, and always have been, a restless workoholic with more hobbies and side projects than I can keep up with. One week of leisure is the most I can withstand before I’m starting to get nervous. Sight-seeing leaves me thinking that watching a documentary would have been fine too… and a lot cheaper. On top of that I lead a very environmentally conscious lifestyle and am concerned about what all the unnecessary flying is doing to our planet.

She knows this, though I don’t think she realizes the extent. Last year she flew three times, of which I only joined her once, which is pretty much the biggest compromise I’m willing to make. We’re both about to finish college soon. She already hinted that she wants to utilize the time after her graduation for a more extended journey, which is not really an option for me.

I began seeing my fwb back in April of last year (next Monday will actually be one year since we've met) and he was in a relationship at that time. When we first met I was not looking for any romantic relationship of any kind and he said that I wasn't the kind of person he'd be romantically interested in. His partner at the time had no issues with our arrangement. We actually followed through on the ""friends"" part of the fwb arrangement. We are very close and when I was abroad for a few months, called, vchatted, and sexted around once a fortnight. There were some issues at first - he is the sweetest person I've ever met but can be a bit boneheaded and he said some things that hurt me deeply, but I expressed my feelings to him and we worked it out. I also wanted to make sure that we kept boundaries, and asked that we not use pet names or terms of endearment. He is naturally a very affectionate person and calls me pet names, and I take responsibility for the fact that, after a few months of knowing each other, I stopped enforcing those boundaries.

His partner and him had some difficulties and ended up breaking up at the beginning of the year. Around that time he began seeing two other partners and would do things such as accidentally compare their sexual performances to mine, and also seemed disinterested in spending time with me. Since we were very good friends I was very upset and made the foolish choice of not speaking to him about it because he was going through the middle of a breakup and an important professional training/milestone and I thought I should handle my feelings on my own so that I do not get in the way of an important part of his life. He was obviously infatuated with one of his new partners and did not initiate meetups as often. He did not seem to care about professional or personal milestones in my life and rather used me as a therapist, having me work through the feelings he had for people he thought of more and wanted to spend more time with. I don't think he did this maliciously but there were times when I would ask for him to initiate meetups more and he would apologize, saying that he was busy and that maybe I should initiate less, so that he would feel my absence and come to me more.

He stopped seeing his partners as often around the middle of February. I didn't actually know this as I had asked not to hear about his sex life, as I felt uncomfortable hearing about sex with other people as I didn't know whether his other partners would be ok with him discussing it with me.

Things kind of came to a head when he missed a very important performance I had invited him to. I was absolutely infuriated as this had been something I had been working on for weeks. I knew that he had been more conscientious with his other partners, especially the one he had romantic interest in, and felt used. I spoke to him about how I felt disrespected and that he had little interest in me besides using me as a comfort blanket and a therapist. He was very upset that I had not communicated this back in January. I understand that this is my mistake but to give some context - he was under a high degree of pressure and stress and honestly I felt that having difficult conversations with him at the time would have been bad for him. He explained that I should have at least asked if he would be willing to have difficult conversations with him during that time. I agree now that that would have been the best course of action. In any case, I would have had that conversation with him anyways, but the circumstances of him missing my event made it a situation in which two months of resentment and pain boiled over. It wasn't good.

Around that time I realized I had feelings for him (haha whoops) and decided to tell him because I figured that we should end our arrangement since he so vehemently declared that I could never be an object of romantic interest. I figured it would be healthier for me to stop seeing him and move on.

Well, it turns out he has feelings for me too. I think. That's what he said at least. We both agreed that we shouldn't date right now while we work this out, and he told me that while he would be on dating apps, he wasn't looking for a relationship at the time while he worked on himself. He is very ashamed of his insensitive tendencies, and honestly, I was incredibly upset at him and told him that he was a bad person to me. There were times in January where I would try to communicate my upset, and he would say things such as (paraphrased) ""Oh it's ok, it's not like I don't have time to see all of my partners so I'll keep seeing you"" (implying that if time was a factor, I would be dropped as a fwb).

We are talking about things and we have had difficult conversations in the past couple of days over the pain I felt about feeling rejected and his guilt over causing me pain. He is going on tinder dates, and told me that he might want to start a relationship with one of them. When I asked him where he viewed me as part of his life, he told me that he didn't feel comfortable dating me right now because he still felt guilty over causing me pain. His previous partner also was often hurt by him and he still is very ashamed of how he made her feel. He says that he knows that there are people out there that are less sensitive and that will not be hurt by his words or actions as easily, and that will communicate with him when they are upset (this point really upset me, since the incident at the beginning of the year was the only time I didn't communicate with him when he was behaving hurtfully for what I thought at the time were justified reasons). He says that while he does have feelings for me, he wants to get into other relationships first and see if he is able to think about dating me a few months down the line.

I don't think I can do that. I do have feelings for him and to see him develop a relationship with another person while I am stuck in a limbo of will he/won't he date me will be unhealthy for me. For this reason, I am thinking of ending this year long arrangement. The thought does not excite me at all. I am literally in tears typing this but I don't fucking know what to do.

I would appreciate any feedback this sub has to give. I have made a lot of mistakes the past two months and I want to be told honestly if the disintegration of this relationship is my fault. Thank you for reading.

I’m (20yr fem) and my boyfriend is  (27yr) we have been together for about 3 months already our relationship began a bit too quick.Well here’s the point he still talks to his ex she’s (18yr)they have quite the history together pretty much he impregnated her when she was (17yr) it was while they were at a party both of them were drunk and that happened,he told me he never loved her but he was willing to take responsibility for the baby.Well what ended up happening is that his ex ended up having a miscarriage and he broke  up with her because that was the only thing keeping him with her.That happened a year ago.

Okay so now I come in he’s very open about there history but what bothers me is that his ex comes to him for help when she feels lonely due to her not really a great family support system.My boyfriend has also told me she sometimes sleeps over at his place when she isn’t getting along with her step mother.I spoke to him about how it concerns me that she comes over at his place he told me “it’s because she has no one to support her she has been thought a lot ,she was the mother of my unborn child I can’t just turn my back on her”I didn’t know how to respond to that I felt guilty.

Me personally I feel like I’m being such a possessive person for not wanting him to not be too close to her.Ill be brutally honest what goes though my head I would just suggest to my boyfriend you can talk to her but not bring her to your apartment and that she needs to find someone else to help her with her issues she’s got with her family and herself.

TLDR; Reddit if I’m possessive and selfish please help me with what I can do to improve that.I really don’t know what to do in these situations it’s my first relationship.Thanks reddit

He bought me a gift card to his place a while back and gives me free stuff sometimes and I give him discounts and little dumb stuff too. If he comes in during my lunch he always comes up to talk to me and he pulled up a chair the other day and told me about his grandpa passing away and how he’s quitting smoking. 

We don’t really know eachother that well but I feel like we’ve been friendly and I feel it might seem like more. 

His coworker told me a story about how his brother is helping him move out with his gf. I wasn’t sure if he was talking about his brothers gf or his! I didn’t want to clarify because I didn’t want him to think I was trying to take a guy in a relationship because that’s never going to happen. 

Now obviously I was taken aback. 

I left that conversation confused. The other day he ordered a separate order and I asked who it was for and he hesitated and said his mom then he got another one the other day and when he left I saw him get picked up outside by a woman his age. Soooo. I’m thinking it’s sketchy. 

My gut usually isn’t wrong and I’m not sure what to do because I’ve already caught feelings. Like I said I’m not gunna do anything about it but just stay professional.

We used to chill every day and text when we couldn't, but he just hasn't been replying to my texts recently. He used to say I was one of the few people he could stand to be around all day (his girlfriend and other friend were the other two). All month we casually text and I'm the first person he texts whenever he's anxious (he has anxiety and depression). And whenever he needed me, I was right there and completely available to him.

Last week, my anxiety escalated to the point where my school councillor wanted me to go to the ER and stay there a few days. He asked if I wanted to text anyone. Obvious answer? My friend. And he didn't answer me. Eventually, after about an hour, he texts me back a quick ""yeah"" and I text him another thing and doesn't respond for a while to that either, and when he does, it's just another ""yeah"". Eventually my uncle took me home and he doesn't text me for a few days and he doesn't talk to me at school beyond a quick ""hey"" even when we're alone in the same room. He just pulls out his phone and starts playing video games and I try to spark up a conversation but all he says is the same ""yeah"" and moves on. His girlfriend shows up and he immediately gets up and starts talking to her and gets super into their conversation. And that's just been the whole week.

I try to text him the next time I had a bad day and he didn't respond. So I just kind of moved on, but it's been bothering me ever since.

I eventually did have to go to the hospital. I texted him and another friend. A third friend texted me and I told him what was going on and both of my other friends were just so supportive and ""oh my god, what happened, are you okay, how are you making out, I'm sorry I didn't notice"" and he just didn't even bother to respond.

I've just invested so much emotional energy into this one boy and as soon as I ask for him to just let me vent he turns around and leaves me. It's been bothering me, especially since we just made all these plans on what we're doing in university - ""I'm always going to be bothering you in your dorm, we're gonna set you up with a cute boy, we'll take all our classes together, we've gotta join all these clubs"" Whenever he needed a friend to vent to, I was there. His girlfriend did something shitty? I'm there. He's anxious? I'm there. I don't know why he can't be for me.

I tried talking to him about it and he says he's just been busy but whenever I'm hanging out with his girlfriend, he's texting her 24/7. And I get that I'm not his girlfriend, but it's just rough to see him making all the time in the world for her and none for me, supposedly his best friend. I just need someone to be here for me and it seems like the one person I trusted to be there wasn't. It's one thing to text me saying you're busy. It's another to text me that you're busy but text your girlfriend once every minute.

And now that I tell him ""hey, I've been struggling lately, mind if you make some time for me?""

""yeah"" is his only response.

t2_2q3evmxd,1553842311.0,b6u0ox,t3_b6u0ox,3,"So we’ve been dating for about 2 years and 3 months, but I nearly broke up with her just over 2 months ago. I was really unhappy mainly on account of her sometimes insecure/jealous/possessive behaviours, as well as often feeling like I’m nothing but a medication for her mental illness. Additionally I’ve recently come to realize that I’m bi and that I may want to experiment with that, and that I also felt like I just was not growing very much as a person anymore. So I ended things, but we talked immediately after the breakup, and after a lot of discussion of fixing problems and working towards compromises and stuff, we decided to try things again.

She’s been putting a lot of effort into becoming less insecure, and while parts of it have gotten better, parts are still pretty bad. I’ve been trying to get myself to properly commit to her the way I once did, but the only thing I’ve gotten out of that was just feeling shitty and confused and scattered. I really thought we could have another chance but I’m starting to realize that this is probably doomed. In the past couple months, she’s expressed with me that she’s frustrated and that she doesn’t feel like she can trust me at all, and I’ve expressed with her that I care about her but I still don’t feel ready to commit again the way I did in the past. I feel like I’m getting to the point where I’m realizing that this just... is not going anywhere and I’m just torturing both of us by not ending it. I feel like I am leading her on and I hate myself so badly for it. For both of us this is our first real, serious relationship and I’m just realizing that we both (especially me) have no idea how to do this. I kept saying what I thought would protect her and make her happy without ever thinking about my actual feelings. It’s affecting my mental health so badly and I know it’s hurting her so, so badly as well, but the idea of breaking up with her again is the scariest thing I can possibly imagine... well, actually, it’s the second scariest, losing out only to the prospect of spending my life with her the way it currently is.

But my problem is that we are both very academically driven people, currently students in fairly intense programs at our respective universities, and exams start in a week and a half, and last for about 2 and a half weeks. I know we would both be complete emotional wrecks after something like a breakup. God knows we were both fucking destroyed and traumatized by that first breakup. I don’t want to ruin her life in a way that’ll be on her transcript for the rest of her academic career, and I don’t want to do that to myself either... Am I a coward for thinking I should wait to end things again? How should I approach this?

Additionally how do I make sure I don’t get talked out of a breakup? I tried keeping it ‘clean’ the first time but it just fell apart, and hurting her like that was so hard that I just wanted to do anything I could to take it away... I don’t want that to happen again. How do I make a decision like that and stick to it? Honestly just any tips about breakups would be so helpful right now.

If you think I’m a piece of shit I wouldn’t blame you. I’m stuck and I’m trying to make things right and I don’t know how.

So hey everybody. Not quite sure if any of the original commenters will see, but incase they do, and incase you care even just in the slightest, here's what happened...     


I confronted her. About three times total. It always ended in a big argument with lots of shouting and crying from both sides, eventually trying to make up afterwards. But things got worse over time. We either argued, had sex, or ignored each other because we both felt our mental state slowly going to the dogs. Mine more than hers, in a way, with me being a very sensitive personality.     


I don't really know the words to describe all of this, but I think she just wasn't the person I fell in love with anymore at that point. I still tried, well, pretty much everything, but to no avail, as everything I *did* try just ended up not being good enough or too much.      

I feel like an emotional wreck, honestly don't even want to see her ever again. But I know that's not gonna work since we have a rather similar circle of friends.     


To add up, back in december her christmas gift from me was a 'couple' dance course/class to help her out and spend some time with her. She spent money on that, and I'm honestly very conflicted wether to be egoistic and just leave her to it, or to power through it and go to that damn class every two weeks.      


One thing I want to get out to the world with this post: When you are in a toxic relationship, you will notice. Your body will tell you with a tight chest and hurting heart. I know that ending it was ultimately the right choice, but it still hurts like a fucking bitch. I hope I've learned from my mistakes now.

t2_x8fgk,1553842020.0,b6tzez,t3_b6tzez,5,"So for context, I have never had a girlfriend before her so all this stuff was new to me, I mean everything. Recently we broke up, I broke up with her and to me it was the only thing I could do and i just want you to know if I did anything wrong.

So everything was going ok, I loved her and she loved me and our relationship was great for the most part however things started to change fast. She was coming round more and more weekends and seemed to be taking over my time during the week. Now what I mean is I would feel guilty to go play with the guys instead of her on a work night (I’m out of the house for 12 hours a day due to work) I don’t know if it’s because she was manipulative but I always felt bad if I went to play with them instead but never the other way around.

She had severe mental issues, I mean severe. She left school very early on and has been kind of floating for years now. She has anxiety episodes and is on strong antidepressants, she has been dating shit people in the past and this projected on to our relationship (when I went to hang out with the guys in real life to catch up she thought I was cheating on her, when he had sex she thought I was thinking if someone different etc) and although I loved her it was starting stress me out.

Everything was still going ok until a couple of weekends ago. She and her parents had a fight (she had HUGE problems at home) her dad beats her, because he’s a piece of shit and her sister called the police (apparently) they then basically told her to get out the house. She had a day to pack her things then left for her friend’s. I asked my parents if she could stay and they said that ‘we can’t get involved in their family matters it’s none of our business’ ‘I’m sorry but we just can’t’. I understood this, my parents are old and my mother has anxiety and having her here while all this is happening would stress out my mother.

Her mum wanted her to go home after 1 day (the day she stayed at her friend’s) I said I agree I think you should go home since your mum wants you home to her and she saw it as ‘you’re leaving me on the street to get stabbed’ I said that your mum wants you home and I think you should go home and just try and make things for work for the time being but she wouldn’t listen to me. Instead she pulled this shit about her saying ‘i can’t go back’ and she’s going to live in temporary accommodation or on the street. I said that’s not a long term solution and it won’t work but once again she wouldn’t listen to me, I did everything I could, I gave her advise, listened to her, gave her support but she wouldn’t listen. She then stayed at her sister’s friend’s house for the weekend. All this time she just acted tough towards me and acted like I left her to die. I was stressed out that weekend, more than I have ever been and she saw it as ‘it’s my problem why do you care, you’re not the one who needs to stress, you have no problems, look what I’m going through’

She had to come by on Sunday for her charger and the way she acted was absolutely insane. She came in the door without even telling me when she was arriving, came to get her charger then drink cider at 11am. She made a pot noodle in the house, then slept in my bed for 30 minutes while she contacted her mother. She then said we’re breaking up and that she doesn’t need someone that isn’t there for her and that their parents hate her. I tried to lecture for 40 minutes - 1 hour on my stance and she just wasn’t having it. I was crying since this all hurt me very deeply, I called out to my mother and wanted to explain why they didn’t hate her, she sat there with no emotion through it all. 

Eventually her mother came to pick her up and they went home, she left the silver pendant that said ‘I love you’ that I gave her on the table. My mother then explained to me that she was emotionally breaking me and that I needed to let her go, she’s not a bad girl but she’s been dealt a bad hand a life and she has huge issues. ‘You can’t let her take you down with her’ I agreed, I was more stressed than I’d ever been and I couldn’t handle her.

She then got home and did her usual thing of ‘I’m sorry please don’t break up’ I thought about it for a bit and said ‘no’ I’m put my foot down and broke up with her. She called me an asshole and said I never loved her and that I never cared about her. I just said to myself ‘whatever’ and tried to make things go civil, it didn’t work. So now It’s just under a week later and I’m still reeling. My parents let me know I made the right choice and that she was emotionally abusing me and it’s not her fault she’s just got bad issues that I and her parents can’t solve.

Or should I hold back and let these relationships slip away, just for me to get jealous when they move on because I don’t do what we both really want?

I know things and people change, but I feel like if I never let it become romantic I’d still be very close with that person and all would be well. Now I’m posed in the same situation, different person, and don’t want to make the same mistake. This person has confessed romantic interest in me and I feel the same way, but I said that I wasn’t ready to get involved.

He started assigning me many tasks that were out of my regular duties. And he tells me l I should not do this or that, not in a strict way.

However, there were some complaints that were put by him and my employer does not think it was really him but the next day he requested me to go back there and work. And he has been doing it for the past weeks. I was told he has never asked for anyone else so far.

He agreed and told me to wait at this spot and told him about what I did not finish and he said I should not report him such things, the manager is that for. Of course I know that but I just wanted to talk to him. And at the end, he wished me a wonderful day and handshook my hand.

t2_khekb2h,1553001668.0,b2xc42,t3_b2xc42,12,"Hi, I'm trying to apply [GILA window film](https://www.lowes.com/pd/GILA-Heat-Control-48-in-W-x-15-ft-L-Platinum-Gray-Platinum-Heat-Control-Window-Film/1183687) to a 19.5x12.5"" pane of glass. The glass is loose, so to speak. That is, it's not attached to anything as you might see in videos about ""[how to apply window film](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+apply+window+film)"".

&amp;#x200B;

Well, after a solid 10 tries (nine with acrylic and one with glass) I seem to be no better at applying window film. My first few mistakes were because of dust getting caught under the film. Now I have that taken care of because I clean thoroughly. But also now my problem seems to be the film crinkling as I'm putting it on and, of course, bubbles.

&amp;#x200B;

A huge part of the problem seems to be that the film wants to curl itself back up. During some stages of the process I can put weights on the film to prevent it from curling but when you are removing the backing layer and applying the film to the glass the film curls and sticks to itself and never goes on the glass flat. I always have to lift the film back up to try and straighten it only to eventually end up creating a crease/crinkle where the film has stuck to itself. ...Maybe part of the problem is I'm doing this with the glass parallel to the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

This is crazy labor intensive for me. Each try is like an hour long. So, yes, I've spent at least 10 hours trying and failing at this one ""simple"" task. I've seen four or five videos and a how to article or two but none of them are helping.

&amp;#x200B;

Another problem I have is squeegeeing. For one, I get bubbles instantly and I really have to squeegee  hard and repeatedly to get them out. Sometimes I create creases while squeegeeing out the bubbles.. I think a lot of these squeegee issues would be somewhat mitigated if I could just get the film on flat and straight.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice for a hopeless window film application technician?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**edit -** I'm thinking maybe instead of trying to put the film on the mirror I should try putting the mirror on the film. That way I can keep the sheet flat with weights. Then I'll flip it around and do the squeegeeing. This will involve some tight grips on a thin sheet of glass which I neither want to smudge nor cut myself on. Any advice about how to avoid smudges and cuts while maintaining enough dexterity to manipulate the film and glass? 

&amp;#x200B;

**edit2 -** on second thought, I have some [suction cups](https://www.harborfreight.com/4-1-2-half-inch-diameter-suction-cup-40993.html) lying around that I could probably use to manipulate the glass. ...okay, I feel good about this.

I tried using a chisel to kind of open up the head a little bit, then hammered a screw driver in to make sure it was set deep as possible and used a wrench to help turn it, but the head was stripping after a quarter turn.  I figure the process of beating the slot open with a chisel weakened the screw.

My other idea is to use a multi tool to try to recut the screw head, and I'm going to try that tomorrow, but I worry about the blade jumping around and making everything worse.

Anybody have any other ideas?  Or am I screwed?

Also, anybody know why the fuck?  I mean seriously, who makes it so you can't remove a screw?


UPDATE: Problem solved.  I took an old Craftsman screwdriver, from back when they were made in the good ol' US of A, and hammered it sideways into the slot to open the head, then I used a driver and very slowly spun the screw loose.  For screws where the slots weren't horizontal and I could only get in from one end, I used a Dremel to clean up the other side.  For the one I started last night and stripped, I chiseled away at the wood around the head and use vice grips to twist the screw out.

After some struggle, I've finally found a new electric motor and was able to make the appliance work again:  

- [top view without propeller and top case](https://imgur.com/a/pOo2l8V)  
- [video of reassembly and fan working](https://streamable.com/otdgj)

&amp;nbsp;

However, there was some gimmicks along the way:  

- **Wires, cables and connectors**  
  - The entire [wire + connectors](https://imgur.com/a/njUzRZ4) between the motor and the power source needed to be redone and several parts required use of insulating tape (originally there was none).  
  - The [blue connector](https://imgur.com/a/1UsIIKE) is very close to the radiator fins although not touching.  
    Originally there was no such connector and the [wires were just soldered](https://imgur.com/a/jJNAptp).  
  - The [yellow connector](https://imgur.com/a/QjEG8pv) is using insulating tape while the original used [transparent rubber](https://imgur.com/a/EMlmgCW).  
  - Originally there was no insulating tape over the [thermal protection 'jacket'](https://imgur.com/a/KqqRrfz).  
  - [Power supply cable](https://imgur.com/a/TKEz0t8) touching the radiator fins.

- **Minor differences between the electric motors**  
  - The coil of the new motor is 'exposed' while in the original there is some kind of ['tape protection'](https://imgur.com/a/rxUNnj0).  
  - The new motor has a shaft thicker than the original motor, which required a [new propeller](https://imgur.com/a/LrdxH7d).  
  - The [shaft's bevel](https://imgur.com/a/SXW72td) was extended in order to keep the propeller at the same original height and not touching the top case.  

**Questions**  

Considering I'm not an expert on the topic, I still feel somewhat insecure to turn on the boiler. Things get pretty hot near the radiator and I'm not sure I have protected everything properly:

- What is the purpose of the 'tape protection' over the coil of the original electric motor? Should I reproduce that on the new electric motor?  
- The insulating tape I've applied should be able to withstand the heat?  
- The distiller was properly repaired and reassembled? Is it reasonable to expect that it should last again for several years? Is it safe to use it like that?

Brand new DIY'er here. I want to make a wall with these vertical slats like on the picture. Found some great 1x4x8"" ones in Lowes (pine). But I don't know how to finish them.

They're for indoors, the stain is the only thing im not too concerned about. Ive been reading a lot about finishings and there are so many options it's overwhelming and cant make a decision.  
This description is probably the biggest nightmare for a specialist and would prob make you eye roll, but I'd like it to be 100% smooth, not too glossy.

If you were to make these for your living room, how would you finish them? (will be buying form Lowes or Home Depot).

Thanks so much!!

p.s. do i need to sand the slats? they are super smooth.

They are about 5 years old, and had greyed from the elements. I power washed them, sanded them down, and stained them (oil-based stain, we didn't want to paint them, we wanted the natural wood look). So far, so good! 

The last step, i thought, would be to weatherproof them. I tried putting polyurethane on one of them, and it's turned into a hot mess. I'm finding it impossible to apply cleanly without leaving bubbles and large drips, especially at all the little corners, nooks, and crannies. It ends up looking like my chairs are covered in snots, not the look I quite had in mind. It's a bit disheartening, as they were looking so good, and I feel like I'm ruining my own hard work. 

Some photos! https://imgur.com/a/J7T1VE3

So my questions are this:

1) Is there a better way to weather proof them? What should I be using?

2) Or do I just need to be better at applying the polyurethane? Any tips/tricks to this? I'm using small foam brushes, and trying to not over apply. 

3) If I just left them stained, am I going to have to go through the same thing in another few years? Or will just giving them a good wipe down a few times a year add some life? 

I want to build an outdoor storage bench to match next, so I'm hoping to figure out the right solution for these, and take it to the next project.

Not wanting the baby to get access to the outlet, I decided to just temporarily remove the outlet (until he's older), cap the wires with wire nuts, and cover the box up with a blank plate.

I disconnected the wires from the outlet and had the following:
Two black wires that were spliced
Two white wires that were separate and loose
A red wire that was loose
Two ground wires that were spliced, and a third ground wire that was loose

After individually capping the loose wires with wire nuts and turning the breaker back on, I discovered the other outlets in his room no longer worked. I determined they must be daisy-chained.

So, I flipped the breaker off, and then twisted the two white wires together and capped them. Now the other outlets work.

However, I'm concerned about the red wire and the ground wire.

Do I need to do anything besides cap the red wire? Does it become ""hot"" when the lightswitch is turned on? Is that a concern if that happens?

We wanted to go with lvp for price and ease of cleaning. Full disclosure I did buy the flooring before I pulled up the carpet so that's my bad. Once I got the carpet up I realized that the floor not only has joins but has about a 1/4 inch lift along the edges of the joins. There are a few waves on the flat areas as well though they are (as far as I can tell) within the tolerance for the flooring though it's hard to tell because of the rise of the joins. 

My plan going forward is to sand down the with an angle grinder and then fill the joins. I haven't done that before but I've see that you should use a backer and epoxy so that's what I will probably go with. Any suggestions on that would be appreciated. After that I am going to put down primer and self leveler before going ahead with the flooring. 

The main question I have is if this is a good plan or should I re-think the whole thing. Thanks in advance!

Hi DIY,

&amp;#x200B;

I purchased this West Elm lift-top coffee table (product page [here](https://www.westelm.com/products/industrial-storage-pop-up-coffee-table-large-h3519/)) secondhand at a deep discount, and at the time didn't think it not closing all the way would bother me as much as it has. A night of Googling has only turned up this Quora question/answer: [https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-repair-a-lift-top-coffee-table-hinge-that-closes-with-a-gap](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-repair-a-lift-top-coffee-table-hinge-that-closes-with-a-gap)

&amp;#x200B;

However, both sides don't close fully, so I don't have a ""good"" and ""bad"" side to compare to. Screws all seem tight. Haven't tried lubricating yet, but I'm off to pick up some WD-40(?) after this post. It seems to me (the top closes fully if pressed down, but then springs back up slightly once you take your hands off) like maybe the coil spring is too tight/there's too much tension in the closed position? I included photos of the mechanism fully-extended and half-closed-- it looks like the spring gets stretched as it closes, and maybe it just can't stretch enough to fully close.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any experience or thoughts about this? Is it possible to adjust those coil springs? Am I way off base regarding the probable cause and a little lube will do it? Kind of lost here.

Thanks!

First time posting. So lately my front door has been having problems closing, it doesn't close all the way without me having to lift it a bit. Because of this I can't properly lock my door either. I know for a fact that it's the top hinge that's affecting the door (seams along the side are widest at the top when the door is closed.) I've looked at some of the hinge screws, but I don't think that's whats causing the issue because they all seemed relatively stable. My guess is the hinge might be crooked or unaligned? causing the door to slack a tiny bit. 

Would I have to buy a new hinge altogether? If so, what would be my best approach for replacing it?

I’m currently in graduate school. Last summer, I had an internship that lead to a job offer for after I graduate, starting this fall (standard in my industry). It’s also a fairly social but insular industry- you tend to work long hours and hang out with your coworkers quite a bit.

During my internship, I worked under a guy who was right around my age that I thought was super cute in a nerdy way. I had a crush on him, but I don’t think he had any idea- only one friend there guessed it and she’s super perceptive. I know he at least enjoyed *working* with me, and we spent some time talking outside of work at the social events our company put on that was fun. Sometimes it seemed like he was a little nervous around me (I’m not a stunner, but I’m cute enough, I think, and have made some guys who were into me nervous before), but he also had a sort of neurotic personality. After my internship, he added me and a 2 others from my internship class on LinkedIn. We never exchanged personal contact info, as we had been issued cell phones for work, and that’s how I could reach him if I needed to. Because I was trying to be professional, I also didn’t add anyone who wasn’t a fellow intern on social media or anything.

He was single over the summer, but I was really just trying to secure my job at the time. I had figured that, if anything were to happen between us, it definitely wouldn’t be when I was an intern- but something maybe could once I was working there and likely in a different division than he was.

About 2 weeks ago, I saw on LinkedIn that he had moved to another company earlier this year. I sent him a message on LinkedIn saying that I was sad he wouldn’t be at the company as I enjoyed working with him, but hoped it was a good move for him. He responded and said thanks, and that his office wasn’t too far so he’d come say hi. I kind of forgot to respond after that (whoops- grad school’s been busy).

**Now that he’s not working at the same company as me, should I just ask him out? Is it super weird to do it over LinkedIn since I don’t have any other contact info for him?**

I’ve asked guys out as a woman before- I really have no problem doing that or accepting rejection. He’s cute, but I’m not going to die or obsess over him if he’s not interested.

However, the only way I have to reach him now is through LinkedIn, which feels less than ideal... like I feel like this is a staple creepy dude move, so if I did it, I’d want to be very careful and precise with how I worded it, especially since I don’t even know if he’s still single.

Alternatively, he is still friends with a number people at the company I’ll be joining in the fall, so I may see him around with some of them and could possibly suss it out then... What are your thoughts?",relationships,Should I (late 20s F) ask a former coworker (late 20s M) out over LinkedIn?
t2_3i20ooo6,1553840559.0,b6tt5k,t3_b6tt5k,2," I am pretty sure I am asexual. I've never had a crush on anyone, have never wanted to date and do not want to have sex. There is no childhood trauma etc. I've just never felt romantic attraction for anyone. I love video games, dislike makeup, taking selfies etc and am generally a pretty chill person so I find it easier to make male friends. I am, however, reasonably attractive. I don't put on makeup but I am naturally very skinny (genes) and like to dress sharp. Once I hit high school, my female friends would tease me about guys I get along well with. After a few months of teasing, more often than not, the guy would change the way they treated me or just get weirder. Tbh I thought it was a puberty thing so I shrugged it off. I've lost quite a few male friends to this and I got pretty sensitive about it.

It has not stopped despite the fact that I am now in college. My female friends still tease me about ""good vibes"" even though I am simply happy to make a new friend. Male friendships I've made have transitioned into that strange zone where the guy is ""feeling things out"", asking about past relationships/sexuality etc, but refuses to outright say anything and so I can't reject them and get things over with. The friendship gets strange so I start avoiding them. I do not want a relationship. I just want male friends and I feel like the teasing is stressing me out. I've told a few close friends that I am asexual but they assure me they understand nothing is going to happen but it is all in good fun. I don't know how to convey to them that I don't see how it is funny and that I feel like it is actively ruining my friendships and deterring me from making friends with guys.

t2_2t4qhuoo,1553826913.0,b6rx7j,t3_b6rx7j,10,"So a little background. My siblings and I are Native American. Our specific tribe is rather wealthy and to help out their members, the tribe send out a certain small sum of money every year. Minors do not get the money, since guardians could abuse the checks, so all the money they would get, goes into a different account and builds up a small amount of interest. When the tribe member turns 18, they get all of the money.

My sister blew her amount after 2 months, I blew through mine after a year, my younger brother blew through his in about a month, and now it's the 17 year olds turn and I really don't want him to make the same mistakes as us.

Now I understand he is a teenager, I remember how I felt when I got the money. So many doors are open now. It feels like ""7 Rings"" when you get more money in your hand than most teenagers who work get in a year. He is definitely going to want to spend some of it, and that's fine. It's his money to spene.

However, I just want to make sure I did everything and said everything in my power to let him know theres so much more he can do with it than buy games or food. I've talked with him about CD's and a Savings account with high interest. I just do not feel like he is listening. 

Short reason why. The tribe had a surplus in their budget and gave out decent checks this year. He said he was going to spend half and then save half, but he ended up spending all of it within 2 weeks. This makes me think he is just agreeing with me to get me to stop nagging.

I just want to help my baby brother :( Any advice on how to talk to him to where he may actually listen to what I say? Thank you.

Also, I understand it's his money and not my business what he does with it. Like I said, I just want to make sure he knows his options.

t2_sl9uqyi,1553797072.0,b6ma4i,t3_b6ma4i,4,"My mom makes me sad. It is the things she says, but I’ll start with her life. My mom doesn’t work, and my dad works a lot. She used to work but she hated her job and I think my dad makes enough money where she was able to stop working. 

She doesn’t have a lot of friends. She’s from a different country and her personality can come off as abrasive to Americans, so she hangs out with other Eastern Europeans. She used to have more friends when I was very young and they fell out of touch, but she got back in touch with them a year or so ago so she sees them every month or so. She has some online friends she talks to, too. She calls her sister and mom a lot who live in another country but they all just yell at each other on the phone. 

My dad isn’t very social either, but he does a lot of things on his own and has hobbies that keep him busy. My parents will watch tv together every night and hang out on weekends, but sometimes my dad gets really busy and has to work on the weekend.

I live at home, but will probably be moving out soon. Because I want to feel like an adult and not live in this weird in between stage forever. I feel a lot of pressure to hang out with her and spend time with her, but it’s hard because I work long hours and obviously I want to spend time with my friends too. And when we spend time together she just criticizes me, tells me to eat more/less, wear makeup, wear less makeup, go to the gym, work out less, etc etc. so it’s not very fun for me.

I feel extremely guilty that I don’t like hanging out with her. I try and spend time with my parents and do stuff with them but I also want to grow into my own, because I feel like I’m not progressing with my life living at home. But then I would feel guilty moving out.

My mom will say she’s so sad and stuff and I’ve told her to go to therapy, or start a hobby, or anything and she refuses. She goes to a fancy gym every day and she gets enjoyment from that but she doesn’t have any other hobbies except worrying about me and stuff. I feel bad she doesn’t have a lot of social interaction but she won’t take any of my suggestions.

She also will exaggerate and say things like we’re poor and don’t have money, and that she’s going to die soon so I should listen to her lecture me and stuff like that. I think I am overly sensitive but when she says stuff like that I just feel like crap and want to cry because I’m sad her life isn’t as exciting as it could be. And I feel guilty that we’re poor or something. My mom says stuff like that and then goes to a $200/month gym and gets her hair done at the salon and whatnot, so I know she’s just saying that stuff to make me feel guilty. I do live at home and don’t pay rent but other than that I pay for myself. If it were really an issue I could definitely contribute money so I think she just wants me to feel bad. She knows what to say to make me feel guilty. She will also text me saying that *I* don’t love her or I hate her and things like that, putting words in my mouth per se.

I want her to be happy but I don’t know how to help her. I don’t want her to feel bad but I don’t want to feel super depressed all the time because of this. 

I have gone to therapy myself and talked about my relationship with her but even when I try and take the high road and do what I can she will text me constantly throughout the day how crappy her life is. I wish I could like force her to get a hobby, because obviously I can’t be with her when I’m working.


And I guess this makes me think that being a stay at home parent is depressing.

t2_3hub3j8h,1553758360.0,b6fu8x,t3_b6fu8x,30,"Hi everyone

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - Worried about breaking up with anxious/depressive girlfriend over fear of her mental health deterioirating.

&amp;#x200B;

Throwaway account as per usual, I \[23M\] wanted to ask a question that has been playing on my mind for a while: How do you break up with your girlfriend \[22F\] who is VERY emotional?

&amp;#x200B;

**A little bit of context:** We've been officially dating for a little over a year and vibing for two. She is the absolute best to hang out with, we have so much fun and the banter is always flowing!  We have a lot of interests in common and get along really well on the 'best-friend' side of the relationship, however, when it comes down to the real stuff, I've found she always falls short. She doesn't pick up on my distress regarding a lot of personal issues I have in my life and doesn't know how to sit someone down and actually *TALK* to people about what might be wrong and try to help. Now I'm an 'emotional' person too, I'm very self- and socially-aware but recently I've been feeling incredibly depressed about where my life is going as every millenial does when they're in their early 20s, another contributing factor to my depression is the lack of support or lack of people in my life who are able to provide emotional support. I don't really have many close friends I can talk to (hence the Reddit post...), my best friend is a bit of a fully functional psychopath - he doesn't even know what emotions are let alone trying to understand and put himself in other peoples shoes. I don't have anyone to talk to, only my psychologist which, well, they can't really insert themselves into your lives so that doesn't help either, he just helped me realise that this relationship is a bit toxic and detrimental and one of the main causes of my depression.

&amp;#x200B;

The other day I tried to talk to my girlfriend about how I was doing, I was having a REALLY shit day, so I tried to just have a simple, constructive conversation with her in the hope that it might make me feel better but it actually made things worse. I could see her reaction was annoyance and frustration when I brought up the reasons I was feeling down, and got the sense that she didn't want to talk about the problems I was having and basically told me to 'just get over it and move on'. Not something you really want to hear from the only person you have that can offer you support. - this by the way, is not the first time, I don't bother talking to her about my smaller problems because she just turns it around to try and snap me out of it so that I can focus on giving her love and attention.

&amp;#x200B;

**Regarding the overly emotional stuff:** She has the shortest fuse in the world. She takes meds everyday, and too suffers from heavy anxiety and depression, she will wake up and feel axious about everything and not want to go to college or will be too scared to go out, she'll refuse to make decisions on stupid things like what movie to watch or what type of dinner she'd prefer, she never gives me her opinion - the answer is always ""Whatever, I don't mind"" or "" I'm easy, whatever you want"" and when I ask her opinion on something, the top response I get is ""Meh, I'm indifferent"". You can't have a conversation with someone who is CONSTANTLY on the fence about everything. I've always been there to support her through everything in her life, I'll suck it up because if I get annoyed that she's not giving me any help or idea then the tears start flowing (like, I don't want you to tell me EXACTLY what you want, give me an idea so I know which path to follow!), I've been her rock for our whole relationship but she hasn't been mine, she constantly demands love and attention and CONSTANT REASSURANCE that everything is fine in our relationship, but as soon as I want to talk to her about an issue in our relationship it's like the whole world is coming down. Tears! And I can't talk to someone who's emotions are hightened like that, there's no way to have a constructive conversation about what is actually wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Her mental state is what I'm most worried about. Because she has depression and anxiety, I fear she might in fact hurt herself or it might actually destroy her to the point that she can't get out of it. It's not really fair that I can't live my life to it's fullest potential with no shackles without the feeling of guilt that I seriously hurt someone for my own personal gain but I'm at my wits end. It's not a healthy relationship, I know she's holding me back and I know I'll be able to slowly recover from my depression when I have the freedom to do whatever I want and not have to thinkabout anyone else.

So after a month of talking, 3 weeks of continuous dating and almost a month of being boyfriend and girlfriend there is a thing that has my concern. 

The guy I’m dating is amazing and I’m deeply in love with him, and he is with me. We enjoy each others company so much we see each other 5 to 6 days out of 7 during the week. We have given each other all our time and love, and it’s been amazing. 

The problem however, is this. When we first started to share the bed together he asked me if he was the first to sleep with me that soon. I sorta told him yes, even though there have been others for which the duration before sleeping together was the same. This is something that became clear yesterday evening and then he called me a liar. Which is true, I’m not in denial. 

What my issue with the matter is however, is that I find him not so much involved into understanding me why I would say such a thing. Our relationships has been intense from the start, and there were some instances where I doubt the sincerity of the intensity. An example is when before the third date I told him I was also dating someone else, and then later he told me that the same day I told him, he slept with someone else. It’s not a problem of course, but this sort of act of revenge is what bothers me. Another is for example when we were in the middle of intercourse and he finds that the perfect moment for asking me how many guys have been inside of me. Well wauw. 

Now about yesterday evening. We met up for some coffee and then some dinner, then we went back to his place to enjoy a cozy night together. We started talking, and next to me revealing he wasn’t the only one who I had sex with on a third date, we also had a moment where he asked me to marry him. Now the revealing part wasn’t so much telling him but him founding out by a different story I told him. I know this wasn’t a good thing to do but the reason for my saying so was idk, I had a sense he was super jealous so I just went with it. 

In no way I’m looking for any understanding for my behavior, I know I should’ve been honest with him from the start and understand any concerns he might have if you figure out something like that. With that also comes a strong sense of jealousy and that probably won’t decrease with these kind of findings. Also past relationships might’ve exert their influence on his or mine behavior. Overall I’m just looking for advice on how to make things less intense? We’re in love and I can definitely see this as a long term thing, but just thinking about how on the same night he asked me to marry him and also looked at me with such distrust, makes me super nauseous and concerned.

t2_7odo4rl,1553823166.0,b6rb76,t3_b6rb76,1,"So my siblings and I (F29)have always lived in the same house together, I moved out twice for about a year each time and they havent. I am F(29) and I have two sisters 22 and 26 and a brother 17. We used to fight a lot as kids and teenagers but as adults we pretty much get along. We all have the same habits because we have been living in the same household for so long so we dont really fight as much. 
A part of me feels that because of this living situation we have sort of lost touch and connection in a small sense. When I moved out once and came to visit I felt we connected more, lots of hugs and kisses hello and goodbye and I stood hanging out with them rather than going to my room or my siblings going to theirs but since they dont see me they would stay for an hour or so to hang out. 
I feel we are so busy with our lives and since we live together we dont make time to hang out, except for birthdays etc. The most we do is we watch tv a lot and cook and hang in the kitchen, which I'm happy for so I dont even know why i feel I have to give so much background details.

But the thing is my sister (26) is engaged (about 6 months in) and shes been with him since she was 17 so hes basically my brother (he is here everyday) My problem is that as sisters  I think we should feel more excited. Like going with her to try dresses on and helping pick things and all that stuff people usually do or maybe I just see it in movies and assume real people can express things so easily. I'm happy for her and I wish I could be more active and stop thinking what I should be doing. I keep wanting to make a website for her, but I dont. It's like we say a lot together and agree on things but never do it and we literally sleep right next to each other in the attic (separate rooms). My sister is the type of person who goes all out for people at parties like just today there was a decorations she bought for a baby shower coming up. I get what shes doing, shes doing this so that when she has parties people help. She once threw herself a party and no one helped her with anything. She always brings stuff or makes sweet tables etc for others but thats just how my family is (aunts and cousins) everyone brings a dish or helps out so idk why no one helped her that time (maybe it was bad timing). So her wedding is coming up and I'm wondering if people are going to help. We are a very creative family where we like to DIY and save a buck. 

I always feel awkward when I get close to my family. Idk why, we have always been close, but not close of you get me. We talk about our day and stuff and topics but like when my gramps passed I remember my mom so sad and I hugged her all but I still feel like I couldnt be there 100 and open up , these people are my people why do I feel this way?

I've known my partner K. for 6 years. We met while I was a student and developed something of a sugar baby-daddy relationship. The term makes me cringe, but I guess it's accurate. He'd buy me expensive things and dinners and we traveled together. We weren't sexually or emotionally exclusive back then. I don't want to get all explicit, but let's just say we had our fun.

The idea of being together didn't come up until about 3 years later. K. got a promotion, which also meant moving abroad for awhile. At first, K. asked me to come with him, which I couldn't do because of my studies. We did realize we shared a connection beyond sexual chemistry, though. We decided to pursue a long-distance relationship of sorts. Neither of us expects sexual exclusivity from each other, but we have a strong emotional partnership.

Due to his job abroad, I can only see K. once every few months. We haven't discussed meeting family (our friends know about us, though). In part because of the distance and in part because of the nature of our relationship. We don't have long-term expectations because it seems impractical at the moment, and we don't like being tied down anyway.

The issue is my mom found out about K. through conversations with my sister. She's always asking me whether I have a partner, and now she insists on meeting K. and keeps questioning me about him. K. says he doesn't mind meeting my mom when he's in town, though I feel kind of weird about the whole deal. But perhaps I'm just not used to such things?

Do you think we should go through with this? If so, what should be our approach? I'm not sure how to respond to my mom's questions about the way K. and I met, the length of our relationship, the idea of marriage etc. She's already curious about all of this, by the way.

t2_zv5mj,1553822570.0,b6r7kd,t3_b6r7kd,4,"I am in college. Ive lived on campus (in a big city, totally fine on my own) then in an apartment with an SO for about a year. But after a rough breakup, i’ve moved back in with my mom. I have plans to move out again at the end of the summer.

Until then, my moms anxiety has been severely affecting my social life. She is very terrified of something happening to me, which i completely understand. But i think the absolute lack of taking any risks is making me isolated and lonely.

She won’t let me take uber/lyft alone, can’t take public transit after dark, etc. because she’s worried something bad will happen to me. If i make plans to take a lyft, she’ll just drive me instead. But then i feel guilty for the inconvenience, and like i can’t stay out late because she wants to go to bed. Also, it’s embarrassing to have my mom drop me off and pick me up. 

I had a coffee date from tinder last week and she completely stressed me out beforehand, making me promise i wouldn’t leave the coffee shop. then reminding me off all the homework and chores i should be doing instead of a date (it was like one hour!!!! and the only social interaction i’ve had in weeks!!) by the time I got there I was almost crying and just wanted to cancel the date. 

I’ve had to cancel plans because my mom is too busy and stressed out. She can’t accomplish anything if i’m out with someone new or somewhere in the city at night because she needs to watch my location and make sure i’m staying where i should be and not kidnapped or something.

I’d like to go to someone’s apartment as a third date, we’ve been talking for a few weeks and i feel comfortable with it, but i’m already anticipating that my mom will say it’s too soon and i shouldn’t trust them yet. 

The biggest problem is that SHE CONVINCES ME to be anxious as well. She talks about all the bad things that could happen to me and get me all nervous and freaked out so i don’t even wanna go anymore. 

I’m getting really frustrated, but i really don’t know how to change the situation/boundaries, or if i just have to wait until i have enough money to move out. Does anyone have experience with a situation like this? 

after my date last week she said she can’t turn it off, and that she feels responsible since i live with her she has to make sure nothing happens to me or she won’t be able to live with herself. I respect her a lot and feel bad that she gets so stressed out, but I also am at the end of my rope.

Part of that has been long distance — I did a one year Masters program in California, while he has been living in Massachusetts, where we met. He has a really great job in Mass, and I loved my masters program! It was really competitive and we've made the most of long distance. We visit each other every month, we travel the world together, and I love him a lot! He is nothing but supportive, and I really want to build a future with him. So I found out a couple of weeks ago that I've been accepted to this dream fellowship program in my field at a university near Boston, which is where he lives. I'm so excited to be back in the same city! But I won't have much of a salary, and I want to ask him if he would mind if I moved in with him, but I don't know how to phrase that. He has about 7 months left on his lease, so I want to ask him if he wants that, at least for a few months to try it out. We haven't been dating for that long... and he hasn't brought it up himself.

So we finally hung out at a burger place like two days ago and honestly I talked a lot about myself. He asked and got my last name, birthday, and like idk. He wanted to know about me and I kinda just gave in? He did talk about him but it felt like it was mostly about me. 

Secondly, even though it was our only encounter hanging out he did stand really close, but I didnt mind but then he would brush against me.

We were walking, and when he did brush against me or something he said he wantes to walk on one side of the sidewalk He kept switching. He always walked on the side of the sidewalk closet to the street? Ive never seen anyone constantly switching like that before. It could have been an excuse to brush against me but who knows. I have no idea how common that it.

The entire time it felt sorta off. It was somewhat akward sure, but other times its doesnt feel like idk.. kinda creepy?

Maybe its because I have this feeling he might kinda like me but I feel weird cuz I dont like him like that (if he does). 

The moment that really got me kinda creeped a little was that he sent me a facebook request. He never really said anything about adding eachother, he just said he swore he saw me on his reccomendations list of friends. I was confused on how the heck he would remember that but idk. 

So he basically asked my last name and searched it up on fb, and well I did add him since idk im nice I guess? He immediately texted me after and that was a bit more ehh. 

Im not really sure what to do at this point. I feel weirdness from him, but it feels weird to be all ""oh hey I get these odd vibes from you, I dont wanna hang out k bye"" after we hung out two days ago and this fb thing.

t2_16jsil,1553822152.0,b6r4xt,t3_b6r4xt,4,"A few months ago, my wife stared a new job. To give some background, my wife works in a broad field, but in a very specific, niche part of that field (think of a lawyer that practices a very specific kind of law).

She worked in her previous job for 5 years, and while she enjoyed the work and the flexibility her job had (she could work from home anytime she wanted), but those were pretty much the only good things about her job. The management there was terrible, her other co-workers were cliquish, the benefits were bad, there was lots of instability, and my wife generally felt unsupported in her role. There were many days that she would come home and practically be in tears because of how frustrated she was with the job. She had passively looked at different jobs a few times, but kept going back because she enjoyed the work and the flexibility, despite things getting worse. 

The final straw came a few months ago, when her old job announced that all staff members would have to take a 6% pay cut. At that point, she kicked her job search into full gear, and quickly found a job with the county government. While the job is in her field, it doesn’t have quite the same duties as her old role, as she’s not interacting with clients, and is doing more “office work.” However, it came with a healthy pay raise, is only 10 minutes away from home, and with all the benefits and job security that a government job offers.

However, she’s been at her new job for two months, and she doesn’t like it. Since it’s doing less interacting with clients than she’s used to, she feels very bored and that she’s not challenged and making a difference like in her old job. Much like at the old job, she comes home practically in tears because she’s so unhappy.

I totally sympathize with having a job that you don’t like and aren’t being challenged at; I’ve been there before and it totally sucks. However, I personally feel that she’s got to give it more of a chance, as she’s only been there for two months. Going back to her old job isn’t a realistic option, and probably not one to go down given her unhappiness there. In terms of other jobs in her field, they don’t really exist unless she wanted to take a larger pay cut than we could realistically swing, which isn’t ideal as we’re hoping to start trying to get pregnant later this year. 

I guess my trouble is figuring how to be supportive. On one hand, I hate to see her so unhappy in her job. On the other hand, I also feel like she’s being a bit unrealistic about her expectations, and I sometimes want to tell her “hey, if there aren’t any other realistic options to work in your speciality area, this doesn’t seem so bad, so maybe you should suck it up and deal with it?” Or is there some kind of middle ground in how to help her be supportive?

After this had been decided and we were walking our future suitemate [18F] through filling out online housing forms, what meal plan would be best for her, etc., the former friend stormed into my suite and started yelling about how the roommate situation would be bad and he's not okay with it.

Additionally, the former friend isn't going to be in my suite next year, and we are not allowed to discuss personal matters, so it really isn't his business who I live with.

I got out of a very toxic 4 year on/off relationship Jan 2018 where she cheated on me with a friend and I stayed, but began revenge cheating on her. I lost all feelings for her in this process and she eventually left. I know I should've just left in the first place instead of being petty, but this is how I handled it. And it is the mindset I still had when I met my current gf over summer 2018. We'll call her Ana. 

I was not interested in any serious at the time, and I made it clear to Ana. She agreed she wanted nothing serious. But, very early on, I realized that I could easily see myself marrying this girl. We still weren't dating, and I was still sleeping with other people, which she knew about and was free to do as well (not sure if she did, I never asked). I knew that I wanted to be with Ana eventually, but I still wasn't ready for anything serious and wasn't ready to be exclusive with anyone yet. Ana started also wanting more sometime in late fall. I asked Ana if she could wait until next summer (2019) to have a relationship. I needed time to get my shit together and stop flirting/hookibg up with other females. 

There was another girl I met around February last year, before I met Ana. Let's call her Jill. I had no romantic feelings for Jill, but she quickly became very much in love with me. I was clear we would never date, but that we could remain FWB. She was okay with the arrangement. When Jill found out about Ana in December (that I had taken her to meet my dad) she freaked out. She knew that I was moving towards being with Ana long term. Jill threatened to kill herself if I left, wished that Ana would die, told me she had nothing without me, etc. I did have friendship feelings for Jill but I did not want to date her, but I felt bad. 

Early January Ana asked me to be her boyfriend. It was unexpected for me, as I thought she agreed to wait till summer. I still had the Jill situation and was still sometimes speaking with other women. However, she made it clear that if I couldn't commit to her then that she wouldn't wait until summer. I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID NO. But I said yes, because I didn't want to lose her. 

So we're dating now, and I begin cheating. Jill still is around, constantly begging to see me and buy hotels for us on the weekends, telling me that she feels like dying when she thinks about me dropping her for Ana. I know it's wrong. But from January until early this month I see Jill probably 5 or 6 weekends and cheat. It's not that I had feelings for Jill. It was just what I was used to doing, and I also felt bad about hurting Jill. Once I cheated a few times with Jill, flirting with other women didn't seem so bad. I got head a few times from other women. Ana had no clue, and honestly, she was still treating me perfect and I really do love her. I don't know why I did any of this. My retelling sounds emotionless but I truly am extremely remorseful and I feel so awful for doing this to Ana. 

One of Jill's friends told Ana last week. It was the worst day of my life. I know it was worse for her. It was a huge fall out where I came clean about the rest of it. In the end I blocked Jill out of my life and everywhere, I gave up all my passwords to Ana, and Ana still hasn't decided if she wants to give me another chance. I was so stupid about everything, but I REALLY want to change and give Ana what she deserves. I wasn't ready to fully commit and I should've held firm to not dating until I changed, but this whole situation shocked me into realizing that I was being an awful human and how much I DON'T want to lose Ana. Like I said, I feel as if she's ""the one"" and I'll likely lose her because of my actions. 

It's hard to explain all of this over text with appropriate feelings behind it and I probably seem like total trash. I am. But I want to be better and I want to mend things with this amazing woman. I don't want to cheat anymore but I'm afraid I'll fall back into old habits if I don't get some advice. I don't know why I didn't think about how much it would hurt Ana vs how hurt Jill was from the beginning, and I don't know why I wasn't scared Ana would leave from the start. I don't know. I just know I fucked up and I want to change. 


What steps can I take to help Ana begin to rebuild trust?

That didn’t quite feel right either, but I recently found a home in identifying with both sexes, as being bigender. It’s the only label that’s ever fit. After realizing that, I started identifying as fully gay, which also felt like a much better fit. This is where things get confusing.

I never felt that I experienced heterosexual attraction, through talking with other (gay) women and some with men about how they experience love with another woman, I felt that I experienced love and affection with women in a way much more similar to how they did than cis men did with women, which further solidified myself as being gay. It works something like this: as someone who identifies as bigender, all love I experience is gay. My “womanly” half (an extreme oversimplification, but bear with me) is attracted to women and my “manly” half is attracted to men.

I’ve only ever dated women, but it’s always been rocky. My first relationship with a woman was deeply abusive. After that I carried on dating two women at once for almost 2 years, and was off and on emotionally with a 3rd (female) partner for a few months throughout that as well. Yeah, I know. It was messy. Flash forward a couple of years and every relationship I’ve had with a woman has been pretty tragic. Broken hearts abound. I hate it. I promised myself I’d never hurt anyone that way ever again. 

Just before my most recent partner moved in, I decided I was going to give being fully gay (mlm) a go. I was feeling good about it but when my roommate, then a platonic friend, moved in, (we’ll call her Sarah), things changed. I think she’d had a crush on me for a while and insisted on sleeping with me in my bed bc we didn’t have a mattress for her yet as she moved in under emergency circumstances. Well, as things tend to go, we began to get involved physically.

She’s very aggressive sexually and it bothers me. I began to question if I’ve ever really enjoyed having sex with a woman and what exactly my deal is because I found myself pretty thoroughly unenthused at the prospect of having sex with her. I do get aroused by her touch and enjoy oral sex and touching but anything beyond that, frankly, grosses me out a bit. As a contextualizer, I wasn’t particularly attracted to her to begin with, but as we became more emotionally involved physical attraction somewhat developed. 

I was kind of just pushing through, but last week, something particularly concerning happened. She was going down on me (despite me pushing her away a few times) and I almost completely dissociated while it was happening. I stayed hard and even finished (one of the few times I have since we’ve been involved), but I don’t think it’s normal to abandon the moment mentally in order to “get through” receiving oral sex. 

Now I’m questioning it all. I enjoy women and women’s bodies. But feel grossed out at times by the idea of having sex with them or being intimate with a romantic partner of the “opposite” sex (I almost never have issues during casual hookups). 

What do I do? I don’t want to hurt her feelings, but I’m really feeling like women aren’t right for me. There’s just been so much difficulty for me romantically and sexually when dating women that I’m considering swearing them off forever...again. What do I do? I don’t want to hurt another person.

Tl;dr: I think I’m gay, but I enjoy women (for the most part), what could this mean?

t2_1r3ut6xq,1553810222.0,b6oxmb,t3_b6oxmb,8,"
Let me start this by saying that it (was) my first serious relationship but not my first love. I had my heart broken 3 times before that because of unjustified break ups and being cheated on. Dont know if its relevant to the story but there you go. I say that because i know how it feels to be broken up with when you think everythings going great. Not a great feeling at all and i think i just did the same to her with this situation. 

A bit about my personality :
I'm kinda reserved in general, i dont like going out to bars/clubs or parties. I just dont like loud ambiance and being constantly surrounded by people i dont know. Point is, i like hanging our with small groups of friend or just one person at a time. I have few interests in life but those i have, i'm very pationate about. I would think as being somewhat funny, im kinda eorried about saying that i'm smart because generally people who think they are turn out to be the opposite but i do know i'm a very logic person. But above anything else, i'm a very caring person. It might also be my buggest flaw since its what lead to my relationship going down the drain. I will always make the need of other go before my own and this is ever since i was young. I cant stand seeing people around me not happy or un need and so i will make everything in my power to make them happy even if it makes me unhappy. Such was the with my gf (ex gf).

A little bit about her:
She, like me, is a very shy person and likes to stay indoors or do things with a small groul of people or just 1 person. We have alot of interest in common and she's pationate about her interest as much as i am to mine. She's funny, loving and most of all very loyal to our relationship. Thing is, she has a very big anxiety problem coupled with trust issues and self esteem issues. Not the greatest mix but could be worst. She's very happy when we are together but very unhappy and stressed out when we arent. (We live 2 hours appart so we see each other maybe once or twice a month for 3 days straight ). She has alot of trouble with controlling her emotions and is sometime very mean and impulsive with the way she talks to me and about us. But says thats i mean the world to her and i'm the best things thats ever happened to her.

So, that being said, i got fed up with it and decided to leave her.

The relationship was always 100 or 0. It always went perfectly or it was the worst. More often than not it was going great but for the times that it wasnt, it was unbearable. Every fight was the same. I would somehow make her upset ( sometimes for the smallest reasons like playing video games together and she would be displeased ) and then it would be a non-stop argument where she would be mad for the most insignificant reason and would blame for being miserable in life and how i never understood how she feels or what she is going through then she would make me feel bad because my life is a little more cozy than hers. It could go on, and on, and on for 4 - 5 hours straight while i'm juste trying to understand how me losing in overwatch caused all of this.  So in essence, the smallest thing could set her off and she would start emptying her feelings on me like a punching bag ( she never got violent with me but i know she hurts herself but son in any serious way.)

I have endured this for 2 1/2 years but now i'm fed up and for the first time i didnt end this fight by saying i was sorry and writting her a 5 page essay to tell her how much a love her to bits, but instead chose that i didnt desrve to being told to go fuck myself and eat shit so i told her that i was done and then i blocked her everywhere except my cell where she proceeded ( idk if thats a word ) to call me 189 times and send me 230 text messages varying from "" no please i love you why are you doing this to ME"" to "" im gonna kill myself if you leave me"".  I know she wont do it, at least i hope so, but being me i cant live with myself knowing that i caused her pain by leaving her. Pretty sure it sounds silly but thinking about it makes me feel guilty to a point where i wonder if i should stay with her to make her feel better and hope it dosent happen again. 

I know it will most likely happen again but she juste started taking meds for her anxiety and i feel leaving her before seeing any results, like i'm making a huge mistake by leaving her now that she's finally making an effort to better herself despite me telling her for 2 years that maybe she should go see someone about it. I'm juste sad because its too late now seeing as i dont think i love her anymore. 

Am i in the right or am i selfish by doind what i did ? I want your honest opinion as to what you would've done in my place.

However, recently when we hang out I've started to get annoyed with him for no real reason. Over really little things, like him being slightly more critical of a movie than I am, or him disliking something I like, just blowing small things out of proportion.

I think it's mostly my anxiety making things worse. It's caused me to be snippy and rude to him and frankly he's getting pretty tired of it. Now it's gotten to the point where I wonder if we should break up just so I can spare him the struggle of having to deal with me. It's like this intrusive thought that's burrowing into my brain and I can't get rid of it (yes I am currently in therapy to work on this but progress is slow).

I'd have the 2x10 beam across the post sit in notches cut out of the posts, and then bolted to it.  The joists would attach to the ledger and beams using joist hangers.  I'd have a slight slope on the roof letting rain/snow drain away from the house.  I was thinking 1:12 (dropping one foot).

&amp;#x200B;

We've known each other for about 3 years but have gotten a lot closer in the past year. I'll refer to them as S. Since I moved only a couple blocks away from their apartment in January we've been spending more time together, and have been fighting more frequently as a result. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the past when S has called me out on iffy behavior, I've always taken a look at myself and sought to change whatever negative or problematic pattern was in question. For example, they mentioned that it was weird/gross when I was making comments about my current partner (21/F)- that I loved her lips. I was making objectifying comments, and I can definitely appreciate why S would be uncomfortable with it, especially as a female. Although I didn't like to hear it, there was something to reflect upon. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing to mention is that we are both non-binary.  Probably our greatest bonding point is discussing gender roles and how we can change our views to better accommodate a less-gendered future. We'd like to think that gender roles are a huge cause of relationship struggles... which is a bit ironic considering our current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past summer, S began doing sex work as a sugar baby. Where we live, a lot of broke college students consider doing this type of work, the vast majority of them female. I believe people should be free to make their own decisions about what to do with their bodies, and therefore have never morally objected sex work. I have, however, been greatly concerned about how S has allowed their sugar daddy to treat them. I've seen them covering bruises from their sessions. BDSM type stuff. Again, not my place to say its wrong, but still upsetting to see. I cautiously support this decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this past weekend. I was talking about my parter, saying to S how I found her appreciation of fashion and wine to be attractive. S then says ""Wow, she would make a really good sugar baby"" and kinda laughs it off casually. I told S that I thought it was an off color comment and that I didn't think it was an appropriate thing to say about someone else. They were really confused that I was upset. Unfortunately they had to leave to finish up a paper so I left feeling uncomfortable with the exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

S texts me about an hour later saying how disappointed they were that I misunderstand sex work so much. That to S, sex work is no different of a career choice than one's decision to become an accountant or lawyer. In the past when we've had conflict, S has always tried to start arguments over text, and in the past, I've insisted we talk in person. This time though, I engaged over text. I wish I hadn't, but I was really upset! Anyways, I basically said that I'm totally fine with one's decision to pursue sex work but am uncomfortable with S suggesting sex work to someone else without knowing how they feel about it. To me, making that kind of observation is creepy and objectifying! In S's mind though, it would be no different than suggesting that someone be a car sales-person, and they're so confused and disappointed that I see a difference. To which I say, the difference is that a car sales-person doesn't have to have sex or be hit to complete the job (I think it's important to note here that I am aware that sugar babies don't necessarily always have sex with their sugar daddies). Now S is offended that I'm bringing up being hit and that I've crossed a boundary. The argument has now morphed into being about S's foray into sex work. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I need advice. We are probably gonna meet up sometime over the weekend to talk about it all and I'm really conflicted about what my position even is. On the one hand, I wouldn't ever tell someone what to do with their body. On the other hand, it really concerns me to see my friend take this path. For me, doing sex work would cause a lot of emotional damage and regret. I feel obliged to voice this concern. I love S and don't want them to make foolish decisions.  I can't help but notice- when S has criticized me in the past, I've appreciated it and tried to fix the issue. Now that I'm making a criticism, S is ""disappointed"" in me? It doesn't seem fair. Also, my original concern wasn't even necessarily about S doing sex work, rather it was about the comment they made about my partner. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course all advice is welcome, but if there are any readers out there who have been a sugar baby or have been involved in other types of sex work, please let me know your thoughts. I understand reddit probably isn't the best demographic for such a taboo subject like sex work, but I figured I'd give it a go anyways.

t2_jus06,1553829818.0,b6sdgm,t3_b6sdgm,1,"So basically after my friends (Shelly and Liza) and I graduated college we went to Europe together for 2 weeks. 1 of those weeks all three of us were together and then Shelly left for home and Liza and I spent a week in another place. When we got back to the states Liza stayed in her hometown, Shelly moved states away for grad school and I moved home (about 45min away from Liza). Liza and I were arguing off and on for a couple months because when I was in her city she wouldn’t make time to see me. She would choose to hangout with her other friends over me and said that I wasn’t allowed to hangout with her and her friends because, “she doesn’t mix friend groups.” Whatever. So we get in a big/final argument and decide not to talk for a bit. 2 months later and we haven’t texted or snapped directly at all. I have decided I’m better off not being friends with her but here lies the issue. We have a group snap for our friend group, 7 people males and females. We all live in different states (besides Liza and I) so it’s not like we can hangout. There is a lot of trauma that comes from mine and Lizas friendship and it’s really hard to move on from her when I see snaps in our group snapchat every single day. I have no clue what to do. 

I don’t want to leave the chat because then I won’t see what all our other friends are talking about or going back and forth on.

I actually liked it, in all its unedited glory.

That night I was talking with my long distance boyfriend [19M] of seven months, brought up the picture and how I liked it since he knows I’ve been struggling with myself lately.  I essentially outright asked if he wanted to see it, which his answer was “sure,” something that kinda hit as unenthusiastic (but he does also say sure instead of yes in instances of 100% yes). His response was “oooo 😍” and then that was that, nothing else pertaining to it. I just feel underwhelmed by it, especially since that was the first of any “sexy” pictures exchanged and it didn’t set a good precedent. And it’s not like this is the first time he’s seeing my body, from that angle, maybe, but we’ve been intimate before so he’s seen much more.

So basically my oldest friend had been getting texts from my ex girlfriend a few months ago. He was telling me there were a bit provocative, he never really asked my permission to do anything but I got the feeling he was trying to ask my permission so when I caught on I told him I would appreciate if he didn't do anything, I don't have any feelings for this girl anymore, we stopped seeing each other 4 years ago and I have been in a very happy relationship with my currently girlfriend for 3 years, we are even moving in together in a few months. He told me he based on my reaction that I was clearly very uncomfortable and assured me nothing would happen. I figured that was the end of that.

Well we were at a bar with some friends the other evening and he let it slip that she ended up performing oral sex on him. Clearly I was very upset because not only did he lie to me for a number of months, but he was in a relationship with another girl (and still is) when this event occurred. When I called him out on cheating he said that it was a ""gray area"" in their relationship. I am certain if you ask his current girlfriend she would disagree, while they were were a new couple I doubt that she would have been okay with this.

I told him that I didn't approve of his behavior and that I was very upset that he had lied to me, he then apologized and we went on with the evening. I was still pretty upset but I tried to play it off for the sake of the evening so it wasn't awkward for everyone there. I have known him through elementary school, high school and we even go to the same University. I am so shocked that he could have such little respect for me to go behind my back like this. I don't really know what else to do. Do I stop talking to him? Should I contact my ex and tell her to back off? Do I forgive him and move on?

At the same time, this friend has changed a lot in the past few years. He moved out from his parents 2 years ago and started smoking 2 joints everyday, and does cocaine bi weekly. He has becoming super unhealthy, often showing up to work stoned or hungover (sometimes calling in sick) and partying ever other night.

I come from two long running relationships, which definitely took their toll on me, and for a while I didn't want to be with another girl and rather focus on my career and passions.

I managed to get a nice job as full stack software developer (my passion is informatics and technology) in a firm 3 minutes from where I live, basically my dream job.

After some time, I met this girl at a dinner with friends, and we started dating shortly after that evening. We have now been dating for more or less one year and a half, with many bumps down the road. Long story short, after a fiery start, things got a little colder and I started noticing some things that I didn't like.

1. We have common interests and agree on almost nothing. I like many things, have a lot of hobbies, watch every movie genre. And yet I cannot watch even one movie with her because she only likes titanic and a few other movies. She can't finish even one episode of a tv series before getting bored and watching IG on her phone. Basically, we have no couch-time together, which I really dig… you know, the good ol' Netflix and chill.
2. She has joyful/enthusiasm spikes and, shortly after, sad/depression spikes. Constantly. I am quite easy going, and have a hard time dealing with these 180° most of the time.
3. Sex has been far from great, she’s shy and doesn’t really get into action.

But nonetheless, I decided to put up with these issues and differences and try to deal with them since not all the people can share common interest but get together well eventually.

5 months ago, she moved from the city where I live to a bigger city \~70 miles away, due to a new job, and we get to see each other in the weekends.

Now, I bit of backstory: I worked in that city before landing my dream job and those were some of the darkest time of my life. As a result, I absolutely loathe that city, while - obviously, see point 1 - she loves it, because is the city of fashion and shining lights and cars, while I live in a &gt;100K people city with not much fun and nightlife. Being the simple-life-lover that I am, I bought my first house in my little city planning to live here.

The real problems begin in the moment where she wants ME to have a better job (which, I assure you, is not a bad job) and move to her city, or a city in between the two. I have been working for 8 years, while she is at her first working experience. I have an open-ended contract with many career possibility, she is currently an intern.

I don't want to lose my solid job position, and I don't want to leave my city, but now It has come to the point where we fight over the phone because I don't want to go in her city in the weekend and I should get a better payed job in her city (which in turn would cost me a lot in terms of rent and/or commuting). Meanwhile, I can't say anything about her job or her returning to our city, or she gets mad at me. 

I feel we have come to the point where It's either me or her, and I'm thinking of breaking up.

Every time I think of breaking up with her I feel relieved, but at the same time afraid of not getting to know new girls since at this age it becomes more and more difficult to meet new people, and I deeply fear a life of loneliness or getting too old to have kids or start a family.

I am really at a fork in the road, and I need some advice on which direction to take. Open to any kind of advice.

So my boyfriend and I just started dating like a little over 6 months ago. At first I was just elated that he was seemingly as interested in me as I was into him. Just within the last month or so I have felt like I’ve been pushed to the wayside for all the other things in his life.

I’ve always had a hard time with intra-personal relationships and have been diagnosed with depression and moderate anxiety, I’m going to therapy for it and am working through things. (The only reason I’m including this is bc I have had problems with past connections because I have over analyzed them.)

I’m genuinely concerned that my boyfriend just isn’t interested in me anymore. He won’t communicate with me all day, even after having read my messages and going on social media.  He almost never initiates “hanging out” anymore unless if he’s hanging out with his friends. He’s completely stopped referring to us going on dates and whenever we do stuff together it’s almost never just us anymore. Honestly the best part about our relationship is physical and even still sometimes I can’t help but to think it’s forced.

I try so hard to go out of my way, leave my time available so that if on the off chance that he can do something I’ll be ready. Then he almost never initiates us doing anything until it’s last minute.

I’ve addressed it before, but didn’t know how to express what I wanted to say. Like I know that he’s putting into the relationship, it just feels like it’s JUST enough,  if that makes sense. On top of all of that he’s having issues with school and money and he just had two different cars that have broken down within a year of each other, so I get that he has more important things to deal with than our relationship. But he always has time to go snowboarding and plenty of time to hang out with his friends and go to bars and play ultimate frisbee (his favorite sport ever).

I just can’t tell if I’m overreacting or if I’m over analyzing things. I have genuine feelings for him and he says he does too, but I’m just so tired of feeling like I’m carrying this entire relationship while I’m trying to work out my own problems.

t2_3hsk3rbh,1553737314.0,b6cuje,t3_b6cuje,26,"My (23F) friend, Jake (23M) has been seeing this girl, Anne (22F) for a few months now. They moved in together after only a couple weeks of dating, and 3 months of know each other. It was strange and everyone scratched their heads at it. 

These are the signs to me the relationship is extremely unhealthy and borderline emotionally abusive. I might be sensitive to any signs of this because I’ve been abused and am not sure if I’m being fair, so I’d like people’s opinions. 

Anne doesn’t let Jake attend any social event without her. It doesn’t have to be partying - if our group is meeting for lunch and she can’t make it, even if he is free, Anne doesn’t want him to go. 

Jake can’t be alone with any other girls, under any circumstances. She is extremely paranoid about any girl that’s around him, including me, even though there is zero history or interest between us. 

She also got upset at past photos on his social media with other girls (even non-girlfriends/hookups) and made him delete the photos, saying to keep them up would be “disrespectful” to her - some of them were years old. 

Anne regularly looks through his phone to check up that he’s not hiding anything. When he doesn’t text her for more than maybe 10-20 min when they’re not together she starts freaking out. Demands to see his location from snapchat at all times. (He has never cheated on her or been close, to my knowledge he’s a very faithful bf). 

Anne publicly berates him. She criticizes his appearance a lot, saying he shouldn’t order the fries instead of salad since he’s “getting fat,” constant comments along that nature. 

Jake does everything for her. We’re all in the same uni, he arguably has a heavier workload than her, yet she gets him to write her essays/other work.

Anne has now isolated from his friends entirely. While fighting one day, he told Anne that our group doesn’t like her (we’ve made a couple comments). They made up, and now he isn’t “allowed” to see us anymore and had to block us on social media. 

According to her, we’re trying to tear them apart and want to ruin their happiness. Only thing is, I’ve never seen him less happy. He always seems extremely stressed out and like a shell of himself. 

There’ve also been a couple occasions where she’s thrown things at him, like shoes.

The guys in our group just act like it’s nothing and girlfriends can be like this - I feel if the gender was reversed and our friend was the girl in this relationship, they’d be concerned.

Should I get involved in this and try reaching out, or just leave it be? 

Tl;dr my friend’s girlfriend is extremely controlling and takes it to extreme lengths, treats him poorly and isolates him from his friends. The rest of the group isn’t that concerned, I believe if he were a woman they would be. Should I say/ do anything, or just leave it be?

t2_3ajvil6f,1553814422.0,b6pr8t,t3_b6pr8t,8,"Hi so recently I’ve been unsure on how to react to a few things going on in my relationship with my girlfriend. We met on tinder and have been going out for nearly 2 years. Everything’s great for the most part. We love each other, have a good sex life, spend time with our friends and family together. We click. 

However recently I have 2 things that have come up.
We were supposed to grab lunch tomorrow at a good restaurant near her work and she ended up cancelling on me saying she wanted to get more work done that day. No problem. Except I just found out (through shear chance) that she ended up going to that restaurant for lunch today instead. I think she just went with work friends but I don’t understand why she wouldn’t tell me. I asked her after what she had for lunch and she lied. I don’t know why she would have to lie but she did. Its not a big deal, maybe she didn’t want to make me feel bad? I’m a little confused by her actions, and wondering if its worth mentioning.

Secondly, early in our relationship she was always concerned about me liking other girls pictures on instagram when I swore to her they were just friends, I also followed an exgirlfriend or 2 and she called me out on it. I admitted i was wrong and i unfollowed my exes and stopped liking a lot of other girls pictures. 

Fast forward a month later, I find out shes following majority of her exes and a lot of dudes she dated in the past, After looking into it even more, I noticed she was liking a lot of these guys pictures during the same time she was calling me out. I called her out on being a hypocrite and she admitted she was wrong. Thing is the girls photos i was liking I never had a sexual relationship with, where as the pictures she were liking were of guys she has slept with in the past. She was trying to reason with me that they are just her friends now and that she doesn’t talk to them often but she will like their photos on occasion with no ill intention.

What do you guys think? Should I just turn my head and continue doing my thing, or should i have a serious conversation about how she shouldn’t be liking peoples photos whos she slept with in the past. I feel like i am a little jealous, but at the same time don’t want to be controlling. Essentially I’m asking where should i draw the line?

Besides from those things, our relationship is great.. so not sure if these things are worth bringing up if everything else is good.

Thanks for those who made it this far, would really appreciate some advice! 

Tl dr/ 
Relationship of 2 years going strong
2 concerns-

1. white lies - gf wanted to grab lunch near her work
Planned to meet up tomorrow
She ends up cancelling because shes busy that day
Find out she went to that restarant today instead
I’d be okay if she just told me, instead tells me she brought lunch to work
I know she lied

Worth saying something or give her pass? reason why i know is because she shares location with me 

2. social media etiquette while in relationships

Gf insecure about me liking girls photos/ following exes on instagram year into relationship

I admitted i was wrong and unfollowed/ stopped liking pics

Month later, find out she has been liking dudes photos of guys shes met on bumble/ tinder, past flings/ guys shes dated. 

I called her out and she unfollowed them 

she still likes guys pics though and follows some of them

She thinks they are equivalent to me liking pics of rando girls

When she slept with these guys, I didnt sleep with these girls

I(M29) feel like I am not compatible with my SO(F30) due to different boundaries in our relationship relating to her sexual past. 

Sorry for this long post, I dont know where to go with it and I think I am about to break up with my SO. So we’ve been exclusive for a few months now. She is very very sexually experienced whereas I am kinky but still have a lot of things to tick off my bucket list. Her list is very short. We have really really great sex and I really enjoy spending time with her, and I believe she really likes me.

I have openly told her I’ve had jealousy/trust/insecurity issues in the past and that I dont want to be judgmental so the less I know the better but my problem here is that there are no boundaries for her and there is no privacy. I have this nagging feeling that we are not compatible as she has no lines, whereas I believe sex holds some level of importance and privacy in a relationship for me. 

A month back we went out for her birthday with her friends, many of whom are gay/lesbian. She disclosed in the early stages of us seeing each other that she has, in the past, had a MfM threesome with her gay (obviously clearly bisexual) best best male friend and I told her I felt nervous about being put in this environment and was worried about it. I've never had a threesome and although I would be very uncomfortable meeting this guy I wanted to try for her. She assured me it would be fine once I met him, and not to worry. It turns out he was pretty horrible to me and was very possessive over her and went out of his way to be really nasty to me. (My SO said she wasnt actually surprised by this as he can be very possessive of his GFs and has been mean to outsiders in the past - to me this is a completely toxic relationship to have with any ""friend"") On top of that a couple of friends openly made threesome jokes to make me feel awkward. She also jokingly made out with one of her female friends which was something I had previously said is something I don't think is cool and would be uncomfortable with but she was wasted. All in all it was a disaster for me. We fell out, I felt hurt that she crossed basically the only boundary I set out but mostly felt angry that her and her friends were throwing her sexual past in my face on purpose. It appears to me that the relationship she has with her friends is almost solely based on their sexualities and the sexual experiences they have separately or with each other. Sex makes up 85% of who they are. In my eyes this is immature. Something for a group of young university students - not 30 year old adults.

We talked it through, she apologised profusely for kissing her friend but didn’t think it was a big deal. She was also very angry that her friends had been nasty to me and made me feel awkward and said I wouldn’t ever have to meet them again if I didn’t want to. She really wanted to make it work. So we move passed it because I’m trying to be open minded, but I told her that I need some boundaries for us and I want our relationship to be us and not her telling stories of all the sexual adventures we get up to to this group of friends of hers. I dont want these friends who know every detail of her life (some of whom shes hooked up with) involved in our relationship.

Fast forward: I see on facebook she is tagged in an article about “rimming” by one of her openly sexual friends. (We have tried rimming twice but I know she has done it in the past as well). She then writes a responding comment by basically publicly stating how she loves it. Now this is not a private chat or post. This is a public article on a page post for all to see. I never went searching for it, it literally presented itself to me when on facebook. I feel like after everything that happened, that this might be the last straw for me. I can only be so open minded.

Either 
1. She has told all her friends how she done it with me (which I told her I didnt want) and is publicly announcing it. 
Or 
2. Is publicly announcing to her facebook for anyone to see how she enjoys rimming guys (again throwing her sexual past in my face and not giving a second thought to the fact shes now in a relationship with me)

Even if I wasnt in a relationship with her, I would never ever write/comment/post about such subjects on my public facebook. It wont have even crossed her mind how I might read that comment or how it might make me feel. 

Am I right to feel like this? I am not saying she is wrong. Many people out there are openly kinky, publicly talk about their past. But I have made it very clear that its probably the only thing that I struggle with and it continually gets thrown in my face and is like a weight on my shoulders. I'm sure theres guys out there who wouldnt care about this but I have clearly told her I do and hence I am now continually thinking we arent compatible. I’m going to meet her later tonight and I cant pretend everything is normal anymore. I will need to talk to her. ",relationships,I (M29) think this is my final straw for my relationship with SO(F30).

t2_16io85,1553784204.0,b6jmrb,t3_b6jmrb,15,"My boyfriend and I are really in love and happy, and I hope we spend our lives together. We were in the same friend group for the last couple years, which is a relatively wild friend group (various people are poly, LGBT, use some kinds of substances). And only a few months ago did we realize we had feelings for each other and we become a couple. All of our friends are so happy for us and it’s awesome.

Just one thing, is my boyfriend came into the friend group when our friend “Stella” had met him on an unsuccessful Tinder date. All I know is they probably went out once, it wasn’t a match, and now he’s been in the friend group ever since, after she invited him to a party after the date.

So I don’t know if they kissed, had sex, or what, before they became platonic. I know it doesn’t really matter, and he loves me SO much, and I trust both of them that nothing has been romantic between them ever since. I also feel like I’m setting myself up for a bad time whenever I ask him about it. What should I do? Is it better just not knowing?

t2_n09a2,1553848065.0,b6uoej,t3_b6uoej,8,"I wish I could keep this brief but I need to get into details to contextualize.

We’ve been together for four years. Our relationship has been kind of problematic since the beginning, but we’ve worked it out. The last year has been rather good and we’ve felt happier and fulfilled.

The biggest and most recurrent issue has been social media and girls. When I met him I realized he followed lots of Ig and Fb hot girls accounts, which I’ve always found disrespectful, uncomfortable, and heartbreaking to some extent. My arguments are that if you’re with someone you love and who you wish to spend your days with there’s no need to check out other girls; if you’re with the one you really love it shouldn’t be an issue to quit that and focus on the real side, real life. He following/liking those women made me feel like trash, unworthy and undesirable to the point I felt I needed to exercise more and look better and sexier for him (he never asked for this, complained or suggested it). This whole situation changed me.

We had lots and lots or arguments about this, even broken up many times over the same problem. His arguments are that it is not wrong to like/love hot girls pictures or follow them or so, that he’s not doing anything wrong and he’s not at fault in any way in our relationship because after all he wasn’t doing anything wrong. He loves me and he likes me all the same. He said that all those women are not real like he and I and that it was up to me whether I wanted to feel like crap.

After a couple of years later we tried to become more understanding with each other. He on the one hand deleted the accounts on Ig&amp;Fb and said he wasn’t doing it anymore, I on the other hand tried not to go check out his profiles to find this stuff, which would make him extremely angy.

I became extremely jealous not only because of the women he had on social media but also his girl friends and almost any woman he interacted with, and that was also damaging for our relationship. I lacked self-confidence. He became angry.

I’m used to telling my (ex)boyfriend about everything, though at one point I felt the need to keep some information from him for the fear of unleashing hell once again and for the fear of getting dumped. I felt guilty and uncomfortable. We ended up confessing we had kept secrets from each other. He called me a liar, and he said that if I was capable of lying, I could’ve been capable of more. This has hurt us deeper. 

About a month ago he began to suffer from panic attacks (we didn’t know what was happening to him). Turns out he’s been living with depression for a long time now. It’s been rough for the both of us. I’ve tried to support him in any way I’m capable to and to be there for him, I’ve tried to keep myself in line and not to fuck things up.

He’s been quiet and distant these days and I know he’s been going through a lot in his mind as well as emotionally. I care so much about him it drove me to the point of checking his twitter account for any hurtful or self-harming tweets or anything that could shed light on what’s been going on with him.

Nothing like that on his profile. I decided to go check his Reddit account (found it on a mention). I feared I would find stuff I wasn’t going to like (girls stuff). No sooner said than done. Curiosity killed the cat.

I went through his comments section and found out that most of this section was completely full of comments to porn u/. I read comments about perfection, how juicy, delicious and amazing they are, sexual wishes, and the list of that type of comments goes on and on. It's been like that for the period of time we’ve been together. Not to mention another comment on his smoking  saying he still does it (assured he’d quit long ago too).

This morning when I confronted him over the phone he said that he had kept checking that content trying to set me up because he knew I couldn’t quit stalking him and that he knew for sure that I would find his Reddit account to find this stuff and make a huge deal out of it, which hadn’t happened until last night. Turned out this was a lie too.

I was utterly disappointed, devastated and broken. I never thought I would end up feeling like this again. Not to this extent and for real. Every time that this thing about sexual/hot girls content comes up makes me feel like unworthy, even though I don’t consider myself an ugly, unsexy person. Men tend hit on me. But this issue is way too much for me to handle. I wonder if I’m overreacting and I’m wrong to think the way I do about these things. Am I?

We tried to talk and he said he knows he is wrong, but that he doesn’t believe that that part of him will ever change.
He doesn’t consider himself a perv as I once suggested over a fight, but it’s got to the point where I don’t find myself strong enough to accept it, overcome it and continue my relationship with him. I don’t feel I’m capable to accept the fact that he calls other women things he calls me in bed or even higher “compliments”. I don’t think I’ll ever find myself able to feel desirable for him to the extent he finds all these naked women on Reddit.

I love him like I’ve never loved anyone, I'm absolutely attracted to him and I’d pictured my life with him. I just don’t know what to do now. I don’t know if leaving him is the best option for the both of us like he suggested this afternoon, or I’m just overreacting and I should handle this and stay.

It's usually custom within my friends to say happy birthday as soon as the clock strikes 12. This year only my closest friend, who was on a video call with me, and my boyfriend, who I waa texting, wished me happy birthday at this time. I thought perhaps throughout the actual day I would get messaged from the others, but that never happened.

Specifically it was my highschool friends who we all share a group chat, and my birthday is the first in the year. There were some in my group that I sort of expected it from. But there's also my other best friend(K), who every year makes excuses that she has a terrible memory for birthdays yet never saves the dates in her phone (which I feel like is a sensible thing to do?).

The chat wasn't silent on my birthday either, everyone had messaged something at somepoint, K specifically fangirling over a band she likes. The next night after my birthday, K sends me the memory of a post she made for my 19th birthday, which is the last time she ever acknowledged my birthday on time or without a reminder. Even this time I can bet that she sent that because of a facebook memory.

After this I just feel pretty forgotten? The two who wished me happy birthday are the closest people to me, so it's not as traumatic as it could have been but this is still a hit on my self-esteem. I've felt really low the past few days due to overall depression and this keeps floating around in my head instead of going away. What makes me kind of bitter is knowing that the next birthday is two weeks away and because this girl is popular in the group that no one will forget.

Two weeks ago my boyfriend and I were having sex. Towards climax right when he tells me that he's getting close he pisses all over the bed. Tmi but I should clarify that he didn't piss on me, he was on all fours and I was fucking him from behind. I looked it up and it's something about the bladder and prostate being close to each other. 

He was very embarrassed about it after, which again to clarify the humiliation didn't turn me on. I have come to the conclusion that what turns me on is that my primate brain found it very hot that I literally fucked the piss out of him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When we first met, she was  in town for a few days and messaged me to get a drink. We immediately clicked and went back to my apartment, where we spent as much time as we could together during her  3 day trip.  Over the course of the next two years, she came back 4 or 5 times for work and always to stay with me while she was here. While she was here, we would be boyfriend and girlfriend for a week, having really steamy sex and intimate conversations, growing closer and feeling like a couple.  Then she would leave, and we would have our fifteen hour time difference, and only speak occasionally and date other people.  we wouldn't ask each other specifics about who we were talking to.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, I was swiping on tinder and met a few different girls that led to my first ever successful casual sex relationships.  It was very new for me and exciting, I was having really wild sex with girls that I barely knew, but it felt like in some ways the relationships were more transparent and honest than previous romantic ones I had had.  I was upfront about being in a long distance open relationship, and they were happy to not have the full pressures of dating but still meet up late at night to have sex a couple times a month. Then, when my girlfriend was in town, I felt like my heart was filled.  we had the most magical time, especially since time had started to pass and our friendship had grown into knowing each other for a couple of years.

&amp;#x200B;

It was fun to have things open, but I was eventually started feeling pretty empty on a deeper level.  I was happy for a period of time having casual sex and devoting the majority of my other time to my career, friends and hobbies, but I would alway be thinking about that girl on the other side of the planet who I had a much deeper connection with than anyone I was seeing where I lived.

&amp;#x200B;

then, I had an old friend pass away under surprising circumstances and it knocked my legs out from under me. I got blind drunk and was sobbing in my room wanting to die and she kept coming into my mind. I called her and told her I loved her.

&amp;#x200B;

it was the first time that I had said it to her, and it changed our relationship.  we started speaking more often, and taking each other more seriously. it was special, but I was still able to be having casual sex with previously mentioned girls without feeling remorse or less about her. It was my first time being able to experience different types of feelings for multiple people at one time, and it felt healthy.  That being said, my love for her was more important to me than the casual relationships, so when she asked me to be exclusive I happily accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next year we we fell very strongly in love and have told each other that we consider eachother soul mates.  We have talked about having kids, and she has even proposed to me ( she hasn't bought a ring tho lol)

There were some amazing stretches of time where we were able to be together and in pure joy, but there were also long stretches of us being apart that were very challenging and lonely.  There were two three month gaps in seeing each other, which honestly sucked so bad.  I was so lonely and horny, but would just jerk off to porn or we would have phone sex, but I was feeling so hollow sleeping alone and only connecting with someone so far away on such a unrewarding level.

&amp;#x200B;

The last time she came here was for three months, and it was finally the first time we have been able to really get used to eachother.  it was for the most part amazing. The only challenges came from her staying in my apartment which is also my workspace ( where I work with a few other people) and not being able to focus on myself as much as I should have with her here all the time.  (it was winter and a challenging time to be out of the apartment in her defense)

&amp;#x200B;

It was right after we had been together for a year, we got into a fight.  I had gotten some challenging news about work, and it upset me.  she took me being upset personally, and decided to sulk and huff for 24 hours. I was so upset by her insensitive response that I started to crave having the open relationship and going back to seeing multiple people.

&amp;#x200B;

After thinking about it for a few days, I decided to tell her about the nature of my casual relationships before we had become exclusive, and how I felt like sex can be practiced separately from love.  I told her about my previous relationships and how in the future, if we were going to remain long distance it might relieve some of the pressure for me if we opened our relationship up.

&amp;#x200B;

She did NOT like that. she was crying almost full time for a day or two, which was awkward while I was sharing the space with her and my roommate / co - worker.  It turns out that she doesn't see things similarly to me, she thinks women are manipulative and sneaky and will try to manipulate me into dating them exclusively instead.  she told me that in the past she had dated people who were in other relationships, and she would get off thinking about how their boyfriend was cheating on a girlfriend with her.

She told me she was too jealous to open the relationship up, but didnt want to lose me.  she said she would rather I cheat on her and her never find out than me open up the relationship officially.

I was  turned off by her lack of honesty in previous relationships, and feel like its her own fault for not trusting me to be in love with her.  I don't want to lose her, but I also don't want to stay exclusive and be so lonely when we are not together.

&amp;#x200B;

If I am on the verge of ending the relationship because I am desiring casual sex while we are apart which makes me feel sick to my stomach.  I hate seeing a girl I love slowly push me away by being jealous and possessive of me in ways she never was before we were exclusive. is it wrong of me to sneak and do that without telling her when its what she asked for?  I've never kept a secret from anyone in a relationship before, and I'm not sure that I want to start.  however, its sort of exactly what she asked for.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the weekend we texted a lot and then Monday we just hung out a lot more. I had never felt that close to someone, like she knew me and actually cared about what I was saying. Another week passes and things were going pretty good. I watched one of her favorite movies and teased her about it. And then in the middle of the week I went to the school concert that she was in, and when we were outside and she was walking with her mom. I walk up to say hi to her, and she said her hellos and left. Later that night I was in a restaurant with my friends and texted her about homework or something. Then the day after she didn’t answer one of my texts, okay no big deal, and then the next one. Then she just kinda made it clear she doesn’t want to talk to me. I tried talking to her to see what the hell happened, she was kinda flustered and ignored me. I let a month go by, radio silence from her. I let another month go by, she kinda recognizes my presence but doesn’t engage in conversation unless we’re in a group talking. Now flash forward to now. I have most of my classes with this girl and I wanna be able to talk to her again, but can’t out of fear. She seems kinda friendly to me in our photography class but once again that’s cause we’re in a group. I’m kinda lost and left missing her. Any ideas of how to deal with this situation?

She was with our kids (three kids total, aged 3-5 years) all week on spring break. She went 2 hours away to her parents for a visit.  I was home all week due to work.  She got home today around 4.  I called her on my way home around 5. 

When I called, I simply asked what we were going to do for dinner as I was hungry and wanted to bring something home.  I suggested Chipotle. She was “too tired to plan” and told me to just come home and we will discuss then.  I’m sightly annoyed because it’s I efficient but whatever. 

I get home.  The kids are asleep.  It’s not the typical nap time but they’re sick so it’s understandable and I don’t really care.  I tried to discuss dinner with her, but again she says she’s too tired and wants to take a 30 minutes.  

In the hour she was napping, I snack on some cheese and lunch meat.  I also get the kids up from their late naps.  Wife wakes up and is of course hungry now and I’m not.  

She orders herself Chipotle and some food for the kids and tells me she’s going to go pick it up. I’m annoyed at this point because I wanted Chipotle for dinner, but I filled up on cheese and lunch meat because she refused to plan wit me.   I say okay... 20 minutes goes by and she’s perplexed as to why I haven’t left to get the food.  Fine...I go pick up the food.  

When I return home, I’m pissy.  I’m annoyed that she refused to plan dinner with me or let me know what she was doing so I could plan around her.  I’m annoyed because of the lack of planning has made it such that it’s 8:30, the kids need to be bathed, and I need to leave the house by 4am tomorrow for work. 

I pretty calmly express my frustration. No yelling or anything but I’m curt.  I tell her I’m annoyed about dinner, I’m annoyed about it being so late and that 2 minutes of planning would have helped all of this. She she plops her chipotle in front of me and tells me to eat it because she’s not hungry anymore because “we don’t have a good marriage anymore.”  

All I want is for her to communicate her needs/desires/plans so we can plan accordingly together.  We both work full time.  We have three young kids.  It’s exhausting, I get it.  How do we plan better?  I’ve been asking for better communication for months.  Is it me at this point? 

FWIW, she has been with the kids at her parents house all week. I’m sure she’s tired.  She’s annoyed with me because I’m also tired I’ve clocked nearly 80 hours this week at work - did it to get caught up while she’s away.  I just don’t know how to get her to understand, I can’t anticipate her needs if she doesn’t communicate them.

t2_gm9rt,1553862635.0,b6wo0x,t3_b6wo0x,27,"# Background 
3 years ago when I and Clara dated we had seen that this relationship couldn't work out, and we agreed to end it. After then I found out that she has borderline personality disorder, and I have codependency and messiah complex. What is more complicated is that she follows Daoism, and I has a strong background in science. Daoism and science has many thing to share, but they also have a lot of criticisms towards each other. So basically we were a good match, both in personality and philosophy, but there were a lot of misunderstandings and prejudices between us, not to mention the personal issues of each. Without more knowledge we knew the relationship couldn't get to anywhere. 

Since the first criterion of the disorder is frantic avoidence of abandonment, she was very afraid of the breakup, even though she knew the relationship should be ended. She even had proposed a temporary breakup to make sure that we actually loved each other, but as long as we were still attaching, my codependency would still activate, and nothing would be fixed. So in order to make an efficient breakup, I decided to pretend to be super selfish, making her feel that I was not as qualified as she expected, and making her disappointed for choosing the wrong guy. By proactively making her think that she was the one who walked out from an unproductive relationship, I could protect her already fragile and hurtful heart, and to help her forget me. Without her move on my codependency will be a chain for me to actually work out the problem. This whole crazy thing also fits my messiah complex too. 

I should note that although this is both like sacrificing and gaslighting, it's not. I actually think the the past years are my personal time to learn more. I do feel that without this knowledge I'm not ready to enter any relationship, whether with her or anyone else.

# Problem
Now I have that knowledge, and is ready to get back. But move on is move on, and there is no need to fantasy about her love on me. She only needs to care about me when she has a strong need. I know what she needs too (explained later), but there are 3 major problems that have to be solved at once, and I can't seem to pass it:

- Due to the many failures from the past, especially after the relationship with me, she may have learned that it is impossible to achieve her needs, or have convinced herself that she doesn't need them at all.
- The combination of Daoism and BPD will make her feel that I will never understand her worldview. In fact, it is just confirmation bias.
- Because our problems is so complicated, I can't explain anything succintly in one shot. In fact, I suspect that it is possible at all. 

To explain more, one spirit of Daoism is to do something that looks ""stupid"", ""blindfold"", or ""selfish"", while in fact it is a thoughtful and selfless action. Depending on the specific person, it can create unnecessary misunderstandings or elaboration (my tendency) or superficial judgement or carelessness (her tendency). 

To avoid all of these hassles, I think it is best to ask her friends to tell her to talk to me. The problem is, how to do that either? I need to convince them, but they don't have time for that. Any of her friends (let's call her Mary) needs to have a strong interest in talking with me so that she can know why she should convince Clara, while in fact we haven't talked much yet. 

So we get to a funny situation, in that although I need to convince her, she needs to be motivated to work with me. After the talk she will want to say this to Clara:

&gt;I just have talked to Ooker, and I find it unreasonable that you ignore him. He is the one you need. You should go talk to him.

I know this sounds very much like manipulation, but I think I am being honest.

\*  *  *

Here are the problems she had hoped me to help her:

- To see the difference between real love and pseudo-love
- To be courage

Here are her trusts in our relationship:

- She felt that this relationship was peaceful, that the feeling she had with me was real love, and that she had put trust on the right one
- She wished that she could see life as simple as mine
- She believed that I could do something ""extraordinary"" 

Here are what made her realize that she loved me (and stop playing around with me):

- When she thought about what she had hurt me, her heart hurt

These are what she had said to me when we were in the relationship, but perhaps she has forgotten or even disbelieved in them. I have sent these to her, but she hasn't read it yet. Regardless her reaction, I still do what I need to do.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Background:**

I have been with Phillis for about 2.5 years, we live together and I have become essentially the stepfather to her 10 year old girl despite not being married as of yet.

We were introduced to each other by Bob and TwoFace (with the latter being Phillis friend).

I have a pretty close knit group of friends, Of which Bob and TwoFace are a part. Bob has been part of this group from the start (Talking like 20 years), TwoFace, only around 4 years or so and was brought into the group by being with Bob.

Phillis is also involved with this group of friends now, obviously brought in due to being with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Phillis has a group of 3 other friends that she has known for around 20 years also. The Caveat of that being that they didn’t speak to each other at all for about 12 years, due to Phillis being bullied pretty badly by them and her eventually getting sick of it and cutting of contact. They started speaking again about 4-5 years ago (Before Bob and TwoFace were together). They all have a group chat going on a phone app where they arrange nights out etc. She sees them maybe once every two months. The conversations are usually along the lines of them arranging a night out between themselves where they want to go for drinks, then after they’ve got a date/time/location set they ask Phillis to come (and drive, pick them all up from their 3 different towns, take them to where they are going, not drink, then take them all home). She often can’t, because she is at full time uni and works part time on evenings/weekends.

They will then have a huge go at her that she ‘doesn’t care about them’ and ‘never comes out’.

They have had her in tears more than once since I've been with her and when she does got on a night out with them, she is sick to her stomach with anxiety about 50% of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Stage is set:**

Phillis and her friends were talking a couple of months ago about there being a concert coming up and that they would all try to get tickets to it (I am unaware of this conversation at this time). Phillis asked me if I wanted to go to this concert, I said yes.

Flash forward to ticket release day, I am trying to buy tickets (from work), so is Phillis (from home). She manages to get a pair of tickets and so do I. I find out that a couple of close friends from this group didn’t manage to get tickets and I offer them to them.

These guys are really close with both me and Phillis, we go on weekend breaks with them, they always buy gifts for the kid, always make effort with us, are genuinely nice people. Recently we booked to go away with them and another couple we know. These guys paid for the entire thing (flights, accommodation, car hire etc) on their credit card to make things easier for everyone and didn’t even want the money off of anyone till CC interest etc was due.

&amp;#x200B;

I have quite a commute home, by the time I get back, it has come to light that;

* TwoFace and Bob have got tickets.
* Cheater and Stevie have got tickets, and 2 extra.
* Orange did not manage to get any before they sold out, but wants 2 (despite the fact that Beef doesn’t want to go).

&amp;#x200B;

Phillis asks if we can give my tickets to Orange, and I tell her that I’ve already offered them to our friends. I tell Phillis who and she agrees and suggests that we don’t ask for any money for them as a thankyou for all they’ve done for us recently.

**NOTE:** Phillis has not offered or promised these tickets to Orange, she just assumed that she could have them and Phillis said she would ask me about it.

At this point, all shit kicks off in this group chat, they hurl about at Phillis calling her worse than shit, that she doesn’t care about them, isn’t a true friend, is ruining Oranges plans by not giving her the tickets. They then start to tell her to give one of the tickets she has for me and her to Orange and that it’s my fault for giving mine away, Phillis can do what she wants with her tickets. She’s known them longer, should respect them more. This goes on from 6pm, until 11:30pm while Phillis is trying to complete a Uni assignment that is due in in a couple of days. The abuse they give her gets so bad that she ends up in tears and I ask what’s going on. After some persuading I finally get her to show me the messages they have been sending her.

TwoFace has not offered to give up one of her tickets and not go with her husband (but is expecting this of Phillis). Cheater has not offered ANY of her tickets to Orange despite having 4 and being fully on board with Phillis not going with me also.

*Disgusted* is the only work that comes to mind. These people are acting like teenagers in a school yard. Straight up bullying Phillis about this and calling her worse than shit.

To say that I lost my shit is an understatement.

TwoFace is the only one I have any contact information for. I message her on FaceBook and very politically say that I know it’s not her doing it (it most definitely was) but that I want the bullying and digs at Phillis to stop. This is all over a set of tickets that I bought anyway and they had no say over them and wouldn’t be getting any tickets off of us.

She decides to go to bed. Cheater finally offers Orange her tickets.

Orange says that everything is sorted now.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, Orange and TwoFace have both talked to Phillis normally, although Cheater has not spoken to her at all. Phillis have even seen TwoFace a couple of times in person (both with and without me there) and she was absolutely fine with her. Sharing bottles of wine and smoking together.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Final Act:**

Weeks have passed with nothing said about this.

&amp;#x200B;

This week, Phillis gets a private message from Cheater saying that her, Orange and TwoFace have been talking about her and have decided that the 3 of them need a chat with her. Phillis asks what about, because both TwoFace and Orange have spoken to her and are fine with her, but that is Cheater wants to talk things out, she is more than welcome to meet up.

Cheater declines to see her alone and says that all 3 of them are there or she will not speak to her.

At this point TwoFace posts a long abusive message in the group chat, telling Phillis that ‘something is wrong’ with her and she isn’t giving her old friends the respect they deserve.

Phillis offers to talk to them in our house, and will even ask me to go out for the night. They say no, they want her in a pub or restaurant, not in her own house.

Orange chimes in that she and Cheater are not bullies and that *Frank* (Me) must be a bully. Then the 3 of them start getting on at her with things like;

* “Are you scared of him?”
* “Does he not let you do what you want?”
* “Does he not let you see your friends?” (To which she replies, truthfully, that I am the one who encourages her to see her friends despite her having little free time and usually being exhausted from Uni/Work. This is because I think having friends that you both have asa couple, and that you have as your ‘own’ is important)
* “Don’t take him to the concert, put your foot down, show him whos boss.”
* “You’re in an abusive relationship, don’t let him do this to you.”
* “If Beef did that to me, I’d throw him out.” (Orange doesn’t work and lives in Beefs house rent free, just as an amusing aside)
* “You shouldn’t show other people what we say in here.”
* TwoFace- “I couldn’t speak to you about this by myself while there were other people there”
* And the kicker that “We think this friendship is done unless you tell him to pack his bags”.

All over them not getting tickets to a concert, they are trying to get Phillis to ruin her (our) relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Phillis tells me, shows me the messages and is FURIOUS about what they are doing. But she has also been in tears a few more times, hasn’t been sleeping and is generally stressing out about it. She is sometimes too nice for her own good and always wants to be friends with everyone/see the good in people.

&amp;#x200B;

From my point of view, I’m furious due to the fact they’ve just started making shit up about Phillis and I’s relationship, which, thanks to TwoFaced being connected to our close-knit group of friends, could end up getting out as a rumour. It’s also not something I would want anyone to think was true about me, even for a second.

&amp;#x200B;

TwoFace has also messaged Phillis since in a private chat to ask if she is OK, saying that things went a bit too far in the group chat.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Afterword:**

I’m not really sure why I’m posting this. I don’t see a solution or resolution to it, but I hate seeing Phillis in this state. I want her to be happy and to have her own friends, but these people seem like disgusting, immature, toxic people that only seem to bully her/make her cry. It seems like they are angry that she is sticking up for herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also now in an awkward situation with Bob, I don't want this to impact our friendship, but I also don't want his wife telling him made up shit about me. I don't want to bring it up with him, because we have always had the agreement that what happens between the girls stays between the girls. But this is some next level bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

But I guess seeing what other people think in an anonymous forum could be good?

3. I find it really difficult to talk to him about philosophical/political issues and problems with our relationship. this is partially my fault because I dont know how to bring them up and im a bit shy about expressing my opinions, but he can be a little combative which doesn't help. he's very supportive with emotions/mental health though.

In '77 the previous owner added an 1.5 story addition on the back of the original brick house. They drywalled over a window between the original and the addition, and while pulling back drywall we found quite a bit of rot. For all intents and purposes, I'm treating this as an external wall as the original home and addition each have their own roofs.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is an rough drawing of what I'm working on repairing. [https://imgur.com/a/FBa2mh5](https://imgur.com/a/FBa2mh5)

Basically, the 2x6 window header, as well as the double top plate that sits on top of it, is completely shot, near crumbling. This was caused by a leak in the roof which we have just replaced so the water source has been fixed.  


Anyway, I'm wanting to replace the 2x6 header and the section of top plate that is rotted, but I'll have to detach two rafter ends and ceiling joists from it to get it out. (The ceiling joist ends and rafter ends are nailed together, but obviously I'll need to cut them from the top plate to replace it)  


Just wanting to know what all I need to consider here. Is there any issue with cutting the rafter end from the top plate while I fix this?  


On the other side of this closed in window is a small full bathroom. Not a ton of room to work in, but I was planning to support the ceiling joists on the other side of the window wall with a temp stud wall and two bottle jacks.

Any thoughts are much appreciated. Thanks all!",DIY,Repairing Rotted Double Top Plate on Exterior Wall - Looking for Advice.

Background on this, it’s had a slight leak since I bought the house but never more than just some drips inside on the window. It started getting worse this winter with water coming in bad enough to warp the window trim, but it always only came in and down the window glass, so I had the window replaced by a professional. 

After the new window was in water started coming in through the ceiling, called the window installer - he recommended I replace the gutters to make sure water was staying off the window entirely. Sooo i had a professional come in and replace the gutters. Which worked - for rain. Now any time the snow is melting I experience this problem with water coming in the ceiling. 

I know for sure I’m going to need to rip out and replace the ceiling/insulation ASAP but I also need to stop the water so that the new material isn’t ruined too. I’m out of ideas on what to do. How do I stop this? ",DIY,"[help] how do I fix this? Water leaking in ceiling above window. Water used to come in on the face of the window, so I replaced the window.

I have a balcony door with a metal handle, it had been a bit wobbly since moving in and came off at the end of last summer, you can see from the pics that I tried to fix it with gorilla glue, shockingly that was unsuccessful and came off shortly after. Through winter it hasn't really been a problem as it's been freezing but I'd like to get this sorted for when summer comes back around.

Pics here:
http://imgur.com/gallery/QVnHR37


I'm not sure where the issue in the mechanism lies, it looks like the metal point screw thing is supposed to dig into the square that runs through the middle of the handles and secure it in place, but when I screw it in it's completely loose, I think the square thing has come too far apart and is no longer gripping the screw.

Anyone with any experience of these types of handles able to offer some advice on how I can repair it? Or does it need replacing, if so do i need to replace the whole thing or are the metal square things sold by themselves? 

Edit: just to note I have tried searching this sub and Google but was struggling to find anything related to this type of handle

1. A support piece, maybe a 2x2 (?) stretching the length of it.
2. Mounting a pipe just under the board with the same concept as 1 but stronger.
3. Buying a ""Table Top Stiffener"" to span most of the length of the table.

We are not sure if the stiffener would be effective since it wouldn't tie to the sides. Also we cannot add a support at the base of it because of the supports on our bed frame. Any and all advice is appreciated

I am planning on using timberlocks to connect to my posts.  Kind of the same question goes for my ledger board.  If I use 2 - 12' instead of a 1 - 24', would that mean water would be more likely to get behind the ledger board since there is a seam in the middle?

however, i recieved 8.1mm oversized hole, so i couldn't use it... too much runout.  


took over a month for it to arrive, wasn't going to wait again.  


based on google and forums er collet chucks have 8 degree internal taper angle  


my compound was not gonna have the accuracy required,  


so i used a bevel protractor to get the precision within 0.1 degrees, which for ER collets is enough  


even greater precision could be set, if i purchased electronic bevel protractor, but it would cost me over $600 for quality one.  


i just went with vernier one, which wasn't too bad.

I’m currently 39 years old. I’ve been with my wife, let’s call her Janet, since I was 20. When Janet and I first got together, I was the jealous type. She was (still is) smoking hot and instead of being appreciative of a having sexy gorgeous woman on my arm, I’d get mad if I saw other guys looking at her. To put it in perspective, one day fairly early on in our relationship, we went to the beach. On the way home, Janet continued to wear her bikini top. I was seeing guys in other cars trying to ogle her and I got upset and told her to put a shirt on. She didn’t like that. That was the type of stupid shit that started steamrolling out of control. I was wrong. I don’t dispute that. I have insecurities apparently. 

During the first few months of being together, one of her ex-Bfs came into the picture. They were “just friends” is what she had told me so they talk sometime. I wasn’t ok with it and it started arguments more often than not. Eventually my insecurities and possessiveness became too much and we split up. Long story short, she ending up spending a night at his house. During our split, I ended up meeting up with one of my ex’s. When I was with my ex, we talked for a bit and literally NOTHING happened. I realized I didn’t want my ex, I wanted Janet. Janet and I ended up getting back together after about two weeks. I wasn’t happy about what she had told me had happened while we were split but what could I do about it. We technically weren’t together at the time. I promised to change. She believed me. 

Somewhere in the mix, I met a girl at work and started talking to her. Not gonna lie, I wanted to hook up with her but we never did. I ended up telling Janet about it,  and apologized. She was pissed. We fought for a while and ended up trying to fix things. Shortly after that, she told me she was moving to FL to be with her sick mom who was also moving to FL. At the time, we lived in New England. She told me I could come or we could split up but either way, she was going. I decided to leave the only home I’ve ever known and move 1200mi. away with Janet. This was in 2003. 

Once in FL, it was her and I. After paying for the move, we had $400 to our name. We both got jobs and started building our life together. I was still getting jealous over stupid things but kept telling her I’d change and she kept believing me. I really wanted to change and I did for a while. 

Things got real good for us. We both had decent paying jobs and we had a relationship that all our friends were jealous of. We got married in 2007 and in late 2008, had our first child. A beautiful baby girl. After our daughter was born, I was putting in 50+ hours a week at my job and a lot of those hours were night hours where I didn’t get home to close to midnight. My wife, on the other hand, worked Mon-Fri 9-5. We weren’t spending as much time together and apparently she felt like I wasn’t helping out with our daughter as much as she’d like me to have.

While my daughter was about 1, my wife started taking to a guy at her job. Once I found out about it, I was heart broken and confronted the guy. He told me he didn’t want to come between my wife and I and that he was sorry and he wouldn’t talk to my wife anymore. That was the truth. They stopped talking and my wife and I were left to try to fix our relationship. Apparently it didn’t last too long bc she started talking to yet another guy at her job. This guy was married and also had a child about our daughters age. Once I found out about this, I was livid. We fought and at one point, she ended up leaving for two weeks to stay with her mom. Before she left, though, I had tried to confront the new guy she was talking to but he avoided me like the plague. My last resort was to track down his address and go talk to HIS wife. His wife acted like she wasn’t too surprised and like it wasn’t a big deal. Either way, they stopped talking I think. Who knows. 

Fast forward a couple months and I find yet ANOTHER guy at her job was trying to talk to her. I confronted him, too.  My wife didn’t do anything really wrong here per-say, but she didn’t tell me someone else was trying to talk to her. 

Fast forward to today. Since all that BS happened, it’s been close to 10 years. Our daughter is 10 and we also have a 5 year old son now, too. I love both my kids more than life itself. I’m also still head over heels in love with my wife but I do not know how to let go of the past. I do not 100% trust her and I don’t know how to get over that. I honestly don’t want to be with or have eyes for anyone else but her. But she’s tired of me not fully trusting her. 

I WANT to trust her. I really do but I don’t know how to. It’s been 10 years since all that but she still works with that one guy who’s wife I had to talk to. I don’t think anything is going on but I don’t know how to stop thinking that something is. 

My mind works in fucked up ways. If I don’t hear from my wife on her lunch break, my mind automatically thinks she’s somewhere with him. Or if she has to leave the house to go to the store, I automatically think she’s running off to secretly meet someone. 99% of the time, I keep these thoughts to myself or I’ll ask subtle questions to see what she’s up to. I don’t want to feel this way. Occasionally, I’ll say something stupid and she’ll know that I don’t trust her. At this point, she’s tired of living like this and is contemplating leaving. We’re about to start counseling together so I’m really hoping that it can help us/me. How do I get over my insecurities and trust my wife again 100%. How do I stop these thoughts that I have. Let’s be clear, I don’t think she is doing anything right now with anyone but my mind automatically jumps to that all the time.  I hate being this way and feeling like this but at the same time, I seriously don’t want to be with anyone else but her.

There’s more I can get into but for the time being, I think this sufficiently explains our current situation. 

Please fell free to ask my any questions or if you want me to be more specific about anything I said. I’ll be 100% honest about everything.  

TLDR: I’ve had jealously problems for my whole almost-20yr relationship with my wife. She’s “cheated” on me in the past and I don’t know how to get over it for her sake and mine. I do not want to be like this. How do I overcome this?

t2_3hr7hbhs,1553723895.0,b6afbm,t3_b6afbm,84,"My boyfriend is... ‘strange’, for lack of better words. Not in a bad way, just he has his little harmless quirks and I don’t have a problem with any of them. It’s all part of what makes him as a person and I love him, quirks and all.

Although one thing he does (that has started to become more frequent) is his apologizing. It’s not like this is a new thing, but it’s starting to bother me and I feel awful for snapping at him whenever he apologizes.

Like I said, it’s not a new thing. We met online (he used to live in the Netherlands) and we were talking for a few years before he came to visit me. The first thing I said when I saw him was something like “wow you’re taller than I thought you would be” (not word for word but something like that... he’s 6’1) and his immediate response was to apologize?

I dunno. I thought it was cute and I assured him that it was fine and that he doesn’t have to apologize for his height ? A little strange, but cute.

He would apologize for things that he really doesn’t have to apologize for. Like something that happens frequently would be when we’re on a date and he’d have to use the bathroom. He’d apologize, excuse himself, give an explanation, apologize again, do his business, come back, and then apologize again.

Like. He doesnt have to apologize for using the bathroom, much less apologize 3 times. I already explained to him that he doesn’t have to apologize so much (or apologize at all) for taking care of a basic human need and he’d just go “oh. sorry.”

It’s starting to get a little frustrating. Fast forward a few years and we now live together (in an apartment) and oh my gosh he apologizes *so* much for little to no reason.

Like I’d just. Point out little things. Not in an angry / annoyed or accusing tone, just as an observation. Like “oh, you ate the last cookie” or “its your turn to make dinner tonight” would result in a bunch of apologies, “it’ll never happen again op”, etc. etc.

It bothers me because his apologies are 100% genuine. You can tell he feels really bad even though there’s nothing to be sorry about.

It’s something my parents / sister has noticed too apparently. They weren’t bothered by it, just a little concerned, asked if he was okay. My sister joked that if she didn’t know me / how our relationship is, she would assume that I’m abusing him or something.

I don’t know if this is related, but he tends to get startled easily. He’d flinch / jump if I make any sudden movements (and then apologize for it). Whenever I ask him if he’s okay, he’d say that he’s fine, apologize for worrying me etc.

I can’t tell if I’m annoyed or concerned. Like, I’m kind of concerned at this point because now its beginning to be a bit much, but annoyed because I really don’t understand what’s going through his mind, why he feels that he has to apologize so much.

We never fight, I don’t raise my voice at him, I don’t hit him. All of these things (the apologizing, the flinching) has been there since the start of our relationship, only it’s been getting worse. He won’t talk about it. He always says that he’s fine:

Should I [20F] pay my roommate  [24F]  for shared essential items 

Recently I've [20F] moved in with my bf [21M] and another couple[24F+21M]. The other couple picked the apartment, got everything situated, brought furniture, Appliances, cleaning supplies, toilet paper, food, etc. Then me and my bf moved in. We even went on a airbnb for valentine's day. They probably  altogether spent $1000 or $1500 on it if I had to guess give or take. 
my boyfriend and I pay them for bills each month utilities, electric, cable, rent. We don't share food but we share everything else. 

I feel guilty and it's weighing on my conscious a lot. I DO NOT like oweing people anything. It makes me extremely uncomfortable. I texted my roommates saying I'd like to pay them back for anything but they did not respond at all. They keep to themselves a lot and me and my bf keep to ourselves as well . My bf said not to pay them back for it because they choose to buy the things. And when we do move out me and my bf are not taking any of that shared items with us. Everytime I look at the pan were cooking in or using the broom I feel so conflicted using things I did not pay for. But I just hate thinking this is something that could be held over my head something as simple as money. 
Should I pay them back or just leave it alone?  Whatever decision I make I'm sticking to it I can't keep feeling this way.

t2_3i09uage,1553819601.0,b6qp7r,t3_b6qp7r,6,"Background: We're a M/M couple. I'm 20, boyfriend is 24. Been dating for 2.5 years. We also live together.

We've had sexual issues before like any couple but the most recent one is getting annoying. There's been some resentment between boyfriend and I due to financial difficulties, and he's unwinding in unhealthy ways.

E.g. yesterday, we were having sex and he kept thrusting faster even though I told him I was feeling uncomfortable and my leg was kind of cramping. He didn't even care though, just continued doing what he was doing because he was ""too close to stop"". It's not that I wanted to stop, I just needed him to slow down and have some consideration. I wasn't even done by that point.

However, he completely ignored my words and comfort just so that he could have his orgasm. After he was finished, we argued and he snapped and said it wasn't his fault that I take so long to come. He blamed me for being too passive (a.k.a. his issue with my reluctance to leave a low-paying job - but it's complicated).

So I took a few toys and went to the bathroom to take care of my orgasm. He was in an extremely bad mood and acted like a child the whole evening just because I masturbated. He has a theory that I can't come fast enough because I'm too used to jerking off with toys. When actually, I can't finish because my boyfriend's inconsiderate and therefore awful in bed.

t2_39mgshcp,1553805974.0,b6o35e,t3_b6o35e,9,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for about a year now. We see each other daily because he’s been staying with me for the past 2 months. He’s very logical about everything. I feel like he lacks empathy. I’m more emotional I’m very empathetic. Anytime we get into a disagreement he ignores me. Most of the time I’m the one that reaches out to him to try and solve a relationship problem. He then acts like nothing happened the problem is past us. I always want to talk about it to try and solve the issue so it doesn’t happen again. Most of the time he gets very frustrated and ignores me so I just stopped trying to bring things up and let them go much quicker now. He used to tell me he’s never been in a relationship where he’s “fought this much” to me they aren’t fights. These are disagreements that I’m trying to solve! I’m letting him know how certain things he does make me feel. For example just today we were moving a floor jack and I noticed a nail sticking out of the handle so I immediately removed it and he spoke to me like I was an idiot. His tone changes and it makes me feel like an idiot. The way he usually does when I do something that he doesn’t approve of. It turns out the nail was in place to keep the handle from coming apart (the original bolt was missing). I just removed it because it looked like a safety hazard. That was my thinking. He said I should be more aware before I do things. I just feel that everything I do has to be up to his standards. He’s a perfectionist he has to be in control of his work and I feel like sometimes he unintentionally tries to control me. 

Just a few things he’s snapped about in the past...he was upset that I ripped a bag with our meal instead of untying it. The bag had a tight knot and I was hungry! He wanted to reuse the bag I didn’t know this until after the fact. Or when I placed his MacBook charger (while plugged into the wall) on his pile of clothes. He spoke to me like I was an idiot and said it was a dangerous place to put it. He hates how I drive and says I’m a bad driver. (My father no longer complains about my driving! He used to when I was 20) None of my friends have complained to me about my driving. 

He’s not as bad as he was before but now I just feel that I don’t want to put up with his neuroticism at all! Please tell me if I’m wrong here. 

I also feel that these are huge triggers for me because growing up my dad used to be this way not to this extreme but he just made me feel like I was an idiot for misplacing his things or getting upset with my mom when she cleaned and moved his things around. I’ve also had issues with self esteem and always wanting to major in science but always thinking I wasn’t smart enough to do it. I know my boyfriend cares about me but sometimes I feel like he’s too hard on me. I feel like he wants this perfect partner and I want someone that just understands me. 

TL;DR: Am I wrong for feeling like I don’t want to deal with his criticism and questioning our relationship or am I being too dramatic?

t2_3hyu8p3g,1553805779.0,b6o1lr,t3_b6o1lr,5,"My mother always had very high standards which lead to a lot of arguing. I was never allowed to make normal 'child' mistakes. I got a long list of chores and if I didn't complete it to 100% perfection then came the yelling. And I could never do anything perfectly for her.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I was 'gifted'. My parents took me to a lot of psychologists and professors who IQ-tested me and I started school 2 years early. I enjoyed learning, and tbh I enjoyed being told what a super clever, special kid I was. But the age difference meant that I wasn't really accepted in my class and always had very few people who would even talk to me. My mother made sure I could have many hobbies and actively supported me, but only in the things she thought worthwile.

&amp;#x200B;

As I grew older, it became clear to me I was growing up to be a very different person than her. Where she is all about cleanliness, I am messy and disorganised (I  have ADD, so....). Where she is practical and always eager to tackle work, I am laid back and clumsy. We have almost nothing in common. I'm depressed and don't have a lot of mental energy, and have largely abandoned my creative hobbies which disappoints her further. I think she expected that I would stay on the track to be this super wonder child and probably write my first bestseller with 12 or something. Instead I have turned to partying, music that she doesn't like and sports, but just for fun, not competition.

&amp;#x200B;

She never kept it a secret that she is disappointed in the way I 'turned out'. Just a few weeks ago she told me I could be more attractive if I tried, I could make more out of myself etc, I am abnormal for being single and will probably die alone, and that even when I was a kid she never knew 'what to do with me'. Now, I am used to that kind of talk and usually it would just roll off my back, but for some reason this time it really hit me. We had a huge argument which ended with me telling her to leave my place and not contact me again. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's now been one month and for some reason this time reality is really setting in for me. I think I've finally lost hope that we could ever have a good relationship, and that it's better if we have next to no contact, but also recognizing this has pushed me further into depression. I really struggle to accept once and for all that she thinks so badly of me. Probably made worse by the fact that she is now trying to make up and has sent me voice messages where she is crying about how she knows she wasn't a good mom etc... but I just cannot forget all the insults and hurtful things she has hurled at me. It feels like talking to her again would be pure hypocrisy knowing what a failure she thinks I am.

&amp;#x200B;

This last week I've barely had the strength to get out of bed in the mornings and I cry every night. Although I know that she isn't 'right' about it I now struggle with all these feelings of being a failure that don't even really come from me, but I guess I've absorbed them over 24 years of being around her. I am in therapy but I don't feel like my therapist really understands what I'm talking about most of the time and I've already switched therapists twice.

Ex \[m24\] of 6 months broke up with me \[f28\] last saturday out of the blue. I suspected something was going on but never something that would lead to a drastic outcome like this. Just last month he had told me he loved me. Days after saying it he had an appendicitis and I welcomed him into my home for recovery and drove him to all his appointments. A week later he went to stay at his grandmother's and then went back to work. This is when things started to get shady. He went from being a guy who would text me everyday even just to say hi to barely texting. Whenever I would reach out to see if he was ok he would be very short and distant and then started flaking on me. He would make plans then leave me hanging, no text no nothing to say plans changed. I started to worry something was wrong and questioning if maybe I had done or said something wrong. When I left for the weekend with my friends; I never heard back from him after he had texted me the day before to ask me if i wanted to hang out. I opened IG and saw he posted a selfie, which was so out of character. Since meeting him, he had no interest in social media so it seemed off that he would start now. It made me feel upset because he didn't have time to tell me plans were cancelled but has time to post a selfie?

I called him out on it and was hoping to discuss things with him, but when i texted him that was when he decided to drop the bomb that he was going out to sea and would be back in a week. Normally he would always be on top of things like that and let me know ahead of time but I felt like if I wouldn't have texted him he wouldn't have let me know.

When he returned he messaged me saying he missed me and would text me asking what I was up to. He planned a date for us this past saturday and I was so excited to see him since it had been a month since we physically saw each other. I got dolled up, he picked me up, met my mother for the first time, and took me out for coffee. In the car he joked about future plans with me and everything seemed great. However at the coffee shop that was when he decided to tell me he wanted to break up because he felt guilty. Guilty that he couldn't dedicate enough attention to me and that he's not sure he can keep up a relationship because of the navy schedule and his upcoming deployment in January 2020. Since we met, I knew this wouldn't be a normal relationship. I always tried my best to never pressure him for more than what he could give, be it time wise or relationship wise.

I'm so confused. I understand not feeling like you can balance both but it really made me feel like I was played. How does a person go from I love you last month to sorry I can't commit to you because XYZ is coming up and I have to stop and put gas on wednesdays, and tie my shoes in november. It seems like such a BS excuse to me.

What's worse is that we had sex right after (stupidity on my end) and continued to text the rest of the weekend and he said he wants me in his life and his last text to me said he missed me and something about take backs which I'm not sure was a joke or not. I told him I wouldn't settle for less than gf and if he can't handle a relationship with me then how can he handle a friendship. There is no point especially because his schedule will never change, it will always be demanding and life will always pile on things. Finding balance is part of adulthood.

I can't decipher if he is being sincere and his reason for the breakup is genuine and if I am being selfish for not wanting to let this end. Especially when he had told me that same day in the car he saw the a future with me. He was the one that chased me for months and asked me to be his gf so I'm so confused what's changed all of a sudden?

I've gone no contact and it's only day 3 since we last talked, but i'm in so much pain and confused about what the hell just happened. I'm also worried I may possibly be pregnant since I was ovulating at the time according to my calendar.

Am I being selfish for firmly believing that if you truly love someone you tackle obstacles together and refusing to believe his excuse and refusing to stay by his side as a friend?

t2_doqtg,1553790708.0,b6kyyu,t3_b6kyyu,1,"Long post, TL;DR at the bottom.

Well, I’m getting some help already. Going to talk therapy (psychodynamic, which means my therapist doesn’t really talk back a lot), and reading a book about core beliefs and attitudes in life, and how that affects relationships. I think I intellectually know most parts of this puzzle. But this shallow awareness isn’t helping me move towards better relationships.

For example, I have many friends, about 2000 on Facebook, but to be honest I don’t really feel close to any of them. I have a handful of friends that I spend time with more or less regularly, and it’s the same there. I might be wrong, but I don’t think any of them would call me as their go-to person in a crisis or emergency. It makes me feel very lonely and sad, even though I’m rarely alone, and usually very social, mostly happy, have many interests, and like to joke around. 

In intimate relationships, I’ve noticed a pattern. I tend to first idolize, then grow dispassionate, bored, or even disrespectful and neglecting towards my partner. Out of my seven “serious” relationships, the longest was 18 months. 
The feeling of being in love usually lasts about 2-4 weeks for me. The remainder of the relationship is usually a struggle where I try to find that same feeling again, forcing it, and ending up anxious for not being able to reciprocate the love I get from her(although, I actually seem to not be able to take that love in...). Being intimate is somewhat scary to me, and I’ve never dared to look a partner in the eyes to say I love you, because I wouldn’t speak the truth. But even if I did love her, I think I wouldn’t dare. 

In general, I seem to want something from people when I interact with them. For sure I am generous at times, in a genuine way, but mostly I tend to see people as a means to an end. Not in a full blown psychopathic/narcissistic way maybe, but I don’t recall ever being really interested in anyone else than me. This fact makes me very ashamed, I hate that I’m self absorbed by default, and I don’t know how to shake it off.

I tend to over analyze things, and this issue seems so complex to me. I don’t know where to start. A bunch of different factors dance around in patterns on different levels. But I don’t know how to see it clearly. Or how to step out of it. Must I be interested in people? Why can’t I feel really close or intimate with people? Why do I always put people higher or lower than myself, never feeling equal? Why do I see people as a means to an end?

TL;DR: I’m a 25 yo dude with many friends and relationships yet I don’t feel close or intimate with anyone, never have. Been self absorbed my whole life, but deeply longing connection.

He is generally socially akward and tried to be my friend for 3 years, most of which I spent flaking out on things he invites me to and pretending I didn't get his phone calls. He also occasionally said dumb stuff I just couldn't ignore, like brining in a picture of a parrot to hold up whenever I laughed ""because my laugh sounds like a parrot"" and talking about his shower habits unprompted and out of context.

Flash forward to about a month ago. I learn that a mutual friend hasn't had as many changes luck ignoring him as I had in the past few months and it turns out he has been borderline harassing her. It's obvious he likes her as well and also she's my romantic interest but that's not what this is about.  Anyway me and a friend decided to confront him about it. Here is what he did for context:
-Stalking
-Awkwardness in journalism
-constant requests to meet in person
-weird compliments
-apalogized for thinking she was fragile???? Which he had never told her he thought up until the apology in the first place???
- said  you’re number 3 smartest  person I know so I want to get a better friendship with you (also she is Uber self conscious about grades and was disappointed she got third smartest freshman in the school officially so that was a close to home blow
-oblivious to any social signals
- he also asked what clubs she was in specificly to join those clubs 
- he gave her a panic attack by coming to one of said clubs.


Finally the day of the confrontation rolled around and I was the one who told him to meet my friend and I after school to talk. I couldn't come and bailed at the last second because of ride home shenanigans. It went as expected apparently, with him mostly deflecting and he agreed to stop bothering her, however maintaining it wasn't his fault. Later, he called me. He was mad and talking about how he felt betrayed. Everything he said could be condensed to a few main points:
How could you do this to me?
-You are weak for not telling me to f*** off from the get go
-I did nothing wrong
Then the kicker: 
- you - unlike your friends (the one who confronted him and the girl) have no disorders to hide behind why didn't you tell me you didn't like me??? 
The called ended with me telling him I want nothing to do with him anymore, and for a while he respected that. Untill track rolls around. Luckily he is a distance runner and the distance and sprinters are pretty separate but still. He thinks we are friends again? Pretty soon after he joined he asked if I wanted us to just ignore each other. I said yes. He gave a bit of a non apology saying he hadn't meant to hurt anyone but not actually saying sorry.

So apologies in advance if you’ve seen my many posts about my bf. I deleted them because I think he comes on here...

In the past month, my bf has canceled 3 dates, left for a weekend during our standing date, hasn’t been verbally affectionate- basically has been talking and texting like I’m just a friend, although when we are together he’s very affectionate... I’ve seen him probably 4 times the past month. He has apologized for being distant a few weeks back saying he has been stressed out. Yesterday, when he canceled our date last night, he said he hardly has time anymore. After the cancellation, he didn’t even bother suggesting another day to see each other, and in the past, he has. So I’m taking this as he has checked out and the relationship is over, or has been for a while. I mentioned in the text that this has felt one sided and he no longer suggests days. He counteracted saying he was going to suggest such and such day, but has a lot of chores backed up (knowing damn well I will have my kids that day, so it was just a tactic to get me to believe he’s putting forth some effort). I responded saying I have my kids until x day, hoping that he will reply asking to do something on that day- which is a day we both have free anyway and he knows this. But he never replied.

Fast forward to today. Since he’s at work, instead of calling him, I texted asking if he had a few minutes during his lunch hour to call me. I did this because I’m aware that our custodial arrangements likely won’t allow a phone conversation until after the weekend. 4 hours pass and I hear absolutely nothing. No phone call, not even a text. Does 6 months together not warrant that type of conversation given it’s been a relatively short amount of time? I just wanted to ask him where we stand, if he wants me to leave him alone just to tell me. I would never just disappear on anyone. He’s a 36 year old man with children so I didn’t expect him to do this.

I wonder if it’s safe to assume this relationship is over without being mentioned. And I wonder if he’s just avoiding and feeling pressured so he is ignoring me and perhaps will be in touch sooner or later. Or being a coward and ghosting me altogether? Thoughts?

Tl;dr: Bf has been distant. I told him how I felt yesterday over text. The cut the conversation short and I reached out earlier to have a conversation and he has ignored that. Does it sound like he’s ghosting?

&amp;#x200B;

A few nights ago, I did something he's repeatedly asked me not to do (put a pinch of tobacco in one corner of the bowl of our bong. I like it that way, he doesn't).

&amp;#x200B;

He saw and started up immediately, saying nobody in his life listens to him and I'm a liar. Fair. I did say I wouldn't do this. And I did it. But I reached out to pause the TV since we're watching a show and I know we'll both regret letting it run later when we forget where we left off. When I got the remote in my hand off the tray on the couch, he grabbed the center of my forearm. He still claims he was aiming for the remote but 1- so what, it would still be bad to grab the remote from me and 2- he's an adult wearing glasses and sitting two feet from me, so wherever he's aiming, he should be able to get.

&amp;#x200B;

The ensuing argument gave me a panic attack - I stood in the kitchen dissociating for a few minutes then went to the bedroom to get my meds. He got angry that I passed by him ""shivering like a holocaust victim"" and said my panic attacks are ""a royal get out of jail free card that make me untouchable and absolve my actions"".

&amp;#x200B;

He didn't apologize for grabbing me for half an hour or so into the fight, and didn't stop yelling until I was curled up crying. He also believed that my yelling at him to leave me alone was the same as me calling the police and telling them he assaulted me, that the neighbors were dialing right now, and he was getting out of here. He put on his coat and shoes, grabbed his keys, but ended up taking them off and sitting on the floor with me eventually asking me why I lied and saying that's what got him so upset.

&amp;#x200B;

We kept going back and forth another hour or so, I don't remember how we finished but he admitted that he never should have grabbed me even though it was an accident and that he couldn't explain why but that he would never hit me. (My therapist thinks he'd hit me in the moment one day if he doesn't get help)

&amp;#x200B;

How can I talk to him about this without drawing more ire? He was doing better when he was briefly in therapy but then the doctor literally ghosted him.

Me and my boyfriend of 4,5 years broke up on the 5th of this month. We were in a long distance relationship with a 9 hour time difference. The relationship started in 2014, but the long distance started in July 2018. He’s coming home in April (2019).

We broke it off because he was a really bad long distance boyfriend. We only talked one hour on the phone once a week if I was lucky. During the winter holidays he didn’t call me for 3 weeks, even though he had told me he would have more time than usual to talk then. 

As I said, he’s coming home this April. But some weeks before the break up, he told me that he wanted to either move back abroad to work, or move to a city 3 hours away from me. I couldn’t take it. The though of a continued LDR (long distance relationship) without an end date killed me. We tried to talk it out, because neither of us wanted to end it. There was a lot of crying from both of us. He wasn’t very cooperative. Neither of us was happy with how the relationship was, and I told him (as many many times before) what I would need to “survive” another LDR. He told me that “Sure I can try, but don’t expect me to be able to talk/text more”. I asked him what he wanted/needed from me, and he just said “I don’t know”. He’s always been a really bad communicator, even when we lived in the same city. He’s not very good with conflict, he closes himself off and doesn’t really want to talk about it. That attitude can work in a regular relationship, it can still work out, but not in a LDR....

The question:
We broke it off because the circumstances wasn’t working for us. But I miss him so dearly. It’s been 3 weeks with the only contact being me congratulating him on his graduation (the very thing he moved away to do. He answered “Thank you, it means a lot!” And nothing more). 

I cry almost every day, and I just want him back. Not the LDR relationship him that never put me first, the him that left me last summer to pursue his dreams. 

I feel like shit, but it hasn’t been a very long time since the breakup, how will I know if I’ll grow to regret this decision? Should I reach out to him to try again when he gets home? Even if that possibly means starting a LDR again?

So my husband and I live together and have been together a few years. The past year or so, sex has been awful (it was great before). He usually can't get off, goes soft every few minutes, etc. He also doesn't seem to enjoy it. There wasn't any issue before this. He's also stopped initiating and has started turning me down. My first thought was it was something medical, but it's been confirmed not to be. Now, he's got multiple terabytes of porn stashed on his PC with all different types of fetishes. Some fetishes are things that aren't even possible. I've never had an issue with this, but catching someone masterbating a couple times a day when you are feeling sex (and intimacy) starved, really sucks. And as it turns out, he's masturbating 3 times a day. Sometimes these sessions last an hour or more. He maintains that he is still physically attracted to me (and my body hasn't changed during this at all) but he's often choosing porn and his hand over me. I'm beginning to feel like there's not really a relationship because there's zero intimacy at this point. Heck, I can't even get him to go out and do fun stuff with me on the weekends. I've talked with him a few times, asking how I can make sex better for him or what I can do in general, but the conversations never go anywhere. He's even acknowledged that porn and excessive masterbation is causes issues when it comes to real sex, and then he'll tell me he's stopped but the next day I will walk in and theirs porn playing. At this point it's seriously affecting his sleep as well because he will wake up an hour early for session 1 (at 3am), and then try and stay up later than me (until about 11pm when I go to bed as my work schedule is delayed). He does his best to hide it every time I walk in the room. I'd say 70% of the time I walk in the living room he's going at it. I feel like I'm not even allowed out there anymore.

Its gotten to the point where he’s had to turn down a very well paying gig because he’s so burnt out. He’s also losing weight at an alarming pace, from 175 to 159 in just 3 months, while trying to GAIN weight. He’s just started therapy and is going to an internist soon. I know he’s doing everything he can think of to try and improve his health. 

Up until recently, I was in good health and my own mental illness was being treated semi-successfully with medication and EMDR/somatic psychotherapy. I have PTSD from an accident, and I’m in the process of being diagnosed with some sort of autoimmune illness, which has been getting progressively worse. I used to be in a place where I could help my SO with his stress, but I just can’t anymore. My doctors have told me that unless I seriously start managing and decreasing my stress levels, I will continue to decline in health. 

So I wold love some ideas on how I can be supportive of him while not increasing my stress levels at all. At the moment, I do the majority of the domestic duties in our apartment. He’s gotten better about not giving me a shitty attitude when I ask him for help cleaning, but I still can’t handle taking care of both of us. I do all of the cooking as well, which is getting more and more challenging because of how hard it is for me to do so much cleaning. I have chronic pain, so doing things like carrying laundry or taking the trash to the dumpster are really hard for me. I’ve been taking my laundry to my car and driving it to the laundry room in our apartment complex because I can’t manage to carry it all the way there and back anymore. (Which is emotionally devastating because I work in the fitness industry, and I’m currently incapable of exercising to the degree that I would like to). 

Because of the autoimmune issue, I have to eat in a very specific way, and everything has to be cooked at home. I can’t manage the amount of cleaning that cooking for two people creates. I ended up pushing myself too far, and now I have to take time off of work, too. I’ve been in treatment for my issues for three years, and I’m constantly trying to find new methods and modalities of managing my issues. Which ends up being very expensive. Which leads me to my next point: we live in one of the most expensive cities in the world. I hate living here, and I would move in a heartbeat if he didn’t HAVE to work here.

After the end of this relationship I struggled for about 1 year with threats, isolation, people turned against me by this person, internet bullying and whatnot.

I sort of got over it or learn to live with the memories and never really cared that much although I was left with a very low self-esteem.

I had a few other long term relationships in my life that were very normal and non confrontational, no drama, and I preferred it that way. I never really had too intense feelings in these relationships and even when I got dumped I didn't suffer that much.

I never really felt in love and I was just choosing my partners by judging how ""normal"" they are, and at the smallest sign of confrontation or fight I would just bail without any remorse.

Recently I met somebody and I really fell in love this time, and all my judging about what's ""normal"" went out the window. Now we are in a relationship and I couldn't be happier but sometimes we fight, and instead of being rational and resolving the issues, every time an issue is addressed I just can't help but reminding myself how worthless I am, all the memories from 10 years ago come back to me and the abusive words of that person ring in my head and i just sink into this pit of self pity and self harm, which doesn't solve anything. It just dismisses the reason of the fight (which usually is not even a big deal) and everything becomes about me being a piece of shit that doesn't deserve to live. And it is a vicious circle because as my partner tries to reassure me that everything is okay I become guilty about acting like this and feel even more shitty.

So far I've supported her through three. She has an awful saviour complex she is having trouble getting rid of.

She started dating Matthew in July of 2018. At first things seemed pretty good, but the red flags came when his ex girlfriend made a call-out post on Instagram about him physically abusing her. I tried to warn Veronica that abusers don't often change but she wouldn't have it. 

Veronica and I were living with my boyfriend at the time and when things fell through with me and him we were forced to find a place to live fairly quickly, and through a variety of circumstances we could only really find a place to live if Matthew lived with us as well. We all moved in together in October 2018.

Things were going fairly well at first, but Matthew has a seasonal job and winter is his off season, and Veronica is unemployed. They started spending every waking moment together which I warned them was probably not very healthy. They are both also alcoholics. 

The fights started to get very bad a couple months ago. Now at least once a week I wake up to them black out drunk and screaming at each other. Matthew has the tendency to throw things around, so there's a lot of banging. They fight about a lot of things, mainly him cheating on her. Recently he has started to become more physical with her. Throwing drinks on her and pushing her. 

Last night I woke up to Veronica screaming my name to help her. He ripped all of her posters of their wall and was stepping her on legs. This morning she's walking around with a limp. This is all very traumatic and triggering to me as well since I used to be in a physically abusive relationship. She is determined not to break up with him because according to her he has had multiple concussions in his life, thus resulting in some kind of personality disorder in which he has no control over his actions when he drinks. Supposedly they are both going to quit drinking, but it has been said before.

I'm really at a loss for what to do. Our lease was signed until October 2019, and I don't really have the money to move out anyways. I don't feel comfortable getting the police involved.

t2_3hz92itz,1553812298.0,b6pcgc,t3_b6pcgc,7,"First, I would just like to preface this post by saying that it is very possible that some of the things that I'm mentioning might not be a big deal, but due to growing up in an abusive home I sometimes have trouble knowing what's normal and what's not, and when I'm expecting too much or what's a normal expectation. Feel free to let me know if anything I'm saying is unreasonable, just please be aware that I'm not acting entitled or demanding. I posted here so I have a neutral opinion, because sometimes I just can't tell.

My husband and I have been married for 5 years, together for 7. Lately I feel like he doesn't make much effort in terms of planning out dates or fun things for us to do. He's always up for doing anything I suggest, but I'm always the one taking initiative to do things.

He also doesn't really try to do unexpected nice things anymore, while he used to (sending me flowers to work when I had a bad day, surprising me with my favorite cookies which you can only get in a few places, etc.).

However, for the past few months I knew he had been making a list of birthday gifts for me. We would be out and I would see something I liked or I would mention something related to my hobby that I wanted to try doing but that required a specific tool and he would make a note on his phone and wink at me. I was pretty excited, not because of the gifts themselves (they're not expensive things or things I wouldn't be able to get myself) but I was just happy that he seemed to be making an effort to do something nice and paying attention.

Last night during dinner, we were talking about my birthday coming up and he said ""so, since we are going to \[restaurant\] for your birthday I just got you one little thing."" My heart dropped a little bit. Not because I was expecting a ton of gifts necessarily, but basically he is using the fact that we're going to this one restaurant (which I was the one that planned and booked, and that required some coordination to get a reservation) as the reason why he's only getting me this one thing, which he said himself is a very small thing, when he's been hinting for months at the tons of gift ideas he had for me.

One thing to clarify here: while the restaurant we're going to is a nice restaurant is not anything outside of the normal for us, the only reason why it's special is that it's hard to get a reservation and I've been wanting to go there for a while. Another thing I'd like to clarify is that I'm not disappointed about the lack of gifts exactly, we do well financially and can get the things we want. Plus the couple of things that I know are in his list are not expensive. The reason why I'm so disappointed is that the gifts were the only show of effort that I was expecting from him, and now I heard from him directly that he only got this one small thing. I was really excited to see what else he came up with.

If I was expecting him to do anything (make me breakfast, plan a fun date) else I wouldn't care about the gifts but he hasn't done anything like that for a while. In the past for birthdays or anniversaries we have sometimes agreed to do no gifts and to just plan a fun date or outing or something, and I thought that was great, but that hasn't happened in a while, and when it does it's always coming from me.

Am I being unreasonable?

Should I talk to him about this? I feel like I should but I don't know the best way to do it. On one hand I feel like I should just talk to him now but I feel like maybe it's a bit silly and that I'm just getting myself worked up, when I don't know what he got me or if he's doing anything else (but I'm very much expecting that he didn't) or if I should wait until my actual birthday but then I'm expecting that I'll just end up disappointed and be really upset when it's my actual birthday and ruin the dinner I've been looking forward to for months.

TL;DR My husband hasn't really made any effort to do nice things or plan dates in a while. I thought he was going to make more of an effort for my birthday but it appears that he's not.",relationships,I (31F) feel like my husband (30M) doesn't really try anymore and my birthday is coming up
t2_tkgkv79,1553810767.0,b6p1lr,t3_b6p1lr,9,"I started working full-time at a new job a few months ago.  I really like this job because it makes things easier for my severe mental health issues.  (I have severe general and social anxiety, and depression, and this job allows me to have mostly only very highly structured social interaction with coworkers and customers.  It's also mostly minor physical labor, which means my mental and emotional energy (which is already pretty low due to the depression) aren't so drained at the end of the day that I can't do something fun or productive with my off-time.)

&amp;#x200B;

After a couple weeks I noticed a coworker of mine in another department who I find incredibly attractive and who is generally very much my type aesthetically. I don't generally find coworker relationships a good idea for reasons very similar to the problem I'm having now.  I worked at a different location of this company previously, but there were very few people my age who worked the same shift as me, so I never thought that this could be a problem when I started working at my new store, but obviously I should have guessed because it's a more normal shift in a much larger city.

&amp;#x200B;

There wasn't really any reason for us to directly interact/opportunities for casual socializing, as we are on different teams, and as I said, I see coworker dating as somewhat of a risky enterprise, so I decided it would be better to let this crush die out.  Unfortunately, rather than dying down, it instead got way bigger and our two departments/teams started socializing a bit more at work recently, so I ended up seeing a lot more of her, although we didn't really interact more directly.

&amp;#x200B;

I know you're all going to tell me I should have known this was a bad idea, and I did, but I was really into this person, and I have bad impulse control due to my mental illness.  So I deserve/accept any criticism.  I figured I'd try actively socializing with this person to see if there was even hope of something happening.  But literally the first time I tried to her to them outside of a clear work context they immediately shut me down.  It was kinda brutal, although I can't speak for whether she intended it that way, because I basically tried to say hi, and she passive-aggressively blew me off and we haven't interacted since.  I considered asking some of our coworkers if they knew why she was so stand-offish, because I've never seen her be anything other than polite or friendly to other coworkers or customers, but given her behavior I didn't want to make it seem like I was gossiping/ignoring her boundaries.

My original conclusion was that, given how obvious and unsubtle I am when trying to hide interest in somebody, she probably knew I liked her and didn't want to give me any false hope that would leave me annoying her for the next several months until I finally took the hint that she wasn't interested.

&amp;#x200B;

But as many people do, I've let my interest build up far beyond where it should have, and while I have reasons/excuses for that, I know it's not healthy.  That said, now that it's gotten there, even though I think she's made it clear she's very much not interested, I have a really hard time getting her out of my head and not noticing her when I see her at work.  Like, if I'm working in an area near her department, I often can't help but look over to see if she's there.

Since we work the same five days as each other on roughly the same shift, we also usually end up in the break room for lunch and breaks at the same times, and it's a small, open area.  Every time I see her, it adds to/reinforces my crush, even though I don't want it to.  When I try very hard, I can manage to avoid running into her for most of the day, but obviously that still involves actively thinking about her, and when by random but not unlikely chance I can't manage to completely avoid her, I lose pretty much any progress I've made in moving past my feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

She pretty much never visually registers my presence at all, unless we happen to accidentally lock eyes in a moment of me being weak and glancing at her across the salesfloor/breakroom, and none of our mutual friends/coworkers has ever mentioned the issue, so I guess it's possible I'm worrying over nothing as far as the bothering her part.  I know sometimes I think other people are more aware of my behavior/feelings than they really are because of my obvious emotional investment/mental health issues.

So the two questions I'd like some advice on are how, given our work situation, I can do things to help me get past this crush on her, and also what I can do to avoid potentially making her uncomfortable with my behavior until I do get past it.  I don't have any hard feelings over her not being interested, and I know some other male coworkers have made moves on/hit on her, so I would feel really bad if I made her time at work less fun than it already is given we're working shitty retail jobs.

And obviously for my own peace of mind, I would like to not be so uncomfortable at work.  Prior to this whole crush thing, I was really not not enjoying working here, and I think it would be hard for me to find another job that would be as tolerable given my mental health issues.  I've previously had work crushes that resolved themselves much more simply and quickly than this, and I was not prepared for this one to get so annoying go on for so long.  If it weren't for that, I would feel kinda silly posting here about it, but I'm out of ideas for how to deal with it.  


**Edit: I mention the mental illness because in my experience it amplifies the standard problems that** ***everyone*** **has with getting over crushes, and not because I think it makes any bad behavior on my part more acceptable.**

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:  I have an unrequited crush on a female coworker and I'm having trouble getting over it.  We are scheduled on all the same days, and have similar breaks/meals, so I can't really just avoid her until it goes away.

-The pipework has to be copper or stainlessteel or copper nickel. 

-The pipework has to be 3/8"" diameter

-There has to have a leak detector installed like Aldos 10mm

Ground is frozen and there is no where for water to go. Heavy rain expected soon, so I thought I could rig this up to run water far away from the foundation, otherwise my grading is messed up and excess water will run into a basement window well and flood.

I thought that as long as the water level in my barrel is higher than the end position of my hose, that gravity would be sufficient to generate enough water pressure to move the water through the hose??? With this current set up my barrel just overflows from the top with zero water coming from the end of the hose.

Some points to consider:

* It is not practical for me to raise the barrel off the ground, I can maybe get an extra foot of elevation under it if more pressure is needed
* The valve is open and the hose is not obstructed
* No point of the hose is ever close to being higher than the water level in the barrel as it runs towards the back of my yard
* the seal between the valve and the barrel drips ever so slightly but I wouldn't think this would drop pressure significantly?
* Do I need a wider hose? Shorter Hose?
* What if I placed a new valve higher up on the barrel such that the valve and subsequent water level was always higher than the highest point of my hose?

Why is this current set up not working? What am I missing?

Any help greatly appreciated!

I’m currently converting a single brick, detached garage into a studio for sound editing &amp;mixing.
The room is approx 3mx6m with 2.7m height.
I have ordered 2 windows and a sliding door that have an Rw value of 40 (which roughly converts to about 43 STC)
I’ve heard that for the walls, you should try and aim for a target 5 STC units higher than your windows/doors, which would be approx 47 STC 

Ive built a stud wall over the brick and will line it with regular fibreglass. So I’m wondering what plasterboard I need, would 1 sheet of 13mm be enough to hit the desired STC rating? Another option would be to have double sheeted 13mm with green glue in between, but not sure if that’s overkill for my needs.

Also, the roof will be a hipped roof layed with terracotta roof tiles and insulation. I’ll be plastering the internal ceiling along with some exposed rafters. Would I just match the ceiling plasterboard thickness with the walls?

Here’s some extra info about the project:
The garage is in a very quiet residential area, around 40 dB SPL. I won’t need to record in the room, so don’t need to hit  ultra STC targets.
Looking to suppress airborne noise only as the garage is detached from the house.

Plasterboard will be attached directly to stud wall, not floating.

My husband and I decided to replace a couple hardwood floors in our home.

Problem is the flooring we got is thicker than the original. This wouldn't normally be a problem, if it weren't for our baseboard vents, pictured below.

[https://imgur.com/bfMWUwh](https://imgur.com/bfMWUwh)

https://i.redd.it/ewibx1tweql21.jpg

Unfortunately we didn't notice this issue until we were ready to install the new flooring.

As you can see, the old, thinner, flooring was able to just rest under the bottom edge of the vent, but the new flooring is about twice as thick as the old, so it comes up over the vent.Here's another photo to provide a close up of what I'm talking about.

[https://imgur.com/yxpJ52A](https://imgur.com/yxpJ52A)

https://i.redd.it/hh33b6hgfql21.jpg

Raising the vents isn't really an option. Our home was build back in 1892, and the walls are still the original plaster (I suspect possibly in poor condition in the room in question due to what we've been able to catch a peek of from behind the paneling, but good everywhere else) and cutting out a hole above our baseboard and adding ductwork to raise the vents is going to be slightly too ambitious for what we can afford to do time and money wise at the moment.

Not to mention it might mean also having to replace all the baseboards as they'd then have giant holes in them, and we're quite fond of the all the old woodwork in the house.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm concerned about the expansion gap. We obviously can't just leave a gap between the flooring and the vents. In addition to that just being dumb, it would create a dust trap.

Along the rest of the baseboard the gap will be hidden with quarter round, but I feel like we cant just board over the vent with quarter round either. What if we needed to remove the vents for any reason? (cleaning, etc.) We'd need to tear off the quarter round to get to them. (However, if this is the only answer, please let me know.)

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose another option could be to just forgo the expansion gap around the vents, as they might still be easy enough to remove if needed with just the flooring over a bit of the bottom with no quarter round on top. However, I'm not sure if this would be a correct solution or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Another, though smaller, problem, is our entrance door.

[https://imgur.com/N41J74G](https://imgur.com/N41J74G)

https://i.redd.it/0959ewycjql21.jpg

Like the vents, the old flooring seems to have just slid under that board below the weather strip, and obviously the new flooring cannot.

Would it be better to pull up the weather strip, lay the floor, then replace weather strip over the flooring with a thinner wooden board underneath?

Or should we just lay the flooring with the expansion gap and perhaps throw down some molding to cover? (The door would still open, but I'm concerned about tripping risks and to be honest I'm also concern it might just look stupid.)

&amp;#x200B;

I've googled around and searched this sub for answers but found nothing that could really help our problem. Could someone help me determine the best solution? Any help at all is appreciated. Thank you in advance!

**Backstory:**We replaced all the flooring in the house with engineered hardwoods. We used a contractor from lumber liquidators. Overall, we've been very pleased with the work.

However, there was a huge issue with our AC unit where the condensation pan was draining into an open pvc pipe. The pvc pipe clogged/got full, and the water overflowed the top of the pvc pipe and just leaked into the wall. The leak was behind our laundry machine, so at first when we saw water coming up between the wood, we brought in a plumber to take a look. He couldn't find anything, and chalked it up to the washer hose not draining properly. Replaced it, charged us parts, went on his way.

It wasn't till much later when the problem got worse that we went into the AC and found the real issue. It's been about a year now and we have not had any excess water, but the flooring in that area has been completely destroyed. Warped to the point of popping out entirely, subflooring (underlayment?) displayed and everything.

**TLDR:** Leak messed up my floor real good. Leak definitely fixed, but need to replace flooring.

My wife and I want to DIY some new tiling in the area, as it is our mudroom/laundry anyway. 

The space is almost exactly 5'x12'.

My real questions are:

1. We've never tiled before. Is this something we can tackle? An area slightly larger than a bathroom that's rectangular and empty? I've done my research and I think yes, but my wife is particular and picky so...
2. The big one: What do I do about the transition? (See picture above) Currently, it's a seamless go between the area we are looking at tiling and the kitchen. Can I just get a jigsaw right there at the ""seam"" at the door casing, add tile, then a t-mold?

There is a stack to the left of the sink. It currently drains the kitchen sink on the first floor and vents through the garage roof. If I run 7 feet of pipe following the wall, I would need to connect to the drain where the cleanout is. Can I install a tee fitting on the bottom of the stack and the cleanout just above it? I think I could make the vent connection in the garage attic, so I should be able to tee off the drain pipe just before the stack and run it up parallel to the stack to make the connection in the attic. Does this sound correct or do you have a better way of doing it?

Is it possible to put material into the holes that would harden enough to screw into safely? Otherwise what would be another option? Seems like the material is drywall with something else behind it! So wondering if cutting out a large piece of drywall and then putting a new square in the hole I cut could work.

I had confided in his mother when I found out and told her - eventually it led to me talking about my OWN mother to which I disclosed that my mom and I have no relationship, she was very verbally/emotionally abusive to me as a child and now that I am in my adult years I have chosen to not have my mom very involved in my life.
She knows that I am pregnant but that’s pretty much it.
My boyfriend doesn’t live in the same state I do at the moment and I refuse to tell her where he lives for safety reasons and my own sanity. 
I basically told my boyfriends mother that I don’t wish to have a relationship with my mother and etc etc..

Well today, come find out that my boyfriends mom has MY mom added on Facebook and has been messaging her?????
Funny thing is I have my mom blocked off my social media and I do not even have my own little sister on my Facebook (mostly bc she’s never on and doesn’t use it hardly) so that means my boyfriends mom had to look up my sister - go through her friends list - dig through her profile - find my mom via last name - add her.
It angers me SOOOO much that she would even do that behind my back?! Because for 1 - now she knows the general area of where my boyfriend lives and when I decide to move - I want to do so without my mom harassing me. (Which she has done in the past!)

I once moved to Oregon and didn’t tell her where I was moving because I wanted peace and quiet and I made the mistake of telling her my address once because she said she wanted to send me a birthday gift and fast forward a week later she was pissed off I didn’t want to send her money so she called the local police there and basically told them that I ‘robbed’ her before moving and she would like for them to go to my house and search the place for ‘her things’.
It was a LONG process and exhausting and stressful for me.
Obviously the cops ended up doing nothing but just going though trying to find receipts for year old things I have bought and just trying to prove everything Was mine was just stress I DIDNT NEED.
And this has happened MULTIPLE times..
My mom plays nice - I feel bad and want to tell her things bc she is my mother and when she gets mad at me she just tries to use it to her advantage.
So I’ve learned it’s just best to only tell her small details that I don’t mind her knowing but nothing about my personal life. 


Fast forward to now - my plan was to move to the boyfriend before baby is due and not tell my mom so I could just focus on my new family and live stress free
And with my boyfriends mom adding my mom and messaging her behind my back - my mom now knows where my boyfriend lives which could cause MAJOR issues for me if I want to move forward with my life.

I just think it’s so wrong and such an invasion of MY privacy - after I tell my boyfriends mom that my mom and I do NOT talk and she decides to hunt her down via FB and add her / message her.

That is basically like if I said I was adopted and didn’t know my real mother and she went and tracked her down to message her and tell her things about my life.

I think my boyfriends mom crossed a HUGE line and I am SOOOO mad!!
However I don’t know if I’m overreacting from pregnant hormones or if I have every right to be upset.
I have finally gotten to a point in my life right now where I am happy and stress free without having to deal with my mother and especially after telling the BF’s mom that I’m not close with mine and she doesn’t know much about my current life - WHY would she track her down and add/message her??

I want to tell the boyfriends mom she is way out of line for doing that and basically compromised my safety and sanity by doing that behind my back but not sure how to tell her.
My boyfriend is a huge mamas boy and won’t tell his mom she crossed a line even though he agrees with me.
I love and respect my boyfriend enough to not cuss his mom out, but I am soooo angry and unsure of what to even say to her at this point without flipping my shit on her.

Did she cross a line??? Or maybe I am over reacting..??
Like I said, it just infuriates me that my mom now knows things I chose not to tell her for my own safety and sanity. If she starts messing my life up, it effects my boyfriend and that’s not fair to him. 


***TLDR*** I have no relationship with my mother and now being an adult I choose not to have her in my life or know things going on in my life for my own sanity and safety. My boyfriends mom knows all of this after I specifically told her I do not want my mom knowing parts of my life because things that have happened in the past and she tracks her down somehow via FB to add her and message her without even telling me and now my mom knows certain details about my life NOW that could really compromise my sanity and ruin my relationship.

He’s done this off and on the entire time.   I know when’s he’s watching it a lot because he has sex with me less.  Sometimes he’ll still have tons of sex with me but won’t cum.  That’s fine but after enough times of that, sex starts to suck and all I can think about is how I might as well not even enjoy myself because any second now he will stop and exhaustingly say he can’t do this and then rolls over.  It sucks when you’re feeling amazing and then out of nowhere he stops and just.....rolls over.   

It seems like he can’t stop. He goes back to looking at naked woman constantly on all of his social media apps and porn. He scrolls through naked pics of women like it’s all he can think about.   Then I get even more annoyed because he acts like he doesn’t understand why sex isn’t getting him off when he knows it’s because of he can’t stop jacking off. He has told me it’s a problem.

If this was an every now and then thing then I wouldn’t care at all.   I might get a couple good weeks out of him and then for at least a good month or two he’s back to all these damn women that he can’t even physically touch.

tl;dr: gf of 4 years have an affair, unsure who she likes more, pretty much leave me no other choice than break-up. She hurt me and scared to be alone and generally don't know how to cope.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is short description about us. We met 4 years ago on her 18. It was never supposed to be LTR, but we immediately fall in love, our personalities seemed like a perfect match. We had a great time together regardless of the age gap. Her family loves me and if we break up I will miss them very much. I always tried to be caring, sensitive guy and I don't want to buy in to ""girls only like douches"" mentality, though right now my feeling are all over the place. I helped her go through depression, took her to doctors, help her to pay for school, I am cooking (she never leave house without lunch in the box), found us an apartment in bigger city co we can have decent jobs.... I don't want to stack favors, it's just my point that I was trying to be a good partner.

Few days ago when confronted she admitted she have an affair. There was some clues, she stopped picking phone at random times, sometimes get late without explanation and so on. It is taking two months now and she even spend a weekend there, while lying she went to visit parent in another town.

She is making 50 percent of people I truly care about. Other than that, I just have my best friend. It's not that I am hideous or socially impaired. I am just introvert with somewhat time consuming hobby and I was happy that way. So dumping her will be very hurtful for me, because I might end quite alone and it scares me. She is not wiling to ditch her affair, though if that was the case I might consider forgiving her and try to work on repairing the damage. But since she is unable to at least give me pinky promise she will end it, I don't see anything else I can do then break-up.

Guy she is seeing is like 20 years older, have family and kids. So after she leave I am almost certain her affair will eventually fall apart. Which makes me double sad, because I do care about her and I think this will be lesson about regret.

We are living together, so after we say that we are done, we will remain at least for a while roommates. I have no idea how to deal with that.

Anyway, sorry it's little messy. I don't know how to make sense in any of this. I am quite down from it, it was 4 years of perfection, so I thought this might be the last relationship.

t2_3hx44itw,1553787774.0,b6kczy,t3_b6kczy,4,"My parents are scientists who live only for science. My not becoming a scientist was a real let-down for them. By way of background, my mother was born and raised in Switzerland and earned her PhD there in physiology. My father was raised in Germany and earned his PhD in genetics. My parents met during a post-doc in Europe and moved to the US to take-up jobs at a university. We grew up very comfortable in NYC and enjoyed a really great quality of life. My parent’s marriage is one of intellect. They love and respect each other, but are passionate about their intellectual pursuits more than anything else. That always came first and they supported one another in that endeavor. They never learned to “shut it off” as it were and so their marriage is very odd. They prioritize work over spending time together and only ever talk about committees, teaching assignments and preliminary findings. They have no common topics outside of that. They’re still teaching and conducting research and will do so to the day they die. There is no retirement for them. 

My siblings are all high achievers. My oldest sister earned a PhD in physics and married a professor and they live in the Midwest. My brother went to medical school and works in a pediatric intensive care unit. I have an associate’s degree and work in sales. I just never found my passions led me to academia – I love to camp and take road trips and do other things, but school was not my thing. My sister’s husband is an academic and my brother’s wife was an oncology nurse who stayed home full time to care for children. I model my relationships most on my brother. He and his wife are not only husband and wife, but best friends. They have things beyond professional achievements and have a life together. They can talk and gossip and his wife can call him on his BS. That’s who I model a lot of my ideas on as my parents aren’t a great template. My sister’s marriage is exactly like my parents. While my sister and parents are nice, they only interact with people like them – people with PhDs or people who are on that pathway. They deal almost exclusively with ultra-high achieving people. My brother is somewhat different I think because he deals with the public. He’s a lot more open and accepting and understands that not everyone is fascinated by T cells or quarks. My brother had dinner with us (me and the BF) and it was a lot easier/smoother than I had thought. My brother treated us to a nice place and we followed that up with a BBQ at his house where my BF and brother learned to use a smoker my brother just got. 

My boyfriend is an executive assistant and does a great job, is kind, sweet and charming. Like me, school isn’t his thing and we share so many interests outside of school. I’ve met his family and they’re wonderful. I’ve been putting off introducing him to the rest of my family for almost a year now. My parents and sister are hurt that I would introduce the BF to my brother and not them when I’ve had so many opportunities to. I told my SIL about my concerns and she chuckled as she felt so awkward meeting my parents the first time. My brother’s advice is to just jump in with both feet. I’m not so sure. 

I’ve told my family very little about BF. I’ve told BF a bit about them. I’m wondering if I need to meet my parents and tell them about him and be very clear about how to talk to him. They have this very frank, very Germanic way of saying things that can be a bit too direct. I’m worried they’ll insult him because they say something without thinking. I grew up feeling dumb and less-than because they were always worried about me because I didn’t do well in science. I was even tested for learning disabilities and emotional problems because I was an average C+/B- student. BF is the same way. We’re happy people who aren’t dumb, but my parents really, very seriously, don’t understand that. Their will includes extra provisions for me to “help me” because of my different abilities compared to my other siblings. 

tl;dr In their own weird and awkward way, they love me and want the best for me. They want to be a part of my life, but they have a way about them that is incredibly blunt and can be hurtful.

I just found out my bf (M20) actually did have sex with this girl the first time we broke up a few months ago. About 2-3 weeks after we were broken up. After we made up, he told me they hung out while we were broken up and promised me nothing happened when I asked. The thing is we had breakup sex 2 weeks into the breakup. So he did it with this girl days after we had sex. 

After we had sex, we had a fight the next day, so things seemed done for good. But STILL. He was still heartbroken, as was I. It was still fresh. It was as if he did it with her days after we broke up.

We broke up a few months after this first break up (I still didn’t know about what he did) and got back together again, and now we’re still together. He knows I’ve always been jealous of this girl cuz they had a “thing” a few years back (I think it was a sexual relationship mostly) and stayed friends, and she cheats on her boyfriend with a ton of people. The only times he likes her pictures is when we are broken up. On top of that, he replied to an Instagram story of hers days after our second breakup. 

The reason I didn’t know until now is because I just went on his phone for the first time in a long time, just because I was curious to see if he was talking to anyone while we were broken up. When I confronted him about it he told me he wanted to leave it in the past and not hurt me. He said he was really sorry.

Now it’s like I can’t stop thinking about him touching another woman other than me. Or him being turned on by this girl, because unfortunately the text to his friend he told about it had details like his playing with her butt and other things. I’m just upset about so much and I don’t know what to do, because I want to be with him and I know he would never cheat on me. I know he wouldn’t have sex with her again anyways because he expressed to his friend how sketched out he was since she kept saying no after she’d allow him to do things.

I’m just mostly hurt that it happened between them,  and that it was days after he did it with me. I know he loves me so much and find me attractive but it’s just shitty. He says it was because he was trying to get me off of his mind but I don’t care. 

TL;DR- My boyfriend and I had two breakups, and I just found out that he had sex with someone during our first breakup. And even though it was during a time where we thought it was over for good, it was days after he and I had breakup sex. I know he loves me and finds me very attractive, and would never see her as relationship material, it still sucks that it happened.

t2_e9ixh,1553808669.0,b6omrh,t3_b6omrh,1,"A bit of background: I've been single for about two years now, after having a bad breakup with my ex that left me emotionally unavailable to every woman that came into my life since. A few months ago, I met this girl and now we've been dating for about four months. After going out and meeting/dating tons of women, she's the first person I've felt anything for since my ex and has opened me back up to caring about someone again, and being open to a serious relationship again. It feels humanizing and great. However, a few months prior, she ended her relationship of a few years and currently is in the frame of mind that I've been in for the last two years...

We've been open and communicated well and she says that she has feelings for me but isn't ready for anything serious. While that's hard to hear, I get it and respect her boundaries by keeping things causal with her like she wants, rather than trying to force her into anything (love in a way that makes them feel free). While I can deal with this and still see other women (none of which have remotely captivated me like this girl), the main issue here is that she travels for work...

Not only am I developing intense feelings for someone who says she has feelings for me back, but her job makes me feel like shit, despite me getting a new job that a month ago  I was ecstatic for at the time. Between her social media posts, and our conversations when we do hang out on weekends, I can't help but feel immense jealousy towards her life, and I know I shouldn't. She gets to travel to all these cool places, try new things and have all these amazing experiences, all while getting paid for it (possibly more than I'm getting paid), while I'm clocking into the same building, doing the same job day in and day out. I know she's just excited to tell me about her week, and not actually trying to 1up me, and I try to be centered and calm, but deep down it's killing me inside. (She's also mentioned that she's getting tired of the traveling and wants another position that'll have her stay in the area.)

I've never had this much fun with or had this level of intimacy with anyone before. It's been amazing! She's said that she's starting to warm up but also has made disqualifying comments like ""have fun on your dates while I'm away"" but will also call to tell me how much she misses me, or that she was on a date and couldn't stop thinking about me the whole time. Given that this girl is damn near everything I want in a woman, and the level of connection we have when were together, should I try to stick it out for when she stops travelling, or should I accept that things aren't lining up and cut her loose? (I don't want to give in to my insecurities and jealousy and cut things short when they could potentially work out in time). We live in a city, so I understand there's plenty of fish in the sea, however I haven't met anyone or seen anyone of her caliber, (according to what I look for in a woman) yet. (Not trying to put her on a pedistal, but it's true so far). I understand this is all coming from a place of weakness and insecurity and I'm trying to focus on my life and purpous, so any additional advice is welcomed.

t2_3hyjw8rh,1553807728.0,b6ofzo,t3_b6ofzo,7,"Hello! So, this one might be kind of long but I need to give sufficient background here because context is super important for this situation.

I've been working at this small company for about a year and a half now. By small, I mean 4 people that work in the office full time. We spend a lot of time together (9 hours/day) and we also go to work events together outside of that time occasionally (we work in the entertainment industry). Now, said bully coworker (lets call him G) has been at this company for six years. The coworker he's bullying (lets call her R) has been at this company for five and a half. They've both been here the longest out of everyone. The fourth coworker is 25M (lets call him M). He's been with the company for four years.

&amp;#x200B;

G is a very outgoing person. He comes off as friendly when he first meets people because he can be very polite and articulate. However, he is very opinionated and feels the need to loudly state those opinions whenever he can. This includes in the workplace. He also over exaggerates things often, (ie: he has stated to our boss things like ""If we don't get this new software we are going to be LIGHTYEARS behind everyone else. This software we're using is TERRIBLE and there's no point in doing our jobs anymore if we don't have the new one, honestly.""). Very dramatic, and most of the time when he says things like this they're not true. He's very into politics and likes to read articles and books and listen to podcasts (fine) but this seems to make him think that he's smarter than everyone else. Especially smarter than R. He also has the most seniority and therefore our boss gives him a lot of control. This contributes to his already gigantic ego. He has previously stated that he is the best there is at his job and couldn't possibly improve anymore (which I think is bullshit for anyone to say. There's always new things to learn). One of the most frustrating things he does (as someone who makes fun of people, even strangers on the street) is if R says anything remotely mean about another person he'll act all righteous all of a sudden and accuse her of being a bully or being mean. Which is exactly what he is 95% of the time. He is just awful to be around. His inflated sense of importance is just too much to handle sometimes. I could go on but I hope this suffices.

&amp;#x200B;

R is quite the opposite. She rarely states her opinion, opting to go with the flow of things more often than not. She is a pushover definitely and therefore an easy target. She is very sweet, and enjoys things like Disney and musicals (things which G hates). She is self conscious about her weight as she is a little chubby, and he will exploit that. She doesn't say anything negative ever to anyone except a few close friends and in our industry she has a reputation as being a nice and sweet person. She loves girly things, and recently got married so was very into telling us about her wedding planning (G doesn't believe in getting married and felt the need to state that each time she shared details about her wedding). She doesn't like conflict but G craves it and often causes it. She runs away from these situations.  She is very sensitive, to a fault. I do get frustrated with her sometimes because I want her to handle things and stand up for herself a little bit. She is just *too* nice.

&amp;#x200B;

M is friends with G and doesn't say much either way. He tries to stay away from the drama but, in my opinion, contributes by doing this. I'll explain:

&amp;#x200B;

So. Going back to when M started, the three of them really hit off. They became friends and hung out outside of work (by choice) all the time. Work events were fine and regular office hours were fine. Then, slowly R tells me, G started to pick on her. It started slow. M and G would hide behind corners and scare her in the office or make a joke about the way she said a word, or how she didn't catch the frisbee during lunch in the park. These kinds of things went on until I started a year and a half ago. Then things began to escalate.

&amp;#x200B;

When I started, they began a group WhatsApp chat in order to talk about me, mostly my progress and wether they would keep me on full time, etc. (important side note: Our boss makes these decisions but is half in retirement and relies on the word of us workers for most things. He ultimately just approves/disapproves things and thats it. Which is why G with most seniority gets away with a lot). Then slowly I gravitated towards R more because she was the only other female in the office. She invited me to her wedding shower, and staying over at her place, etc. Both G and M saw this and they began to hang out more without us. Instead of inviting R like they used to, once I came along, they started hanging out just the two of them. Then this group chat slowly morphed into G and M chatting back and forth on WhatsApp on their computers all day. Slowly this morphed into a guys vs. girls sort of situation. They talk, but not to us. Even though we often ask if they want to come for a walk on breaks or participate in work events with us, they don't return the favour. This has created a weird dynamic in the office where everyone cant be friends like they all were before, even when I started.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, G is openly mean to R. He has called her fat and said she is not good at her job and he refuses to help her get better (they do the same job and she started 6 months after him so he trained her). He said this in the WhatsApp chat to M, which R then saw open on his desktop at work. He has lectured her about ""slacking"" even though he often watches YouTube videos all day at his desk, and he is not the boss and it was not his place to lecture her about anything. Recently, we were all supposed to go to a work event together but M, R and I cancelled and G was so angry with R only. He called her selfish and mean. She did point out that everyone cancelled but he just said ""if you can't see how selfish you are then I'm done here"". He makes comments about how she is dumb and her friends outside of work are dumb. Her life decisions (getting married, getting a car, etc.) are all dumb too. He is just always singling her out. He thinks she is weak.

&amp;#x200B;

Their hatred for each other has grown to the point where they aren't friends any more, and being in the office can be unbearable at times with the tension between them. They never actually said they weren't friends so this tension comes from them acting normal but hating each other and never discussing it.

M doesn't help as he participates in this WhatsApp chat back and forth and I can hear them typing whenever R says something, and I know they're talking shit to each other. M doesn't directly bully R but doesn't stop G either or even try to get him to relax and think reasonably in anyway. G can really get himself all worked up about things and go off on R or anyone with a different opinion than him on anything and this makes the office environment terrible.

R went to our boss when she saw the WhatsApp chat on their screen originally, he moved her desk so they were separated in the office. That doesn't fix their relationship though. Our boss won't do much, but we have a union which R could go to. It just means she would really blow everything up at our office, and our boss may be angry as it would be going over his head.

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to report his behaviour anonymously to the union, which I really want to, then everything would blow up. G would probably be investigated and with only three other people in the office (one being his friend M) he would find out pretty quickly who did it. I'm just starting my career and I don't want to risk his backlash, but I feel strongly about this guy. He deserves to be taken down a notch at least. What he's doing isn't right, and the entertainment industry really is an incubator for bullies like this. It's difficult to report this type of thing if you want to keep your job.

I can only encourage R to do something so many times, but I can't *make* her do anything. Every day is worse as they have little spats here and there and never discuss issues. He just blows up sometimes followed by an awkward silence until he gets over it.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the best way to stop G from treating R like this (and acting like this in the workplace) without destroying our small company/ my own budding career with G's potential backlash? Is it even my place to deal with this if she is the victim and she doesn't want to do what I would do?

&amp;#x200B;

We started texting later on. I told him calling me names was not OK even in an argument. He said he was sorry if he upset me. I said thanks, yes I was upset because I thought we were good at not calling each other names and I was disappointed. I asked why we would want to date each other if he thought I was dumb (kind of a rhetorical question). Then he said he wasn't going to argue about this because he was too busy, which makes sense since he was at work.

However, it has been a whole day since and we haven't talked at all. The thing is, the final parts of this previous interaction made me feel like he was not genuinely apologizing and didn't regret calling me dumb. This had happened once before (him name calling). I had let him know I would not tolerate it but then let it go at the time because I thought our relationship would develop and this would not repeat. It is repeating.

I feel like unless I get a sincere apology/empathy and a dedication to act more civil and mature in the future (i.e. not resorting to calling me dumb in arguments), I will break up with him. Am I overreacting?

t2_10qe6y,1553807191.0,b6obyo,t3_b6obyo,1,"Let me start this by saying that my ex is an admirable person. He possesses integrity and a passion for both justice and those topics he is interested in. He has reasoned arguments for most of his beliefs. He randomly volunteers to help his friends with day long enterprises. He adopted a dog from a shelter and takes good care of her. These are the reasons why I became his friend and then his boyfriend. 


Becoming his boyfriend was in hindsight a mistake. I had never dated before and he lives a 6 hour drive / 2 hour flight from me, but he’s the first person I’ve felt so strongly for. Indeed, while we were dating I was basically obsessive about him. When he talked to me I was ecstatic. If he didn’t reply for half a day I was depressed.  After he started school he had less energy to put into the relationship, and broke up a month later with that reasoning, which seemed reasonable to me. When we broke up I was super sad for about 3 months. It took me 2 of them to cry, but it was the first time in a decade I had done so. I still cannot walk along some streets in my hometown without recalling how despairing I was. 


With that said, two months before the breakup my feelings had already diminished from the strong burn they had been at. Part of this was the normal wearing off of endorphins. Part of it was how I interpreted his lack of energy - and his comments, when I brought this up, about how he’s become jaded from past relationships and generally less attached - as him caring less. This made me more anxious - and more edged and withdrawn to match.


This shift in attitude made our differences more clear and more burdensome. I’m not like him. I’m experimental rather than committed, broad rather than deep, theoretical rather than practical, and - as he’d maybe put it - white collar rather than blue. I grew tired of mostly talking about the couple of topics he’s interested in, but was too insecure about my shallow knowledge to bring up my own. I started feeling more worn when he shut down - sometimes impatiently - the half-formed arguments I have a habit of making. I could not help but to feel like his opinions were narrow and self righteous, his questions were critical, his counterpoints were mocking. I perceive our interactions as periodically losing warmth.


This has generally been the trend - sometimes we trade memes and light hearted comments, but the light stuff all feels limited and unsatisfying and the heavy stuff makes me feel hurt and bitter. On Tuesday he said “it’s genuinely exhausting talking to you” and I don’t disagree. Talking to him is tiring now. I told him “then don’t” because I don’t want him to waste his time on something that doesn’t provide a return. But I’d rather he talk to me and we somehow make our conversations worthwhile again.


I stayed his friend because he’s an admirable person. His integrity challenges me to clarify my own moral stance and live up to my own self image. His passion inspires me to think more about the community I live in and to develop a deeper knowledge about those subjects I’m curious toward. His reasoned arguments push me to more conscientiously develop and defend my own - to become a proponent rather than a dilettante. I’d like to become able to appreciate all of this again, but I don’t know how to and don’t know if it’s worth doing.

Even though she was good looking and was very jovial I didn't bother much about her as I was going through a phase where I was fed up of girls and thoughts of relationships in general due to previous disappointments. After a few weeks she used to initiate talks with me even with random topics like showing a video of how a flood completely destroyed an area. 

As months passed by I started liking that girl beyond a point after she once said that she'd rather start her own business than writing code for a software tech. Few weeks before she used to talk for consecutive 3 or 4 days once she entered the office and one day all of a sudden she stopped initiating the talks. She does reply whenever I talk but not as self initiated as she does with others. 

Her behavior became erratic since she suddenly at one moment comes up and shows that she gave a dinner treat to a guy(an older teammate who is married) and when I asked ""Nothing for me? "", she replies mockingly "" Why should I, I'll give treat when you give me"".She also avoids talking anything to me in cafeteria but picks up on any point if it is about teasing me. I tested what her reaction would be when I hide my phone chat from view/move to another spot whenever I was talking with a friend about my situation with her and she literally asked me who I was so secretively talking to such that I was hiding my convo. 

After gathering advice from a few friends, I started ignoring her. She continued making jokes on me day before yesterday and I showed myself to be pissed off. She immediately texted me after she left office apologizing since I wasn't behaving normal that day. 

I immediately replied her asking if I was the only person who wasn't behaving normally and she was shocked since I asked that question and asked if everything was alright. I replied a big NO. 

Thanks to the stupid network issues in my area, my messages couldn't reach her for almost an hour and she got pissed off and literally shouted over the chat on why I wasn't replying to her question. I replied calmly explaining the network lag and she said ""ok, good night"".Now I got pissed off and immediately asked her to look up on my previous chats to check how she quickly replied to my texts and she didn't give an answer for that. 

I straightaway asked her why she was acting weird to me for the past 3 weeks and she plainly refused that she didn't mean anything like that. She also suddenly changed the whatsapp story to a pic of her parents in between our chat and when I asked if she's upset over something because that's usually the time when someone misses their family. She replied "" Yeah may be I am upset but I donno"".I told her she could share if she really felt like it and she said she wasn't upset over anything. She even added a pic of a random idiot to her story just to make me jealous but I didn't bother. I went on to say that she should stop worrying over anything, since I was concerned a bit more than the others. 

The next day she was back to square one but wasn't mocking/teasing but rather talking generic stuff to me like asking to not hurrying on eating snacks till a certain teammate arrives and asking for my share of money for the snacks to pay. I started ignoring her again and the only time she looked at me was when I was leaving office before her and she stares for like a few seconds. This is the 2nd time she was staring while I was leaving office before her. 

I am really divided between the suggestions provided by my friends as half suggested to let her know my feelings and the other half told me to wait for some time, keep ignoring her so that she can get some space to think and then propose her if I wanted on my birthday which is literally 4 months away and then proceed. 

P.S:  Not the too many fish in the sea advice. I'm in India where most morons focus more on reducing others chances to get a girl than increase their own chance. As I said earlier I was previously fed up of girls but giving a try this time since I felt there will be a different result this time.

The relationship has certainly had its ups and downs, but there have been periods where we fought a lot, had a dead bedroom (even an overall lack of intimacy) (the longest spell of this was \~9 months).

We have had good times in our relationship, we have traveled together, but we have some fairly serious issues.

Her problems with me include that I often arrive at her house late (usually not when we have time-sensitive plans, but I still understand her frustration completely); that I get offended easily and that she feels she cannot say things to me; that I have trouble with indecision; and that I have historically gone from one extreme to the other in things like exercise and hobbies.

My problems with her are that I don't feel supported by her (I have gotten into photography recently and am aware that I'm an amateur, but she refers to me as a ""photographer"" and says that it's just a waste of money and so on); she can be very rude and unproductive in fights (name-calling, saying ""fuck you,"" things like that); and she in general has said things like how she isn't really attracted to me and things like that.

I have spoken with both of my therapists about this situation and they both seem to be behind me in making some real decisions here, whether that be couple's counseling or breaking up. My girlfriend is pretty averse to couple's counseling though, so I don't think that's an option.

If anyone out there can give me any advice, I would deeply appreciate it. I feel very lost here.

Update: She seems to not want to break up (we kind of talked about it last night, for roughly the dozenth time, and I'm not exaggerating) but she's also said some things that point toward wanting to break up. I'm even more confused now.

t2_2wlpaju3,1553791627.0,b6l5sh,t3_b6l5sh,1,"We broke up about 7 months ago after 6 years of dating. It was a clean break. We haven’t spoken to each other since the breakup. I handled the breakup pretty well. I grieved the relationship, but I didn’t let the breakup break me. I’m in my third and final year of law school, and the semester my ex dumped me was actually the best I’ve performed my entire law school career. My grades last semester were phenomenal. I also made and strengthened a lot of good, healthy friendships. I dated around (not slept around) and have lots of funny stories from it, and I’ve also met some good guys. I’ve gotten closer to my family. I’ve loved being single these past few months. I’ve never felt happier or more myself. 

Despite being so happy, I still really miss my ex. I want to talk to him again. I want to see him again. Whenever I’m feeling anxious about anything, I think about him holding me, I think about his hands, his voice and it comforts me. I have trouble sleeping and sometimes when I wake in the middle of the night from a nightmare, the only way I can fall back asleep sometimes is by thinking about him and all of our wonderful memories. I’ve made peace with the breakup. I don’t realistically believe we could be together again, because I would never be able to trust him not to leave me again. But I just miss him so, so much. I miss what we had, and I’m afraid I’ll never love anybody as much as I loved him. 

Should I contact him? I just want to hear from him. I want to know what he’s up to, hear his voice, make sure he’s doing well. I don’t like trying to pretend like he doesn’t exist, like he’s dead, like we never happened, like he was nothing to me. Why does it have to be that way? We had something special.

t2_3fpyiunp,1553710459.0,b67mh6,t3_b67mh6,79,"Hi guys. First time poster. On mobile. Sorry about the formatting etc. 

So let me throw in some backstory. I’m a junior in college and this girl is a year behind me. We’ve known each other since I was a junior in high school where we went to school together, so we’ve known each other for almost 5 years now and we’ve been best friends that whole time. 

Because of this, we were obviously very close. For a long time we would see and talk to each other every day. We’d gossip and spend the night together and for a while we were even planning on moving in together. (I should mention that I am gay, and am in no way attracted to her and I don’t believe she has feelings for me in that way, just so that doesn’t misdirect the advice I’m looking for). 

For reference in this story my best friends name in this will be Jordyn. All other names will be fake but the people and the stories are real. 

So when I met Jordyn she was single but she definitely didn’t stay that way long. She started dating a friend from school in our group of friends who’s name will be Carter. Jordyn and Carter dated for about 9 months, and for 6 of those months Jordyn was regularly having sex with Michael. Meanwhile Michael had been in a relationship for almost 6 months and had been cheating on her (she’ll be Amber) almost the entire time. 

I found out that Jordyn and Michael were cheating on there significant others, and because of certain circumstances I won’t go into, I had to live with Amber during the end my senior year of high school. Amber found out what was going on from me, which led to Carter finding out, which led to Jordyn wanting nothing to do with me and blaming me for getting her caught, and also led to Michael trying to kill himself. Big mega mess that by now has otherwise been resolved.

Jordyn and Carter broke up. Amber forgave Michael and they’re still together now. 

The problem is Jordyn started dating someone else 6 months later. Three months into that relationship she was cheating on him with Carter. Again I was the reason her boyfriend found out she was getting involved with someone else. This happened my freshman year of college while I was still close with my group of friends at that time. 

When she went to college, she came to the same school I am still at now because we’re both not super wealthy and it’s close enough to commute. She started dating this guy at our school and because he wasn’t super close with our friends I guess she thought she was in the clear because he wouldn’t find out. 

Jordyn recently celebrated her 19th birthday and in that same week a few days later, we went to a work party with a mutual friend that I was working with at the time. This friend will be Josselyn. Josselyn had a cousin who worked with us and I agree with Jordyn that he is very attractive. Him and Jordyn had a thing for each other and he was at the party and came with us to the bar that night. Afterwards they ended up at another coworkers house and had sex. I had gone home but found out from Josselyn what had happened. 

At the time Jordyn and her current boyfriend were “on a break” but being on a break means taking time to figure out whether or not you still want to be together, not using that time to sleep around. For a few days I stressed about it and decided that her boyfriend should know what she did. I didn’t talk to her about it first as she’s lied about it in the past and felt that if I consulted her first I wouldn’t ever get the chance to tell him again. 

After I told him, she unadded me on everything and didn’t say a word. Her and the guy are still together because she told him that she had sex with someone else but spun it to sound as if it was just because she was too drunk. I know she was sober and that she fully intended at the start of the night to have sex with him. She had begged Josselyn to take them to the coworkers house because she thought she had a shot with her cousin, she picked the lock on the car door so they could lay in the backseat of Josselyn’s car, and she specifically set out to have everyone leave (they went to Taco Bell and left Jordyn and Josselyn’s cousin alone) so they would have privacy and then proceeded to call her boyfriend while she was having sex with Josselyn’s cousin. 

When Jordyn unadded me and stopped talking to me I didn’t reach out and decided I didn’t need a friend like that and I felt I was better off without her. 

About a week ago she reached out and wanted to talk things over because she “wasn’t mad anymore.” We were friends for a long time and figured the least I owed her was time to talk. We met somewhere public and it seemed okay but I don’t think I should get involved in a friendship with her again. I told her that we always fight whenever I tell her boyfriends that she cheating and she always seems to feel the need to cheat. 

I’m now realizing how long this really is, and I’m very sorry. It ended up being a lot more than I originally thought it would be. But long story short, does anybody have any advice for me on this topic. I do care about her and want to see her be better and sometimes it seems like she’s making progress and then it blows up in my face and I’m left feeling guilty for her actions. 

For anyone who stuck around and read this whole thing please help me decide what to do. Do I give her another chance or is enough enough and just cut her off completely?

Edit: when I say she intended at the start of the night to have sex with him, I want to clarify that I know that intention didn’t change and that she actively was trying to get with him. Afterwards she was still all over him cuddling and making out with him, and proceeded to call her boyfriend to confirm her plans with him the next day. I’m say this because this level of lying and dissociation with reality is genuinely concerning to me as I’m starting to legitimately worry about her mental health. 

TL;DR - My best friend consistently cheats on her boyfriend. I always seem to get caught in the middle and it makes me feel guilty. I don’t know what to do.

Well, we stayed friends on social media and we used to chat a couple times a month. Then in December of 2018, he sent me this long message that he had never stopped thinking of me, was an idiot, and wanted to try again. It seemed so sincere, so I gave him a chance. Well, 3 months later, I'm regretting it. It took us a little over 2 months to even hang out for the first time, and then we did for 3 weeks in a row before he didn't see me last weekend. We still are talking everyday, but sometimes lately it seems he's taking longer to reply, like this last time he went 17hrs without opening my message. Yet, he was definitely awake. He usually sends me good morning messages, but he didn't today.
Now, he's saying he isn't sure if he can this weekend either, after telling me last week that we were just skipping that weekend. So, to me, it's pretty clear that he's lying, because I've asked him if he was really still interested etc. All the time, he tells me he is, he's just busy, blah blah. And I almost feel like he borders into gaslighting me by telling me that I'm essentially overthinking everything and we're fine, even though I've been noticing things were off.
Also, it took him over 17 hours to look and reply to my last message, which was about hanging out, and he said he'd ""let me know"". As if MY time isn't important. I'd like to know if I should keep my schedule open or not. Then, I realize that if I made other plans, he wouldn't even care. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point, because I know he actually is having it rough. But this is also not acceptable to me. Can anyone just please tell me that I'm not being crazy or unfair here? That I would be making the right move to end it if he can't make time for me this weekend? Also, I haven't even responded to his message yet, about not being sure if he can do this weekend. I am upset with him and want to go off, but I also want to wait to see if he will make the time or not before I tell him off. Should I tell him that if he doesn't see me, it's over?

For some context, I’ve been a relationship (with different people) for around the past 7 years, I haven’t really “dated” much. I got out of my last relationship in December of last year

I have been currently seeing a former friend and classmate of over a year (who I had a minor crush on) for the past few months, but I’ve soon come to realise that he might not be the one for me. He’s very overly affectionate, always wants to be around me (I’m an introvert) and constantly offering to do everything for and pay for everything. This is what initially attracted me, especially since he asked me out on Valentines Day, and I realise this sounds like the ideal man for some, which means I can’t give him a reason that he wasn’t paying enough attention. 

Its also dangerously veered into “relationship” territory. He’s often kept an extra towel at his place “just for me” and has left his toothbrush at mine. I’ve also been going through a mild depressive period (due to switching to a different BC pill) and I’ve been prone to spontaneous fits of crying, which has often happened when we’re together at night and he’s initiating sex, damaging his self esteem further. 
He’s been as kind as he can to take care of me and being there for me, but has also started offering to take me out to (expensive) meals and telling him that he can only be happy as long as I am (his words)- which again ends up putting a lot of pressure on me to appear happy. 

I’ve tried to have a conversation with him to back off and not put pressure a few times but it doesn’t seem to have gone through, hence the reason I might have to break it off. However, since we are classmates- we see each nearly everyday and live around 5 minutes away from each other that makes it even harder to deal with. He’s also mentioned how he can only be truly sad if I break up with him which makes me feel even more devastated to break up with him. 

So my question is, should I break up with him (because my brain is too addled with the depressive episode) and if so- what’s the kindest way to let him down after he’s done so much for me?

As for the issue, I latched onto the cleat but for some reason the shelf is titled down. Due to the positioning it’s clear there is no way it can hold nearly enough weight. I’m not sure if adding the extra screws through the top, which will level the unit will still provide enough support.

The knobs were very difficult to reach so I did the best I could to tighten. It doesnt tilt up or down easily when I try but the TV DOES move Left and Right if I try moving the TV. It glides on the mount. There are two screws to tighten at the top and the instructions said not to tighten very much (so I didnt). I believe I did everything correctly. Is the left and right movement normal or should it be fixed into place and not move left and right at all?

Hello everybody! So I've been dabbling in woodworking with hand tools and my wife wants me to build this for our wall. It will be 2 4x8 sheets of 1/2"" plywood, hung horizontally on my wall, with the lower sheet being slightly shorter than 4ft and everything faced/covered with barn wood/reclaimed wood that my wife loves to hide any lines/faces. I'm debating on a few methods of hanging these, the first being a french cleat for both with a spacer (screwed into studs), but I'll probably end up lag bolting/screwing them into the studs. This will hold roughly the same amount of shelves seen, and my 65"" TV (mounted using t-nuts from the back to bolt too). I kind of want to make sure/see if there is an easier or more appropriate method to this or if the lag screws will be solid enough. 99% sure that's fine.

&amp;#x200B;

The real meat of the question is the shelves and what-not. I have a 16 month old daughter who likes to climb, and I know that even with proper supervision there WILL be a time that she's hiking herself up this like a ladder. It's inevitable, she's an evil genius already. My original idea was to do 1/2"" ply boxes (think floating shelves) for all the horizontal and veriticals with headers to support them (2x2 and 1x2 or something) or pocket screwed into the backboard every 6 inches or so. I just worry about those coming loose due to leverage and I'm not sure how big the ledgers would need to be or the best joinery to use either. I think I've way over analyzed this, but now I'm thinking of running 2x8 or 2x6 ledgers on the long horizontals and then using similar wood to support between them like a wall and lag bolting those into place from the backside. Or using a french cleat for everything on the face so i can take it off easily in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

so the TL;DR is I've read myself into circles on the best way to attach the vertical and horizontal shelves onto the plywood so that it will be sturdy enough for possible/eventual child mounting.

I completely refinished my floors with a drum sander, edger and buffer and I thought they came out great. I took a few millimeters off as I can see in some of the corners. The original floors had some water spots/dark spots where the original owners had a plant. I sanded it down like crazy until you couldn't see it and the stain went on fine. But just now when I was putting the finish on it pooled or set wired where the old spot was. What can I do to fix it? I have done 2 coats so far of varathane satin floor finish. Water based.

Soooo the plaster board on this wall got wet from either condensation on the cast iron pipe or a leak a while back. Either way it had to come down to repair. As I'm going to put up the new board I noticed the pipe sticks out at least a half inch past the studs. There was no sign of this with the old wall up and I tried putting a board across it and pushed it to the studs and of course it cracked. How could they have possibly put board and plaster on there without it showing? How do I go about getting around this? There is also a door on this wall so just simply sistering the studs and building out the wall doesn't really work without building out the door jam. Plus there was already a wall there!! I shouldn't have to!!

I hope this is something minor but I don't feel too good about it. This happened between yesterday and today. I've posted our texts to illustrate. 

(Roughly paraphrased)

    Me: Do you wanna go swimming tomorrow? 
    Her: I think not, I have a lot of work stuff to do 
    Me: Alright, your work is more important 
    We then talk about other stuff
    Her few hours later: Are you still up for swimming? 
    Me: Sure anytime, wanna go (place)? 

(30 mins later, I think this is where she changed her mind but she does not say it directly)

    Her : But the weather forecast says it's gonna rain tomorrow 
    Me: It'll be fine we'll check the forecast again tomorrow morning 
    Her: Okay babe 

(Next morning)

    Me: Weather looks fine, let's go swim 
    Her: What time? 
    Me:  Afternoon? 
    Her: I think I don't wanna swim cause it'll cause my hair to fall out 
    Me: Oh okay, why would your hair fall out? 
    Her: Cause the chlorine makes my hair dry blah blah blah

    Her: I just thought of it 
    Her: Sorry babe, I'll make it up to you
    Her: I still have work stuff to do, let's hang out soon

We have been together for a little over three months and this is the first time she's bullshitted so much to cancel a date, my theory is that she does not want to flat out reject me, or she dug a hole for herself after asking if I still wanted to swim after she said she was busy. I really don't mind if she just flat out says she changed her mind or that she just doesn't want to go. It's a shitty feeling being lied to and I hope this does not make her a compulsive liar or will it cause problems in the future. If she does this again I'm definitely calling her out.

t2_172yeo,1553788405.0,b6khmf,t3_b6khmf,5,"Hello,

I (22M) have some problems dating this girl S (23F) and here is our story:

We met in June 2018, during a university summer course on a campus many hours away from both of our home cities where we knew nobody (which are not the same, by the way). From the first night, we clicked. Everything was perfect from the get go and and I think it took two or three nights before my campus apartment could be considered abandoned and so it went for about a month+. We got very serious and kept talking about keeping everything going even after the course was over because of how much we liked eachother.

Worth mentioning is that she has family in the city I live and after the course and housing in the remote city ended, plus a couple of weeks apart from eachother in July because of work trips abroad, we started seeing eachother in my home city, however, things were not the same. We had talked during most of the time apart, but not all. We met a few time both at my place and her family's (I had met her mother) as well as outside around the city, often going for a walk to talk about what is going on and what is going to be.

Another important part of this is that being my home city, I knew other people. There absolutely was none I had ever met like S, but sure there are others. I did not have anything defined or serious with anyone, however, there was one girl I had been kind of close to for a long time when I met S and we were still in contact(on the phone) during the month with S and she(not S) wanted us to become serious. She, girl of my home town, had wanted this for a long time but I have always said no. Anyway, this story is not about her. I obviously let them know about eachother and I suppose that's where it went south together with the time apart. I tried to make it work with S, telling her I wanted everything we had talked about and she agreed but things felt off. She didn't want to tell me personal things anymore, she could often just be quite instead of responding to questions and didn't want to show her face on pictures etc. 

Being in the end of July, some relevant events were coming up in August. First one being her birthday, second one being home universities starting up meaning she would leave my city to live far away, meaning we would not meet much more than maybe a weekend or two per month. This was what I was thinking about and probably she too. I tried to meet her as much as possible to talk and make her get back to the super happy, funny and outgoing person she was just a couple of weeks ago, that was making me/us fall in love. I tried many ways to get her activated (different activities, questions, gifts, whatever) but she did not. This is where I made the decision that I now regret because of the consequences. I decided we were not happening (she surely didnt seem to want it too much anymore) and did not join her birthday celebration she had invited me to, at a hotel in a neighbouring city (she was there with all of her family and some friends). After this, things kept on breaking down. We soon lost contact and I was pretty sad about it. Tried with some phone calls but her holding back just got worse over time.

During autumn and winter, two things happened. One is that I spent more and more time with the girl I had known for long, after a while even deciding to try for a relationship and move in together in her apartment. During this relationship we didn't ever find a way to make it great. I guess I should have known, since I had held her away for 1 and a half year at this point but then just let it happen as an alternative. She definitely noticed and often asked about my thought about S. I wasn't too comfortable talking about it. I didn't find it appropriate. Mind you, there were very definitely good times between us, but also pretty bad ones spent mostly fighting over things, not getting along. The other thing that happened actually happened twice. It was that S tried to contact me, or that's what she calls it. I thought a lot about my time with her when we were apart, but even more when she wrote. The problem was that I was convinced she didn't want to make us work except during the summer that we had and what she wrote did not indicate much else. She wrote in the middle of the night, once asking ""Can I ask you for some advice?"" to which I said ""yes"" the morning after and in return got a ""Nevermind. I just had too many drinks"". The other time being at new year's eve, also late and after some drinks. This time was different. She wrote right out that she wanted to see me. I was super excited, yet sceptical. I asked why and she said I probably know. She offered to talk about things sometime in person and I agreed that we should. I was still in the not-so-good relationship and I told my gf right away about S Writing, showed her the messages and added that I actually wanted to know what she wanted to tell me. Gf proceeded to concact S to ""make sure you didnt already meet"" (gf had been abroad for a couple of weeks over new years). We hadn't met, so apart for being unhealthy controlling and uncomfortable by gf and for S, things were fair. After their conversation, S wrote to me that she had heard from gf(this is how I got to know about their call) and said she was sorry she contacted me. End of story for a few weeks. 

Gf goes for another trip and a few days in, she decides to break up with over text. I was pretty shocked because I didn't think anything major had happened at the time. We had been together for many months now and there I was, alone in our/her apartement while she was traveling. She told me she didn't think I loved her as she loved me and that she never wanted to see me again because that would make it hard for her. I asked her a lot what was going on but just packed my things, met her to talk about it once she got back, in a try to make me understand, then left. She didn't last long before she tried to talk to me and get us back but I wasn't into it. I had realized it really wasn't good and that I indeed had been thinking about someone else, specifically S. I went solo for a few weeks  then decided there is no reason to wait and contacted S.

Today, we have been in talked for a month and met both in my and her home city. She is mostly back to the summer girl I thought she was and I am infinitely happy to see and talk to her all the time. My overall mood really goes up now that she is (kind of) around. We talk daily and most of the time I think we are going to last forever. It really feels to me like I have grown feelings for her ever since we first met and at this point I know she is the one for me. There are two problems with my hopes/plans, though:

1. She is still holding back a bit. She says she is insecure after trying so much last summer but being left by me and she does not understand why I didn't respond better to her tries of reaching me during autumn/winter. She thinks she really tried but I denied her and decided someone else to be my 1st choice. The times of her holding back is when I talk about future or personal stuff and around meeting her friends/family.
2. She has spread her view on me at the end of summer to all of her family and friends and it is bad. A lot of her friends at uni and around think I am the worst person on earth for her since I didn't make it work the first time and they are really really pushing that onto her, almost daily. Obviously she don't want to lose her friends and I don't want her to either.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not looking to be shamed by you because of my decision to be in a relationship without love. I sincerely wish I had not, since it has really hurt me over time. Please try to be kind about it and help me out with the girl I am in love with if you have some advice.

What I'm wondering here is how to get further with this, as a long distance relationship? How can I help her commit or at least not hold back? How can I lower the influence of her friends, that really really makes her insecure about me every now and then (even though I manage to get her back on saying she wants me/us pretty soon afterwards, they come back and are many. I don't know how long I can convince her over and over and over)? Or at least convince her friends to let her give us a try? Is it possible/normal to get back together and make it work?

I have tried to explain as well as I can but am glad to add edits/comments explaining other things. Also, if I added too much, please tell me so I can make the text shorter. I don't post much and English isn't my best.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR! I am in love with a girl I was with for about 2 months last summer, but barely talked to until one month ago. In the downtime, I was in a very bad relationship. Now she seems afraid to commit even though we surely seem to have the same feelings for eachother.",relationships,"I (22M) am dating a girl (23F) for a second round, but her friends are against me and she is holding back"

Throw away account for obvious reasons, but at the same time if my SO found this, this would be very obviously us, RIP. I am putting the TL;DR at the top, actually, so you understand what you're getting into.  
 

TL;DR: My SO and I are from two different countries. We have a really intense/deep committal relationship, and I don't want it to end. I have four months to ask him if he would maybe want to move to my country for the next 4 years or so so that I can finish schooling. I am really nervous on whether or not this is the type of relationship where such is appropriate/if I'm of age th I can be having this talk...nd if I am where to start.  
 

**The specific question(s):** Should I/how should I suggest my SO to come live with me in my home country while I finish schooling. Are we too young? Is this relationship normal enough? Is this too quick? Is this what people do? Help help help.  
 

**Background of this relationship in terms of ups and down**: In November of 2017 I matched with a foreign exchange student at my University. We never had a formal date, just met up and talked; developing the kind of friendship you have where you can just sit and talk for hours and never get bored/be content. He was hooking up with a good number of girls and we never did anything, not even kiss, until about a month into us knowing each other. From November of 2017-now we have been through a lot of growing and redefining. From November 2017-January 2018 we were just friends with benefits. January 2018-March 2018 we were exclusive. I asked him for an open relationship in March because I felt like I wasn't enough for him sexually/was wasting his time abroad to go wild and hook up with people. This hurt him, a lot, and we ended up breaking up and not talking for two weeks. We had a long conversation there after and got back together, and was in an open relationship until August 2018, which was when I told him how unhappy it made me to know he was with other people at the same time, and it was one sided. I wasn't honest with him on how much an open relationship hurts me and when that watershed moment happened he was mortified and we agreed to become exclusive starting when he got home because when his study abroad year ended by (actual, genuine, universe manifesting) coincidence I started my study abroad year two weeks later in September of 2018, not only in his home country but his home city. Since September of 2018 until now we have been exclusive.  
 

**Background of this relationship in terms of intensity:** So with my timeline of this relationship it can be seen we have known each other for almost a year and a half now. Since we've met we have done a lot. We have traveled within my country to different regions for weekends. We've celebrated 2.5 (this .5 is actually super relevant, it will come later) birthdays. I've met his family, he's met mine. We spent this past christmas and new years together, with his family. We have met and have frequently hung out with each others friends. When we were in my country it was a 20 minute walk from his place to mine. Now, even though we are a bit over 1hr from each other via metro, we still see each other at minimum once every three days or so, and if we can't see each other at all during the week we will spend the whole weekend with each other.  
 

**Really significant things we've done for each other:**

*Me for him*: We have both done a lot for each other, especially in this September 2018-now period. As I said, my SO and I met at my University. He was actually in the law school and I was in the undergrad program. If it wasn't for matching, our paths wouldve never crossed. As he was a law student he had to pass the bar after graduation in July of 2018. Unfortunately, he failed. So he had to fly back to my country in February of 2019 to retake it.....and I went with him. I have a relative who lives about 2 hours by car from the testing center, so we flew in, stayed with her for a week, and split the cost for the rental car and an AirBnB for the days surrounding the test, saving him money and stress. I drove him to the library to study every day, made and figured out meals, brought him lunch the day(s) of so he didn't have to deal with the rush of stressed hungry bar takers, rubbed his back all night the night before when he had anxiety attacks etc etc. We spent 12 days in a row with each other, never separating for longer than the hours of his bar exams and it felt so normal. We studied, ate, slept, drove through snow storms, etc together and made out with our relationship stronger than ever.  
 

*Him for me*: Last week today, my health took a sudden turn for the worst. Walking up three stairs winded me, I was hot and had chills, I lost my appetite, talking was exhausting. I didn't go to class, which is uncharacteristic of me, and just felt off. It wasn't until I passed out in my apartment twice from just trying to go to the bathroom that I realized I needed help, and fast. I was able to drag my body into bed and sent an SOS text to him basically. He came and at that point shit was dire. I was delirious and had a high fever and hadn't eaten or showered in over 24 hours. He hoisted me out of bed and gave me a bath, made me food, tried to get me to eat (unsuccessfully) and called my mom back home to say what was happening. He called the ambulance for me and off we went to the hospital. When I arrived we found out that I was dangerously low on something in my bloodwork. Lets just say the average person needs 12-15 counts of this and I had 2.5. I basically was over halfway dead. He stayed with me from 8pm Thursday to 8am Friday. He spoke to doctors for me of my medical history (dominating language is not English in this country, and while I can manage day to day definitley cannot while on verge of death), of which he knew of, kept my parents updated back home, held my hand and wiped the sweat off my forhead while nurses and doctors picked and prodded and asked questioned and onwards. I have since been stabilized and am on the mend, but still am in the hospital. He has been my hero. He spends the hour commute everyday to visit me from late afternoon until after dinner, has brought chess, checkers, watched videos and TV and read books to me. This whole health crisis happened three days before my birthday. On my birthday he came to the hospital with a 21 candle, a card, and a mini present, he got permission and a wheelchair from the nurses and got me outside for the first time in three days and ran me around the hosptial grounds outside because I was too weak to walk still. He said that it was all he can do for now, but when I get out we are going to truly celebrate. (.5 explained). Since then everyday he finds wheelchairs and runs me around outside for an hour and its my favorite part of everyday....Also since I am abroad and being hospitslized is cash money, he has also been advocating for me and has made me aware of and has been fighting for to his best capacity my rights, cause he luckily can do things like read thick texts of legal insurance policy. This experience is what has given me the time to really think about us and think/realize how much I deeply love him and want him in my life.  
 

**Back to the question:** So I love him very very much. But an important and obvious note is that we are not from the same country, obviously. I only have four/fiveish months left here. We have both made it clear we do not want long distance. Something that we really both value a lot is time together. Not having alone time to just even sit with each other every couple of days is hard for us. So if we were to stay together one of us needs to make a move, literally. If I were the older I would've made a choice in a heart beat, but I'm not and I can't sacrifice my schooling. Even if I decided to, he has made it clear that he would never ever want me to sacrifice my schooling for our relationship, he would rather break up with me which would force me to stay in school than stand in the way of that, which I actually really appreciate. So now, I may need to ask him if he would maybe be interested in moving to my country, I guess?  
 

**Logistics**:  
 

So here is some things about us to gauge realisticness  
 

Him 

\-Finished with law school in my country and his   
 

\-Has no job yet and is just searching   
 

\-Fluent in three languages  
 

\-Interested in pursuing other/higher degrees  
 

\-Was/is fond of my country  
 

\-Has citizenship and in country and a degree level where the ability to get a (work permitting) visa in my country to would require 'only' getting a job offer and would cost about $500 and has a very very short processing timeframe.

&amp;#x200B;

Me   
 \-One year of undergrad(International relations)+3/4 years left of law (yes, I wanted to do law before I met him) left in my country   
 

\-Since I was little never felt a desire to live long term in home country/dream of living abroad  
 

\-Fluent in two languages, high level in a third (the langauge of his home country)  
 

Us   
 \-Have common country of duel citizenship between the two of us 

  
 \-Both have similar career path aspirations

  
 \-Both have same goals for family, financial's, travel 

  
 \-Love each other a lot  
 

**SO**. After all of this, lets reastate the questions...Should I/how should I suggest my SO to come live with me in my home country while I finish schooling. Are we too young? Is this relationship normal enough? Is this too quick? Is this what people do? Help help help.  
 

I am afraid of scaring him away, I'm afraid we are too young, I'm afraid that maybe there's red flags I'm missing, I'm afraid cause I've never been in a relationship this deep and sacrificial before, and it's terrifying. If we lived in the same country I would say that we have no plans on breaking up soon and things are going well. But with this deadline approaching, a conversation needs to happen, and soon.

So yesterday Cindy decided to break up with me, and that i could understand and relate to. Its the reasoning and the way she did it does not compute. She is upstairs packing the house we bought together (her stuff).

two nights ago me and her had a heated discussion/argument about her wanting to go back to a job from right when we met. It is a small bakery for very low wages and no benefits. I am very strongly against that idea not because of the money or benefits really, but it still weighs in. my large concern was about going backwards in life not growing as a person just finding a basic comfort zone or rut. That was the final straw for her. 


Her reasoning is that she didnt know if she could be an ""adult"". Life is overwhelming with her job (major companies call center) the hardest part for me to understand is that she never told me. I found out she was having breakdowns in the shower that i didnt know about them. Her reasoning for not telling me was because she thought she was being a childish millennial. She said its on her for poorly communicating to me what she wanted and needed. 

All i want to do is have her back and help her through things. I dont want her to be alone i want to give her love and support. She wants nothing to do with us as a relationship.  Going forward i want her back, but dont know how or if it is worth it. I dont know what stuff is relevant or not what you need to know to help give advice. 

TL;DR she broke up with me dont know how to proceed",relationships,Me [30 M] and my girlfriend [26F] of almost four years just broke up with me. I was blind sided looking for advice.
t2_3diqrixf,1553800174.0,b6mwlf,t3_b6mwlf,4,"Hi everyone. This one is a long one so strap in.

This has themes of mild violence and abuse flags, so if this isn't for you, you're warned.

At the time, I was 18F, now 20. He was 22M, now 24. She was the same age as me.

I met this guy, let's call him Loser, in November 2016, which happened to be my first year at university. He was volunteering for the theatre society that I had joined, having graduated the year before, as a pianist. 

We quickly became an 'item', with me hanging out around band rehearsals. This carried on until Christmas when I went home and we kept in contact. Home is stressful for me and I had a small mental break (nothing major). I didn't think much of it, but apparently he did. When I came back to uni everything carried on as normal and I thought we were fine. 

I didn't realise at the time, but he was isolating me from my friends and slowly caused me to cut off most of my friends in the process.

At the same time I became friends with another fresher and we hung out a lot. I considered this person a friend. We'll call her Nutter. As the semesters went on, they started talking. I was fine with it as I trusted them both and thought as we were all in the same society it was fine. 

Skip ahead to May and my birthday. The aftershow for out society's production fell onto my birthday night and we all went out and celebrated. I drank waayyy too much and ended up... Sick in the bathrooms. My housemate and friend who was there suggested taking me home.

By this time I had my suspicions about them. Nutter had wanted to talk to me a few weeks before, but had chickened out last minute. 

Loser ended up staying out until 4 in the morning where he called me to let me into he house. We went to sleep and that was it.

Move to mid June. This was where halls moved out, but those who lived in university houses (like me) could stay until July. This was when my two housemates that were left sat me down and told me that Nutter and Loser were having an affair since March, just after we'd signed for our student accommodation for second year.

I was (understandingly I hope) upset and went off at both N and L over text. 

Unfortunately, I had a week over summer when L was supposed to be coming to my parents house and we were taking a trip to where we had both (separately) spent holidays with our families. I even met his brother (who was very lovely and courteous).

Now comes September. I wasn't in a good mental state as I knew I'd have to live with Nutter and a few other people. I considered the rest of them friends, despite growing distant over the next few months. Unbeknownst to most of us, N and L had basically become a thing. 

We had a games night, with only me, N, another housemate and L.

This is where things went wrong.

I slept with L that night. I was stupid, I know, but I had that brief glimmer that I'd get something back from him. Turns out, 24 hours earlier he'd asked N to be his girlfriend.

In short, he'd cheated on me with her, and her with me.

She found out and claimed that I'd come onto him and didn't want to hear my side - he wanted to talk to me then lifted up the duvet where he was staying on the sofa.

It then came out that they'd been seeing each other for a while, even seeing eachother over the summer. 

After this, we made some rules. He could visit... On the proviso that they tell us.

Absolutely fine. We could get out of the way and be fine. 

However, after 6 months, this rule got broken. He 'surprised' her after one of her shows and they both said nothing, as well as someone with them. They came home and shit hit. 

They came in and there was a vauge 'oh, I didn't know he was coming'. I went to stop them from going upstairs, I DID NOT WANT HIM IN THE HOUSE.

We had an argument at the bottom of the stairs, and I have very little recollection of what happened next.

All I remember is him moving with my hand on his throat to the wall behind him. 

Long story short for what happened next, I had a breakdown in the living room, called my mum, a housemate had to calm me down.

The next day, N and L went to the police to file a case, but retracted it later. They went to our uni and I was almost kicked out for it. I had to apologise. They never had to apologise for pinning all of the blame on me as well as putting me through the emotional strain of the year and a half this lasted. 

I don't talk to either of them anymore. I still get upset sometimes, but I'm working through my issues. I've found a new romantic interest a year after all of this happened, finally getting over my anxieties around trusting people.

I'm not sure what I did was right or whether I could have done anything better... Does anyone have any advice on moving forward from all of this personally?

TLDR: Guy emotionally abuses and cheats on me for another girl, he cheats on her with me, I'm seen as a bad person, rules are made so he can visit our shared house are then broken, I have a moment of rage and get angry, threateningly aiming my hand at his throat to push him back.

So, the title pretty much says it all. I am really sad and just kinda need advice I guess on how to move on. Back around the 2nd week of February me and my boyfriend went on a ""break"". During this time his ex-girlfriend reached out to him and next thing you know they have sex. He told me about this, I dealt with it and moved on. We have been in the process of reconciling over the past few weeks when she tells him this week that she is pregnant with his baby. I asked how far along she is and all he told me was ""about a month"". A few weeks ago she called him and ""pranked"" him saying that she was pregnant and he was like well its not mine because it was only about 2 weeks since they hooked up. Anyway... both me and some other mutual friends think that she may just be saying that she is pregnant to trap him and keep him around. She went off the deep end when me and him first started dating because he cut her out of his life to focus on our relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho... We broke up and I am heartbroken. Any chance of us having a future together is gone and it makes me really sad. We got into an explosive argument the morning after he told me and we exchanged some not so nice things that were really hurtful and made things worse. I honestly hope that she isn't pregnant, not because I would get back with him anyway, but because I know that she already has a 2 year old she can barely afford to take care of and my ex has a 4 year old that he is paying almost all of his paycheck to support. Seems like a bad situation all around.

t2_3hqgzray,1553799420.0,b6mr29,t3_b6mr29,1,"I met my gf back in August 2016, we clicked quite quickly and we liked each other almost instantly. When i met her she mentioned she lived in a nearby city to mine, an about 1h drive. This limited us to seeing each other about 1 day a week at most, usually fridays or saturdays because our schedules didn't match. 

There are some great things in our relationship and things i love about here:

* I find her ridiculously beautiful and attractive.

* She's not wasteful with money and neither am I.

* We get along well and can easily talk to the other.

* We have amazing sex when we have it.

There are some other things i really don't like though and this is why I'm making this post:

* We spend most of the week away from the other, so when I try to make plans in a way that I can include us having some intimate time during saturdays, she sometimes will start saying that I only care about sex. She then often tries to shame me for wanting to have sex with her and considering it something important/a priority. I dont prioritize it over other activities, I just try to make space for it because it's good and I like it.

* We almost exclusively see each other in my house or go out in my city because there's zero privacy in her house because she doesn't have her own room and her mom is *always* around.

* In order to see me weekly, during saturdays or any day pretty much, she has to have a reason other than *seeing me* to see me. So she always has to be giving excuses to her mom or lying to her so that we can see each other.

* She's particularly insecure about me looking at other women. For example, I used to freely follow and like pics of some people on instagram, from friends of mine to a few models. I wouldn't really care if she did the same with male models, but she got really jealous and started following all the women I follow. Including old classmates, my cousin, etc. I found this a little bit uncomfortable. I understood her discomfort though, so I unfollowed all the models I used to follow (less than 5), after all, looking at this content is a waste of time in my opinion.

* She's going to finish uni in 2 years, I'll be done in like 4 or 5 months and I plan to move to another country, where we live is not really a good place to live or work and most of my family live and are from where i want to go. And I feel like a long distance relationship is not going to work out.

(Also, I happen to have an IBD and my meds cost ~1k USD per dose every 15 days, which my local government pays for but not forever. It's a very corrupt government and I'm really lucky to have been able to get it for a certain amount of time but I need to be sure that I won't lack this medicine in the future. Where my family lives I can get it with a government subsidy that is more reliable than the one here.)

Anyway, overall, I don't really know what to do, I feel like these problems kind of make it really hard to see myself with her in the future for like forever. I want your opinion r/relationships, what can I do?

TL;DR: I don't see myself staying in my relationship forever for many reasons, and I don't know what to do about them. Most importantly, I plan to move to another country eventually after I'm done with my career, and my gf will take two years to be done with hers, I can't wait.",relationships,I [22M] really don't know what to do about my issues with my girlfriend [22F]

I moved out when I was 18 into the college dorms, moved back home the following year, and then moved out the year after to an apartment. I used to smoke a lot of weed and party, and I was unable to deal with my parents not letting me do these things, so I moved back out. My parents actually called the police on me when they found out I was smoking weed, which was the impetus to move out. Fast forward to 6 months at this new apartment, and my life was falling apart. I was spending days in bed, constantly smoking or drinking, my grades were awful, and I quit my job. I moved back home because I couldn't pay rent and because I felt that emotionally and mentally there was something wrong. My parents have kept me on the right track - they took me to a psychiatrist and made me join AA. My mom used to constantly remind me of my mistakes until I pretty much blew up at her and asked her to stop, which she respected. I am at an internship and I am close to graduating. I have come such a long way from when I was out of my house. I had literally planned out my suicide then, and now I'm a decently functional person.

My parents put a GPS on my car and my phone. My dad reads my texts and my Facebook messages. He even put some sort of software on my phone that tells him if I deleted messages, and always corners me if I delete any messages. My best friend and I were mainly the ones that smoked together. However, our friendship was about more than just weed. My parents don't let me see him (which I understand but am sad about), and argue with me every time they see that I message him. I told them that I wouldn't stop messaging them and that they could read my messages with him if they want, but they are still unsatisfied. I feel suffocated at home. I've been resenting sobriety and craving drugs and alcohol. I miss being able to see my FWB. My question is - do I have the right to ask them for more freedom? I've put them through so much, and they are still here for me and supporting me. Should I just clench my teeth and get through it, and move out in a year or so?

He and his girlfriend moved from a small town so that he could pursue post secondary. At first his girlfriend was a bit standoffish, as she didn't have a lot in common with myself and her boyfriends friend group. 

Over the years I have noticed a lot of red flag behaviors from his girlfriend. Most notably, she will get angry with him and give him the silent treatment if he is home late from game nights. She has also made very little effort to get to know his friends, and doesn't really engage in conversation. 

Fast forward to this past year. They are both in a lot of debt, and she convinced him to get a brand new car. This is a car they both have to pay off, but only she can drive it as he doesn't have a license. She has refused to drive him places she doesn't want to go, even going so far as to tell him to drive himself. She actually encourages him to drive without a license! Not only that, she almost did not 'let' him go to a movie because she didn't want to see it herself. He wound up in a 20 minute argument while my friends waited to give him a lift to the film.

We started dating on September. Everything was fine by then, we spent a lot of time together on weekends (we live in two differents cities but is only a 35 min car drive). Everyone from our enviroment loves us as a couple, we have a lot of friends in common and we fit pretty well with the friends we didn't know before, everyone thinks we are so ""goals"", they love the way we treat each other and how we help the other one. We're deeply in love, she met my parents on December and I met his even earlier, in November.

Everything was so good, so easy, we were so happy. But we decided to start birth control. She became uninterested in sex, and was pretty unstable. She cried a lot and everything she told me was that it wasn't about my at all. We considered that birth control hormones were making her being so depressive, and she stoped taking it. After stoping, everything was good again. She become again the woman I was in love with.

But, a few weeks ago everything started being like that, but without a birth control hormones to blame. She's super unstable. She's always saying she loves me, and that I'm not the problem, but I'm starting to feel frustrated. I think she's having some mental health issue right know. I don't know what is it, but she's a person that get very stressed and she's working and studying at the moment, and in my opinion she can't take that much pressure on her and she should focus in his studies right know. She had mental health issues before and she even went to a psychologist, a I think she should go again to therapy. She has been in this ""unstable"" status 4 weeks, and she also became super uninterested in sex, like simply proposing having it or trying to (you know, doing a massage, cuddling...) kind of offended her.

Yesterday, I tried to be constructive and as supportive as I could. I told her than I'm worried. I tried to explain that when she started to be unstable again I tried not to tell anything to see if it was something that stands only for a week or two, but wasn't like that. I explained her that not having sex is affecting my self esteem, feeling that my gf is not interested at all in sex makes me think that she doesn't like me anymore.

His response was that she loved me a lot, and feels super bad for making me feel like that. She told me that I don't deserve that and that maybe I should dump her because I shouldn't stay with someone that is making me feel bad, but I'm not agree with that, I consider that it has a solution and isn't fully break. She told me that she wants some time to think about everything, and of course I respect her decision. But I'm pretty worried thinking about she's going to break with me or if did anything wrong. I do really think she needs to search from help from a therapist, but she doesn't seem that she consider that an option right know. Can I do anything to help her that I haven't considered? Or I should just wait to see what she ends up after giving her space and time to think? Any tip to deal with her and convincing her to search for help?

Now he is saying that he doesn't CARE that she does pills as long as it's not around our baby. I feel he is enabling her and I don't know what to do. He says he can't control what she does with her life. 

 She will probably visit again to see our daughter. I feel like my husband needs to grow a pair
 I know she helps us financially and she is the only one family or friend wise that can help us if something happens. But this is ridiculous. 

I want to confront her myself though I have no idea what good it will do. It will probably just cause more trouble. But I will not sit idley by while she acts like a moron and destroys her family.

when she was dumping me I did not say a bad word about her or to her I took everything on the chin when I could of said many times well you can go and do one but I did not want to put her in that light as I always try and see the good in someone.

t2_2qlovu6y,1553776226.0,b6i6ym,t3_b6i6ym,4,"I know this dude and his girlfriend for the same amout of time, little over one year to be precise, as they joined our now mutual friend circle through my best friend. The three of us went clubbing with our mutual friends on numerous occasions and the girl, lets call her Lisa, and I always got along very well.

At the beginning of our friendship I noticed that I seem to really fall in love with Lisa, but I tried to supress my feelings because I assumed she was happy in her relationship and was just interested in a friendship. I never even had her phone number as we only met randomly if she was with her boyfriend, and they decided to hang out with us, as we usually do.

But whenever we went clubbing it was like we only had eyes for eachother, like we spend most of the time dancing and partying together while her boyfriend was roaming around the place, talking to strangers or flirting with other girls.

This has been going on for about a year, until 1 Month ago, where I dunkenly told her that I really adore her. I told her that I really like her personality and that I was curious if she had a sister or a cousin that was similar to her ( I know, not the best approach^^). She told me that she has a cousin but she doesn't want me to meet her, so I just shrugged it off and tried to forget the conversation as I was really embarassed.

Now to the problem: last Saturday, at 3 am, she hit me up on snapchat, asking if I was still awake and if I wanted to hang out, because she didn't feel good and needed someone to talk. Being the dumbass that I am I said sure thing, so I grabbed a bottle of wine and met her. She didn't seem sad at all to be honest, and we just chilled the whole night, drinking wine and having a great, deep conversation. She was talking about how she really appreciates me as a person and that she has always enjoyed our nights out, and thanked me for caring for her when her boyfriend didn't. She also said that she ofthen thinks about the things I said to her.

As u can imagine, no good things happen after 2 am, and eventually we started holding hands, talking about our feelings for each other, and making out. Now imagine how I felt that night, holding hands with the girl I have adored for so long, when she suddenly tells me that she has wished for this to happen since we first met. She felt exactly like I did for a whole year, and we both supressed our feelings because we both thought we were only interested in a friendship.

​

We have been chatting for the last days , and we came to the conclusion that we both really want to commit to this, as we seem to be perfect for each other, but our situation is what is stopping us. If she broke up with her bf, we would have to hide the relationship for atleast half a year, or our friends will hate us and most likely cut contact. and her bf would still be part of our friend circle, which doesn't make it easy either. 

​

Please don't tell me that this is morally wrong, we both know and we won't go further before she is single, but I would appreciate advice on how to handle the situation in general. Or maybe I just wanted to get it off my chest, who knows.

I hope it is coherent, I'm not a native speaker :) 

Cheers

Here's the kicker -- we went on a date 6 months ago and it ended the similar way. I tried to kiss her and she shyed away. I didn't think she was interested so it kind of fizzled out. But recently we started talking again.

I read some reddit threads on previous questions, like 'how to show a  guy you are interested' etc. and the consensus seems to be that guys can sometimes be clueless.  



There is an important little twist to this: I am his dog's veterinarian. I do house calls. It's not like human medicine where you have HIPPA violations and doctor/client romantic relationships are forbidden. Just putting that out there. 

So I went to see his dog, and I end up sitting down and we're just chatting. He's asking me all sorts of personal questions about myself (like get to know you questions), and says at some point, ""Hey, I heard about X thing going on, I really want to go!"". I was really tired after a long day of appointments, so I didn't pick up on the hint (is this really a hint? My friends think so). But I did after a good night's sleep. So I saw him a few days later (he helped me fix my car) and said, ""Hey, I looked up X, that really sounds like fun. Do you want to go?"".


His response confused me, it was, ""yeah, um,  I really want to go. If I head down there I'll give you a call"". He seemed...hesitant? Maybe a little uncomfortable/awkward?  So I said, ""ok, let me know, I'd really love to go!"" and left it at that.  It was a little strange because up until then, all signs (not going to bore with a list) indicated really strong interest. He seemed to really enjoy talking to me. I'm really clueless when it comes to this sort of thing, but it seemed super obvious to me (and the friends that I asked) that he really seemed interested in me.

Since then, there was about a month break where I didn't really hear from him, and then he texted me about a question for his friend's dog (why not just give them my number?).  I've texted a few times, just random, non-pet related things, and he always responds, and fairly quickly at that.

Did I read him wrong? Was I not clear enough that I like him? Should I give up? Be more blunt? Ask him if he's seeing someone? Idk. I don't want to miss a 'thanks no thanks', or be stupid and just assume on his behalf either.

I’m currently in my senior year of high school and my traditional Asian parents want me to take a gap year before heading off to university so I can help out with their furniture store business. I thought this was a great idea since and it’s a win/win because I get to help them while still maturing to figure out which occupational pathway I would like to follow.

So a few months after this I thought it would be a good idea to build a PC with some of the money I’ve gathered from my part time job. This would make sense because my current computer is a piece of crap and it would be a fun thing to do and have before I head off to university. 

When I brought this up to my parents, talking to them about how it’s sort of a graduation gift to myself, they flipped and told me it’s a waste of money and that I’m not allowed to do so. 

3/5’s of of my paycheque last year went to my parents and older brother as they were financially struggling and i was completely fine with doing so. now that theyve started a business thats been successful for a while, I thought it would be the perfect time to treat myself to something ive wanted for several years now.

My parents got upset to the point where theyre enforcing a rule to take my phone and headphones every night which is a breach of privacy and is completely unjustified.

My boyfriend Jason and I have been together for nearly 4 years. He’s not super close with his mom Anne, but she’s definitely a presence in our lives. They chat on the phone once a week and we see her on the major holidays.

She owns a bath product business and conducts the majority of her sales at trade shows each weekend around our area. Last year, she asked me if I had any friends who could help out over a weekend at a huge trade show. My friend Bianca offered. Anne agreed to pay cash and laid out the payment schedule to me to which Bianca agreed – I connected them and otherwise moved on with my life.

Cut to three months later, Bianca revealed to me that Anne had yet to pay her for her work (she was supposed to be paid at the end of each day). She told me she had followed up with Anne multiple times – she showed me screencaps of conversations where it was clear Anne was avoiding paying her, giving excuses about personal bills, etc. I was horrified. I told Jason, who called him mother immediately. Suddenly, Anne was on the phone with Bianca telling the money was definitely being transferred the next day. Of course, when the time came, she “forgot” how to e-transfer. Anne asked Jason to pay Bianca and she would pay us back. That was nearly a year ago and we haven’t seen that money since. I realize we bailed Anne out of that situation, but we could afford it at the time (it was $400 – not chump change but not life ending), and I just considered it a lesson learned to never help her out in that capacity again.  
 

Cut to this week. I’ve recently been laid off from a toxic job but offered a few months severance. Since I would be off for a few months, my boyfriend and I decided to get a puppy. I’ve spent the past month training my dog, taking a couple community college courses, and working on my resume. It’s been great. I just received a message from Anne: “Hi – Wondering if you are busy Friday and Sunday. I’m in a show and need help. I’ll pay you right there each day.” 

I don’t want to do this, for a few reasons. Friday truly is not realistic for me – I have an assignment due, a company has asked me to submit my resume for a position so I’d like take time to tailor it specifically, and of course, just watching our puppy. She didn’t inquire about Saturday because she thinks I’ll be helping her daughter move that day (I’ll actually be at home with the puppy).   
 If she had just said she needed help, I would be way more inclined – but by even making the promise of paying, my anger over the position she put me in with Bianca has re-emerged, and has reminded me we haven’t even been re-imbursed for that.   
 I’m looking on how to navigate this super uncomfortable situation. Jason is 100% on my side and knows that as nice as his mother is, she cannot run a business very well. He stepped in and handled the Bianca situation. He would with this as well, but she is going to continue to ask as long as I am off work, and I am not always going to have a legitimate reason. I’d love to figure out a respectful way to say that I can’t work for her, ever.

My eyes look more alert via mascara, and my lips actually have some color with a natural lipstick. I’m far more attractive this way and people’s reactions to me are always so positive.

I suppose I let this go on as long as I have because he has hid a few things from me and slowly revealed the truth over months of dating. One is to do with his appearance and he paid a bundle for a cosmetic fix for it. Unfortunately my issues aren’t as easy to get rid of.

While I wasn't specifically diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, I was told I have inattention towards things that are not related to me or aren't a direct benefit to me, due to a lack of empathy that actually developed later in my life after I became a Engineering major started to see everything in logical steps and solutions. I stopped thinking about how other people felt and instead focused on the logical progression of events and how they were arranged in my internal queue.  I didn't always have this issue, and my therapist helped me realize I had more empathy in middle/high school when I read more books, communicated more often with a variety of people, and did a lot of writing when trying to understand texts and pieces or literature and art. As a result, I'm trying to read more books, find a deeper and abstract meaning in pieces of literature and art, and just talk to more people besides my girlfriend and close friends. I also tend to go off on tangents when I don't know the answer, instead of saying ""I don't know"". However, it wasn't specifically for every person; I most often go off on tangents when answering a question my girlfriend asks me because for some reason, I shy away from appearing as if I don't know something. It was suggested to me that I might be afraid to show a lack of knowledge of anything to my girlfriend, which I don't specifically understand why because I don't think I feel that way, but it might be something underlying that I need to dig deeper in to.

I hit mine after I graduated and now that I am working FT and doing what I like I feel able to help her miss the speedbumps that really messed me up. 



During my crisis, she was still at university or study abroad and I do not hold it against her that she wasn't available because when she was, she was very supportive. Also, I wasn't a great communicator so I now know that's on me.

I have sat down with her, made goals, send her links to jobs, but she will maybe do a job application every two or three weeks. On top of that, she hates going out. I figured trying to get her to do things would help but she's refused hiking or concerts, and cites being broke preventing her from doing much except stay home and play video games. Her parent's house is only a 30 minute drive away from the city I live in, so it's not like she's stuck either.



I've been independent since I was 17, due to home issues, so it's reaching a point where I'm worried and frustrated on how to proceed. Even at my lowest points, I knew no one would help me get out of my hole except myself. Rina gets offended when I bring up therapy or pissy if I bring up her lack of motivation. Sometimes I feel like this isn't the Rina I remember. There are tons of opportunities in my city, but I don't know how to help her get back out the door.

I originally came on this subreddit asking for advice (I changed our ages because I was afraid he’d find the post) and have since spoken with a lot of my other friends about it. They’ve all expressed concerns that, despite my friend’s claims otherwise, he is not trying to get over me and is treating our friendship like a game he can win. I’ve also learned from them that he doesn’t actually talk to or about anyone but me, and he’s been actively ignoring the other members of our friend group when I’m not around. 

I reached out to him to have a discussion, and we’re meeting at a coffee shop tomorrow night so I can confront him about this. He’s never done anything violent or spiteful that I’ve seen, but despite this I’m really scared. I’ve been in a similar position before with other guys but they’ve always been more stalker-ish and not my friends. Others have advised me to be very safe and have offered to be present during the talk, and it’s giving me the vibe like they’re afraid he’ll react violently towards me. We’re carpooling to the coffee place, which is close enough I feel comfortable calling a car home, but suddenly the idea of letting him drive me there makes me nervous?

I intend to tell him that his actions are making me uncomfortable and that we need to take a break at the very least. I’m prepared to cut him out of my life if necessary. I’m really anxious about this conversation and I want to go in with a level head, because every time we’ve had these talks in the past he’s started crying and it’s up to me to calm him down if I want the conversation to continue.

I've had the best luck sanding the block at 120, then 150. Then I treated it with pre-stain.  The first coat dried so fast that I applied a second coat (I read this is ok). 

Next,  I applied a coat of stain that went on smoothly, so I'm good there (water based stain). It's the polycrylic that's killing me. I'm using Minwax's water based polycrylic clear gloss using a foam brush (not a roller). I've waited, at a minimum 2 hours; with room temps in 60s to 70s F. I'm not sure there's a benefit to explaining my process since I'm here asking for help. My problems with the poly have been:

* finding the balance of ""the right level"" of application. If dry spots appear during application, should I go back and reapply? I usually see this on the first coat. I've read mostly to go thin, but I've also read going heavier is find since you'll be sanding it down between coats.
* Minwax states to sand using 220 between multiple coats: agree/disagree?
* is 2 hours long enough to cure based on the temps I currently have? I really want to get that glass finish. at times I've waited over 4 hours before sanding down and applying the next coat
* cloudy finish when trying to get that glass shine. I've read the cloudiness could be not waiting long enough for the poly to cure
* should i use an orbital sander or not? I have sand paper for it. I'm thinking no since I'm new to this. It does have speed settings though...
* lighting. I'm working in the garage, but I try to get natural light by opening the garage door. This helps showing dry spots on those initial coats. But if I want to work on this at night, it's a problem with the overhead LED lights. They just don't show it as well.

t2_3hxi0eum,1553794428.0,b6lqtf,t3_b6lqtf,7," Hello all,

I'm a 22 year old male, and 3 days ago I broke up with my girlfriend for the second time. To fully understand the situation I will take you back to when we first started dating.

&amp;#x200B;

I was out with a bunch of friend, and met her in a club. This is an ex colleague I used to work with in a restaurant. We made out, even though she had a boyfriend. I texted her the next morning saying sorry for my behaviour. She texted back that she really enjoyed the night before and we stayed in contact. A few weeks later I fell in love, even though she was still in a relationship. Despite the fact that she was in a relationship, the love was concensual. She would keep telling me that she would break up with her boyfriend, but never actually did. Half a year passes and I decided to end contact. Lo and behold, she breaks up with her current boyfriend and we can actually start dating seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

We quickly become boyfriend and girlfriend. Though, it sometimes feel like I have to put in the effort and she isn't taking it too seriously. In hindsight it was probably because of her recent breakup, and I was too in love to care about it too much. In addition, she had a condition with which she couldn't have sex. Throughout or relationship I never had trouble with this, and repeatedly told her so.

&amp;#x200B;

However, things changed. For some reason, after a few months, she starts becoming really jealous to me. Whenever I mention a girl, work with a girl, or look at something without a penis she gets pissed off. This would go on for a few months until I had enough of it. She explained to me that she became this jealous because of her ""problem"". I tried to reassure her so many times that it didn't matter to me, and I still loved her unconditionally.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time I also found out alot of things about myself, for example that I have ADHD. Not only is this an attention disorder, it can also affect a lot of other parts in your life, for example relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

Our relationship was great, we did a lot of fun stuff, I trusted her with everything. She was everything I ever wished for and wish it didn't end up the way it did. Though, the jealousy kept going on. Then comes an evening of going out with friends, and I cheat on her. I still regret this to this day. The next morning I felt so much guilt that I break up with her. I didn't want to hurt her feelings and decided to never tell her. I'm a coward, I know.

&amp;#x200B;

She doesn't accept the breakup, she keeps texting me, calling me, and in the end looks for me when I'm out with my friends. Being drunk, I made out with her and she sleeps at my place. Within a few days we are back together again. We decided it would be best to stay together and work on ourselves. She would try to be less jealous, and I would work on my ADHD problems. For the first few weeks after that, the relationship is fantastic again. We do fun things, and she is not as jealous it seems. Though, in the next few months she starts becoming jealous at everything again, and we fall back into the same thing we had before. I know she loves me very very very much (maybe too much), and I love her too. She never really had anything going on for herself, I was her everything besides school and work.

&amp;#x200B;

For a few weeks I had the thought of breaking up with her. I was sick of lying about super simple stuff. I would lie about who I worked with (I would say I worked with a male coworker, even though the coworker was female), I would lie about what I was doing and why I couldn't respond to a call. I visited my parents house and told them how my relationship was, and explained to them how jealous she became. They told me to move out of the relationship, and that it was certainly unhealthy.

&amp;#x200B;

So I did. I was supposed to pick her up to stay the night at my place, but instead I told her I wanted to break up. Just like last time, it was no fun. She wanted to follow me outside but her mom stopped her, it was really really bad. I drove home that night crying all the way. 3 Days later, I'm still really sad about the whole situation. I decided to have a few beers this evening and am typing this now. I know she loves me unconditionally, and I love her too, but I can't take it anymore. It all became too much for me, I felt guilty over such stupid shit. In the end of our relationship I couldn't really tell what was actually bad, and what was just bad in her eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

On paper, our relationship was perfect, in reality, it often made me feel really shitty. I miss her though.. Damn I miss her so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this post doesn't make sense, English is not my first language and I've had a few beers. Cheers all.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I don't know if I made the right decision after breaking up with my girlfriend. My parents kind of talked me into it, but still I had it in my mind for a few weeks. My girlfriend was really jealous and had a condition that didn't allow her to have sex. I feel sad and lonely now, so I made this post to get things straight in my head. Even if one person reads this it's good. ",relationships,I(22m) broke up with my girlfriend(21f) of 2 years
t2_pnb8y3i,1553767205.0,b6gvub,t3_b6gvub,4,"My relationship with my girlfriend [18F] is more than healthy I would say. We basically spend everyday together; either going back home together from school or going on dates during the weekend or on breaks between trimesters. I know she loves me a lot and cares for me very much and I equal feel the same way about her. She’s also had a really rough past with her ex, few years back, who cheated on her so she knows what it feels like to be in the receiving end. 

But for some fucking reason I have this paranoia of her either cheating on me or breaking up with me. I basically only think about it when I’m not with her and especially when I find time to contemplate (e.g. in the shower) on days when I don’t see her at all. 

It could be that I just spend time with her too much or I think this relationship is too good that I start creating problems for myself. 

If it is, that I spend too much time with her the best solution may be to spend less time with each other but I really, really dislike that idea. It seems as if we’re putting a wall between us and it feels like what a dying relationship would do.

The paranoia is starting get worse and worse and I need help. Why do I keep getting paranoid and what should I do to stop it. 

tl;dr: very healthy relationship but I’m getting paranoid that my gf is cheating on me or going to break up with me. Need help! 

Edit: writing this made me realize some important points I should add. This my first real relationship I’ve ever had.

I realized that there are a few minor problems:
• my gf did dump me once around two years ago but that was because she just broke up with her ex and she wasn’t really ready for a relationship again.
• my gf has mentioned before that “I am just right” in terms of looks; meaning not too ugly nor not too good looking which has definitely hurt my self confidence to an extent 
• although I have warned her and she already stopped, she had been a little too physical with other guys: sitting on another guys lap, putting head on another guy’s shoulder, and kissing another guy’s cheek or kissing the lips of another girl (she is straight tho)

t2_3htoa7q4,1553746811.0,b6ebu6,t3_b6ebu6,9,"Hi there, I have been seeing my boyfriend for about 7 months and I really could go on forever on everything that I love about him.  After I ended my previous long term relationship early last year, I eventually started to go on dates and it always didnt feel right. I was starting to get that dread that I wasn't ever going to find someone I could connect with on multiple levels and of course thats when I met my current boyfriend. We started to get to know each other more and more, spent more and more time with each other and I totally fell in love and so did he. As our relationship started growing, I realized that he talked about his ex friend kinda a lot, I mean by ""normal"" standards. At first it didnt bother me cause I am still friends with my ex and so I get where the built friendship aspect of it comes from but it doesn't feel like its the same for him? I've expressed why I broke up with my ex and really I only have had very casual conversations with him once maybe every other week? My boyfriend is in group chats with her and really it feels like every time we hang out I make the mistake of looking over at his phone only to see a message from her. The subject has already been brought up and I'm pretty firm in my stance of not wanting to be that girlfriend that dictates who he talks to and I've expressed that to him. I let him know that I think it can be done but it'll take a lot of time to get it to where we want it to be, I've been genuinely been trying to not let it bother me cause I really feel like he wouldn't do anything to hurt me like that. but at the same time I can't help but let my anxiety take over and make me think about all the things that he's telling her and not me. I want to eventually talk to him about it again and figure where exactly this need to talk to her is coming from? I'm confused and don't really know how I should feel.  Any and all input is welcome.

t2_c4f54,1553743480.0,b6dudl,t3_b6dudl,14,"I've been dating this woman for 2 years now. When we first started dating, we got along great. We laughed, had fun, talked about things we enjoy (movies, music, etc). We also were supportive of each other. We felt comfortable talking about things that bothered us. We had a really good thing.

Over the last year, there's been less and less of the good. Every conversation we have is her feeling down or being frustrated or upset or worried. Thing is, being there and helping the people I care about is what really makes me feel like my life has meaning. So I'm happy to have her back and be her sounding board. But it's just so taxing. It never lets up. When I was doing my psychiatry rotation for medical school (a month ago), I felt like I was working every minute of every day even after I came home.

I realize it's weird to say, but I feel like my relationship with her is becoming parental. I feel like I'm a caretaker. Moreover, I feel like I can't come to her about the things in my life that aren't good because I feel like I have to be this pillar of strength for her. On top of it, she does this thing where if I ever even hint that I'm not all smiles and sunshine, she talks down about herself saying ""I'm stupid. You've been through so much more than me and your problems are so much worse than mine"" (she's obsessed with the fact that my mother died when I was a teenager and it left me with some mental health problems that I've mostly gotten past at this point in my life) and then she won't tell me anything for a week.

My boyfriend have been together for a year now. We are really happy, we work well together and I love him a lot. He was gonna move in with a friend of his at the end of the semester (Juli), but he is getting second thoughts about this. He doesn't want to stay where he lives now as it's a bit of a dump and his roommates and him don't get along very well.

I live 30 minutes by train, I have one roommate but she has mentioned moving out in June/Juli. Yesterday I was over at my boyfriends place and he told me how he doesn't wanna live with his friend anymore. And then went on to ask if we could discuss if he could have the room in my house. 

I on the one hand love the idea. I love him, we have talked about living together on a ""what if.."" basis and it sounds wonderful. However, 24 hours later I'm a bit worried. I think we could do it. But is it maybe too early? We will have been together for 1.5 years at that point and we are both 20 years old. I'm about to finish my bachelor and move on to a master, he is trying to get into art school. We both have jobs, he earns more than me for now with his own company.

I firmly believe I am not being a good partner to you and I am very ashamed and sorry for that.


Because of that I am afraid that you will leave me, since you won't find happiness or positivity with me anymore. You will find it in gaming with ""female friend name"" 

Also because of this I feel scared you will talk with your (in my eyes) almost perfect ex. I am letting these fear driving me crazy to the point of panick attacks and crying.

I am very scared of sharing this with you because I don't want you to see me as weak or ""less of a partner"" because then the above might happen and I will push you away with this. (That has happened before to me)

I am scared that I am not ready for a relationship yet that is so settling down. I don't know who I am anymore and I miss my old self.

I am panicking and am afraid so many times because of this that it has caused me to resent you for the choice that I made. It feels often like I am dead inside.

I do not know what to do with my life anymore and if I still want to live it. I do not have goals anymore or fun because the fear is just overwhelming.

t2_2rvfi56x,1553791333.0,b6l3le,t3_b6l3le,10,"Right now in our relationship, I'm deeply unhappy. I feel unloved, and my needs aren't getting met.

Suffice it to say, our situation is unusual and unique, and from the start I knew that my girlfriend had zero sex drive. But we still had sex on a regular basis, which I felt was a great gift from her, something she was doing for my sake because she loved me.

A half a year ago, that all stopped. And while that was frustrating, I might have been able to deal with that if that's all it was. But my girlfriend has completely shut off sexually. Any sort of sexual contact between the two of us is pretty much gone now. I know that none of this is anything that she cares about, but it matters a great deal to me, and it feels like she just stopped caring about my wants and needs.

I pled with her to try to work with me on this, to try to find some sort of compromise that we could both be okay with, that while I would be disappointed with the loss of sex, I wanted to at least have some semblance of that connection to her. She said she didn't feel that she should do anything she doesn't want to - no sacrifices or concessions, no compromises, nothing. I tried to explain that I felt that people who cared about each other tried to work with each other to try to find ways to make each other happy, but she wasn't having any of it.

I'm not demanding sex. I'm not demanding that we do everything I want. I'm not saying that only the things that I want matter. But it seems that my girlfriend has suddenly flicked a switch in her head and decided that *nothing* I want matters, if it's not something that matters to her too.

I've tried asking her to go to couples counseling, but she has no interest in going. And it's starting to feel increasingly like talking to a brick wall, someone who refuses to give an inch on *anything*, who doesn't care about my feelings on things, and doesn't even want to try to work through this.

We've been together for two years, and I feel like a half a year ago she suddenly decided to stop loving me. Not when she stopped having sex with me, but when she stopped trying to work with me on our relationship, and decided to make unilateral decisions for the both of us.

t2_3eos7wol,1553752979.0,b6f5wm,t3_b6f5wm,8,"I've known her for years now and we've always been best friends. We've mostly chatted since she doesn't live that close to me but we were always friends, since 2014. 

We never shared the same interests, but it was always alright, got over toxic friendships with other people twice. It just worked out.
Recently though, she's become worse. She was always psychologically weak, introverted and easily hurt. But i don't know how to deal anymore. 

If she makes sarcastic jokes, and uses offensive language, it's always ok because it was a joke. If i say one thing, she blows up, and ignores me and one other friend (18F) for a while after an argument. 
At Christmas she got really angry at me because i met my long distance boyfriend the whole time, and i forgot to hang out with her, which is understandable. I told her we'd hang out. But i had to apologize over and over again and she never really accepted it.

Now, months later, she tells me sorry, she forgot the date of a concert we wanted to go to since last year, got the tickets and all... She bought BTS tickets for that day, payed the flight and everything. I said i wasn't angry. Because honestly, I don't know anymore.

Talking about BTS, she's become a manic k-pop fan. Goes to concerts all the time, talks about nothing else. Posts on her WhatsApp, on her twitter, all about them. She asked me who i shipped her with the least, i circled one of the idols and wrote 'he kinda ugly' 

You won't believe how crazy she went.
She quoted a song with something along those lines of 'look in the mirror'. So she got at me basically with 'no you.' then told me how insulting and horrible i was for insulting this 'poor Teddy' and how he got hate so much and stuff. I don't know one thing about the band so, nice try. 
Then she called me stupid. Now she's ignoring me and the other friend since 2 days almost. 

She often plays the victim role, is allowed to do everything but i someone acts a way she dislikes, she explodes.

There also was a big fight because i was talking about what i achieved until now (I've had a hard time) and she took it as an insult because she felt she didn't have all that and didn't have any friends (one of my points on the list, amazing friends at school). 
But somehow now she's always going out to drink with her school friends? Just about 1 month later? She also didn't drink before. 

I don't know how to deal with this. We've been friends forever, went through a lot and i just feel she doesn't care that much about me anymore. What should i do? Should i tell her my honest honest opinion once, and not care if she escalates? Or start ignoring her?

We had a really good time out, but he missed the train home so I said he could stay at my house as I live in the city (I live with my partner (23m) of five years.)

When we got back my partner wasn't there, so we were chatting waiting for him to come home but he never did. 

I can't really remember how it happened, but my coworker started saying to me that he thought I was really beautiful, intelligent and funny and that we have a connection, he proceeded to start holding my hand. I told him it's not okay, and to think about his wife (who I know). He hugged me, saying he wanted to make sure I was okay, but i didn't feel comfortable with it as it was a bit too long and felt like he was trying to make a move. Anyway he continued to speak about how he has feelings for me etc, getting a little too close for comfort. In hindsight I should have just told him to leave but I had had a few too many drinks.

Anyway we slept in separate beds and when I woke up he had already left.

At work things have been really awkward as we work very closely. We have emailed about it a few times where he again stated that he thinks something draws us together, and that if he is being honest, he likes me, and did want to kiss me and that he doesn't regret that evening. 

We do not have HR at my our office so I have nobody to turn to for advice. 

I spoke to a friend who said I should meet up with him after work for a coffee to clear the air, he agreed to meet me this evening. Is this a good idea?

t2_1e2zzofu,1553790294.0,b6kvrv,t3_b6kvrv,4,"So I’ve been dating her for a year now and I started dating her when I had major sleep issues so I kinda took the first girl that had interest in me because okay cool whatever. We met on a dating app and it’s always been long distance (45 minutes usually) and for the first few months it was awesome!

But as I’ve caught up on sleep I realize that she’s a very obnoxious and dramatic person. She’s a great girlfriend and means well with core values but we have different life plans ahead of us.

She wants to move to DC (USA) and work as a director somewhere while I want to remain close to home by my family in the northeast. I am highly functioning autistic so I need to further my seasonal special interests otherwise I go crazy.

She wasn’t like that to start and away from each other we seem fine but once I go to her house (which is every weekend) I feel like we always get into it. She’s a very stubborn person who comes off harshly and I’m laid back and just do my thing so when I’m around her I escalate into her and we get into it. I don’t feel like myself around her and feel very guarded because of her strong personality. She’s loud and dramatic and all that.

It’s an every weekend thing too. We never did this before and I’m wondering if it’s because she’s more comfortable around me or whatever it is.

But she’s the type of person that is so career and life oriented that you can’t even help her with anything because she has it “figured out.” Meanwhile she’s always on my case about what I do and it comes off as more of a mother thing than a girlfriend. We are supposed to co-exist and it doesn’t feel like we are compatible in the slightest anymore.

Is this all in my head? Maybe we just are a little too opposite for one another? Because nobody else says what she says I do (about being difficult or high maintenance) so I’m thinking it’s not me and it’s her.

I just need help explaining. Sorry if I left out details that’s really the gist of it. I feel this wall between us when I’m with her and while we’ve had some good moments I just don’t think we click. And I date for the long run so if she wants me to move with her or do this and that then I don’t know. I like being close to family and I just feel like I’m wasting my time.

And I’ve read articles affirming my incompatibility theory which probably doesn’t help but still. 

She’s a very dominant person and (this is gonna sound stupid but I’ll say it anyways) I feel a little powerless not being the primary support system. I as a guy feel like my girlfriend should always be able to come to me for help and she NEVER does that. She’s so independent and driven that she can do no wrong and it’s always me who needs improving. 

I grew up in a family where that was the case with men so excuse my traditional way of thinking but I truly enjoy being a means of support. And it goes both ways. 

Be honest with me please, am I being ridiculous or are we too different from each other?

Now I'm in college but one 2.5 hours from his. For a year it was good. After that, it's like we've been fighting even more and more. Our conversations are through messaging through out the day and rarely videochat. My roommate says our arguments are about the weirdest things. (For example, he doesn't like when I correct his grammar, but he knows I can't help it because I'm K-6 major. I want him to do better and not have him be embarrassed for simple mistakes in his career.) These fights we have are long drawn out. We will argue, stop talking, keep being mad for a day, solve/not solve, we will be okay for a few days, and repeat. Anyways, I've always thought we've been good together when we are actually with each other in person. We see each other for a few days about every two months. Though these fights really get to me sometimes. It causes a lot more conflict when we should both be trying to finish bachelor's. There's so much stress. I need advice, but prefer advice other long-distance couples. Are fights like this normal? Should we just break-up? We've talked about ""should we break up"" but never do because our lives have been so connected for so long. This is my first relationship.

TL;DR Bf and I are in long-distance and fighting is common, we converse through texts. Advise?

Edit: The grammar correcting is not a day lasting argument. When it rarely has happened, it has been fairly short arguments. I did not want to bring up any other examples.

I'm a married man for 6 years with my wife (37F) and our young daughter. 6 very hard years with more downs than ups, last year being the hardest of them all. I still love my wife but due to the length of time that it hasn't been working out I felt I was on the brink of moving on. We had reached a point where even the fights had stopped cos we both had given up on finding common grounds. Out of loneliness I ended up talking about my situation with a female friend of mine. Let's call her M.

&amp;#x200B;

I've known this woman for a very long time and I've always felt some form of attraction to her but I've never acted on it. In the same way that I've never made an attempt to be too friendly with any other woman for as long as I've been with my wife.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't approach her with the intention to look for a new partner. It just happened that the conversation started and it kept going and going and I ended up spending a lot of time talking to her. She also opened up to me about how her marriage had recently gone through similarly very difficult times but they were now back on better terms and that she loved him once again after having spent a period of time hating him.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of our conversations I couldn't help but notice how her husband's weaknesses were my strengths and how my wife's weaknesses were her strengths, and the more time I spent with her I started seeing us as a perfect match.

At this point the cocktail of emotions that started building up inside me were something I've never experienced before. I was in love with 2 women at the same time. In my mind, my wife had the advantage of having a long history with me and also our daughter, but the disadvantage of all the baggage that our bumpy relationship brings with it. M, had the advantage of being ""new"" and exciting and that I felt we were more compatible, but the disadvantage that I knew deep inside it wasn't meant to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

She never led me on to think that there's a chance of something happening between us, she had a lot of time available to her simply due to having different working hours than her husband's, and I didn't feel I was able to control how I felt for her.

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime I've managed to convince my wife to seek professional help (thanks to M's advice) about her mental/hormonal health (I won't go into details). So at this point I'm seeing the possibility that my marriage can eventually (maybe/hopefully) get back on it's feet. This isn't something my wife will be able to do on her own though, she needs my full support which up till yesterday wasn't something I was able to provide, because emotionally I was split between 2 women.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand I felt like I was being a hypocrite with M for having these strong feelings for her while she's telling me about her marriage issues. I had a conflict of interest.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning my cocktail of emotions had reached the point where it was driving me crazy so I came to the conclusion that there's only 1 way out of this. I had to tell M the whole truth, knowing from beforehand that I was going to get rejected. I had to somehow find the inner strength to do this or else I was going to get stuck in a spiral. Sending a message is much easier than talking to a person face to face so I messaged her just to let her know there was something I haven't been telling her and that I need to tell her face to face. At this point there was no turning back. We met, and I told her.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; M, I'm in love with 2 women... and you are one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

There was an immediate feeling of guilt on her end and I reassured her that there was no need for that. I told her that I was doing this because I believe she had the right to know, and that it made me feel better now that I finally let it out. Even though there was no need of saying it she reiterated that she's in love with her husband and she couldn't reciprocate how I felt for her and she told me that I will need to learn to control this emotion.

&amp;#x200B;

Later on i picked my wife from work and gave her a big hug just to let her know that I'm there for her. I don't know if it will work out or not in the end, but I will try to keep this relationship from falling apart 1 more time.

&amp;#x200B;

I never would have thought that one day I was going tell another woman that I loved her to help my relationship with my wife.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is also my way of getting some closure.

But it's clearly stuck with her. 
Now with the menopause her body is naturally changing. Her waist is disappearing, her skin is losing its elasticity and so she's aging, and it's all because her hormones are stopping.

I still feel that way but its getting easier to convince myself I'm being crazy and to let it go, so I no longer verbalize my worries to him and he's happy to see that I'm sure. 

About a month ago I was laying on the couch at his place trying to get rid of my headache. He was sitting on the couch on my phone, (he is on it quite often and I don't mind as I have nothing to hide, my phone is his phone same with the other way around) his phone was sitting next to him so I took his and went to his Reddit page (hoping he doesn't see this) about a minute later, if that, he takes his phone back and walks off saying he needs to, ""look something up."" I personally called BS on this but didn't say anything. 

2 weeks ago, he got an innocent text from his female coworker, of course I didn't care, he's allowed to have female friends and it's not like I saw anything 'fishy' anyway and if I did I would say something, he simply cleared the message as he was with me and didn't feel a need to reply at that moment.

Yesterday, I was with him and he left his phone in the room so... I know I shouldn't do it, but I picked up his phone to see exactly how regularly they talked, sure enough, there was a message from her that he had cleared from him notifications and it sat in his messages unopened. I wished I would've opened it myself to see if he was talking about anything out of the ordinary. 

I want to talk to him about it, but I don't want him to think I'm simply over thinking again and that I haven't totally, ""recovered"" I guess you could say. I never thought about him cheating on me though. This is a first. Although I feel he wouldn't do it for sexual reasons, I feel he might fall for someone other than me... What do I do? I don't want him to be afraid of telling me things because of how anxious I am.

t2_61np6,1553787845.0,b6kdj1,t3_b6kdj1,3,"Hey, thanks for clicking, I could use some anonymous advice. I'm a 20 year old college student. I major in jazz drum set, and music takes up a lot of my time. I play in a band, 2 school jazz ensembles, host a radio show, write and record my own music, and take classes. On top of this, I also work two nights a week part-time. On a usual weeknight this semester, the earliest I will get home is at around 9:30. I'm very busy with a mix of classes, rehearsals, and gigs.

I met my girlfriend, let's call her ""Sabrina,"" on Tinder a month ago. We went out to eat, back to my house, and made out. The night after, she came to see me perform. She then went away for a few days, but came back to a fun night, and we officially became boyfriend and girlfriend. We almost immediately laid out what we wanted in a relationship, and we both agreed that casual wasn't our thing, and we were looking for something meaningful and long-term. I was really happy. I'd felt that I'd finally found the girl I had been looking for.

I have a complicated past with relationships.

I've had seven girlfriends and many more flings. Each relationship has not lasted very long, the longest being nine months in high school, but we had broken up then gotten back together. I have never made it to four months without splitting up, and I'm definitely realizing that I'm the common thread. My last girlfriend had Borderline Personality Disorder, and once we split, I felt like I had been manipulated into dating her. I've had a consistent streak of dating ""crazy"" (according to my mom) girls. I think I have some sort of commitment or self-sabotage issues. I'll get the relationship that I want, and then after a short amount of time, my mind will convince myself that I don't want it anymore, yet I still constantly seek out a relationship. It's frustrating. Two days ago, I was in a bad mood, worried about an exam, a rehearsal, etc. and she was worried about me, so she saw me during her break. I was really in my head, and I laid everything out for her. I have to be honest with her. I told her that I am scared of a long-term relationship, that I've been damaged by previous girlfriends that I've had, and that I often tend to see being single as a sort of comfort zone. She took it well, and comforted me, saying that it's okay and holding my hand. I went to rehearsal, then called her after (once I was feeling better) and apologized. She said I have nothing to apologize for.

Last night, she actually met my father for the first time. He visited up from my home state, and took us out to dinner. It was a really fun time, my dad likes her, and we all laughed a lot. I was feeling good. We came back to my house, turned on Lord of the Rings, and had sex. It was good, but after we'd finished, the thoughts came pouring back in my mind again. She noticed and asked if I was okay. I shook my head no, then we talked about it. I reiterated to her that I'm scared of hurting her. I told her that I think I have the tendency to sabotage myself once I get what I want. She asked if she needed to be worried about me hurting her, and I hesitated for a long time before saying no. She said that she too has been through a lot of bad things and was scared of being alone. She then said that if she were to go back to ""that place,"" that she doesn't know what she would do, and I saw a tear fall from her eye. She was in a messed up relationship for a year and a half (She was 15, he was in college, and took advantage of her). We woke up together this morning, then I drove her to campus.

Sabrina is a girl that I'm happy to be dating. She meets the high expectations that I've set for a partner, she's insanely supportive, funny, smart, talented, and I find her attractive. I, however, am swamped with responsibilities, I have a consistent marijuana habit and she doesn't smoke, and I'm worried that a long-term relationship with her will take up time that I don't really have. Plus, there are four to six weeks left in the semester, then I go back home, three hours away from her, to work two jobs over the Summer and only see her a few times. I don't know if a long-term relationship, despite being what I've wanted (and still want!) for a long time would be beneficial for me.

I'd really appreciate any response you might have.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I have a girlfriend that I enjoy being with, she supports me, and I'm proud that she's my girlfriend. I also, however, have a truckload of responsibilities, commitment issues, and a Summer break coming up. We've both said that we wanted a long-term relationship, but I don't know if I'm able to handle that right now. I don't want to hurt her, she'll be heartbroken if we break up.

I have mentioned how I am thinking about switching to another field. My parents seem to think I will never amount to anything. They seem pessimistic that I will ever succeed and think I will just end up with a minimum wage job. They seem to be doubting my ability to do any job well as they think I can't even do simple things such as checking my emails, not procrastinating, and keeping my room organised.

However ,I've noticed from like around Christmas time that he keeps asking me to buy him things. The first few times he said it i actually thought he was playing because he said it so bold , almost commanding me...in a nice way. Then times after that it would be so weird, because he would say it out of nowhere, like ""oh your in that store... buy me this and that"" ... wth . I'm not a cheap person but I am a bit selfish, and frankly I don't appreciate people telling when or what to buy , whatever I buy should be my decision and on my own time. 

He always wants me to buy him some new video game or clothes. He will show me some game or TV or console on Amazon. He even wants shirts or shoes from Nike or Adidas. 

BTW , we have never bought each other anything, expect for Christmas , but it's mainly because I'm generally uncomfortable with people buying me things unless its like the holidays. ADDITIONALLY, he works , and I dont. His family has a pretty decent amount of money and as I just mentioned HE WORKS, i mean if you want something that bad , how about YOU buy it, he has the money to do so. I dont go to school now because of my busy schedule and im a paid intern at a company . Currently i pay off for everything with inheritance money, and im pretty spoiled so my parents too.

I dropped out, worked for a year, and am now in my second year of university training to become a teacher. I love my classes. I have a car. I live with my family rent free. Pretty sweet right? 
Around Christmas I started...slipping. Feeling depressed all the time, suicidal sometimes, and it showed up in my work. I stopped going to pretty much every class. I'm taking five courses (a full course load) and four of the courses I'm doing well in because I can hand in assignments online, but this other course I need I am failing because I need to hand in assignments in person and everything is based on the in class lecture. Just a couple weeks ago I opened up to my doctor and now I'm on an antidepressant (which I don't think is doing anything) and am trying to start going to therapy (but my university's insurance is making it a bit hard). 

Because I'm going to fail this course and it's a prerequisite for a few other courses, I will have to retake the course. I talked with the prof and there's not anything I can do to make this up and just pass. I talked with my student advisor and that's pretty much what I can do. This will extend my degree by a whole year since this class is only offered in the winter semester. 

I have no clue what to tell people around me. The only one that knows is my sister. It's probably important to note that I am paying for my schooling through loans and scholarships, but my parents are pretty nosy and will be extremely disappointed if I tell them the truth.

So last week my (now ex) boyfriend decided to end our long distance relationship because of my plans to live in another country for 6 months come this fall. 

We dated normally for about 8 months and then had switched to long distance for the last 4, but we are only about 5 hours apart and in the same time zone. Things were going pretty well and we visited each other as much as we could, but the looming obstacle of a 9 hour time difference and upcoming responsibilities in each of our lives caused him to seriously doubt his ability to be there for me emotionally and maintain a deep connection. I wasn’t super thrilled about ending things, as I had been really happy in the relationship and we communicated a lot, we were functioning well with distance etc. but at the end of the day I understood that it was probably for the best and we decided to remain close and reevaluate upon my return next year. It was a very amicable and well discussed break-up so I wasn’t too distraught but still fairly disappointed.  

Well, some unexpected life events happened and I’m now unable to leave in a few months like I originally planned, and will likely be staying where I’m at for at least the next few years. 

Now I’m torn, because I am still very much into the idea of starting our relationship up again and last time we talked he explicitly said me leaving was the one thing stopping him from being willing to put in the effort right now. He was worried about me overextending myself trying to hold up a relationship he was apprehensive about since an inevitable break was looming. The one thing he couldn’t get past is no longer an issue, but how do I tell him that without making it seem like I’m doing the exact thing he didn’t want me to do and overcommitting to a relationship, when the decision had nothing to do with him ? 

I am going to see him in person next month so should I wait till then? Or try and talk to him before to see where we stand now that things have shifted around ?

I always knew that sex was really important to him. He has always had a really high sex drive which I have always easily kept up with and satisfied both together and apart. We've always been open to each other about porn, which I've never had a problem with in past relationships, or this one. Why would I if I watch it too?  We have watched it together and we have shared it while we were apart. 

​

For this past winter break I spent at his apartment. We had no problems between us, although he was stressed about his last semester of college coming up as well as waiting to hear back from a job offer. It was the night before my flight that was the following morning. He was going to shower, and normally right after we would have an extended time for foreplay and sex since I would be leaving tomorrow. Especially since we hadn't had sex for the past couple days. While he was showering, I started our laundry and cleaning our dishes that were around the apartment. Went to use the bathroom, but he had locked it. Which he had never ever done. He said ""oh, sorry!"" &amp; I heard him shuffle around and then unlock the door. I opened it and he had only just jumped in the shower, even though almost 10 minutes had gone by with the shower on. He also wasn't playing music from his phone which he always does. It was obvious he was watching porn and masturbating. It made me really uncomfortable, confused, and insecure immediately, but neither of us said anything about it which I really regret now. But the night went on and no sex happened. He was very overly sweet to me after that too, like he knew what he did was wrong and I was bothered by it. I really regret not confronting the situation in that moment but oh well.

​

I go home and the following weeks consisted of very little ""sexy time"" between us, whereas there would usually be a lot. I kept commenting on it and he just said he was stressed. But he's also told me that sex stuff relieves his stress a lot, so I just assume he's watching porn all the time instead of incorporating it between us like usual. I finally confronted him about what happened that one night and how it hurt me a lot, because it was the last night I was there and I didn't understand why he chose to do that. It was really hard for him to talk about, as it is an awkward topic, so it took like two days to fully get everything out of him about it. I felt bad but it made me really insecure, since I do so much for him sexually all the time. He confessed he does have a porn addiction, and it's how he copes with stress. He sees it as one of the healthier addictions to have, since it's not harmful. He told me about how he would just stay home and play video games that he can AFK and just watch porn on the side. He would watch it for hours and do it several times a day. He said he stopped at the beginning of our relationship for me (never told me this, he wanted to do this himself), but when we had a rough patch about a year ago he started up again. He told me he knows he needs to stop, and he knows that it hurt me, and he apologized. He told me that he would stop watching porn completely for me, and that instead we would increase our ""sexy times"" to help him relax. That meant a lot...but it didn't happen.

​

Now, two months later, I'm an anxious and insecure mess because anything sexual between us has withered away substantially. He doesn't ask for pictures anymore, he doesn't want to sext anymore, and anytime we have our ""sexy times"" is when I bring it up and he doesn't seem to really enjoy it like he used to. Now I'm constantly paranoid about not being enough or not being attractive. I'm paranoid when we hang up at night because he's probably just watching porn. I'm paranoid about how many times he's been doing that when I was with him instead of including me. since we don't get to be together very often. I understand that masturbation/porn is its own thing, but the amount of times I satisfy him is way more than how much he satisfies me, and that's one of the big problems. Recently I broke down in front of him about how insecure it has made me ever since I walked in on him, and he reassures me that it'll be okay, and that I have nothing to worry about. He says that now he just jerks off without porn, but he's told me before that he's not able to do that (""bad imagination""), so I don't believe him.

​

I don't know if I'm forgetting anything, and wow this was longer than I thought. Please help me through my thoughts on this. We're planning on him moving to my state after he graduates in a month, but I honestly don't want to live with this constant paranoia. And no, I don't watch porn anymore. I can't. I just see the women on there as women that he's watching and it makes me compare myself to them, adding to the insecurities.

​

**TL;DR:** After walking in on my long-distance boyfriend watching porn the night before I left to fly back home, I realized that he's had a porn addiction. He told me he would stop but has not offered any evidence or reassurance about it. It's made me incredibly paranoid and insecure. I want him to stop watching it completely now, even though I used to be okay with it. Do we need to properly address this together? Or, if I'm overreacting, how can I get over my insecurities and paranoia about it?",relationships,How should I (20F) address my boyfriend (21M) watching porn?
t2_cn0xw,1553786181.0,b6k16y,t3_b6k16y,5,"I (28M) have lost trust for my gf (24F).  Our relationship was magic for the first 6 months until recently.  Friends before our relationship for a year and I fell in love incredibly fast.  Fully trusted her, was incredibly confident at the start, and I am a damn good man.  She is a great girl and we have immense potential.

We are both in professional school together and have very bright futures.  We are having issues right now (that I will admit I caused at this point).  The issues stem from two things:

1) My trust for her was broken due to inappropriate interactions with another colleague of ours who always makes sexual comments to her and is always going out of his way to playfully touch/joke with her directly in front of me.  She no longer reciprocates the flirting, but she did at first and I feel betrayed.  It has pissed me off on multiple occasions and everytime I see him I get pissed off and lose my loving feelings for her.  I told her about this and she made the initiative to stop it, but he continues to do things that cause massive issues (for me) in our relationship.  It has been affecting my sleep, my happiness, and my focus.

2) For the relationship to function, I would have to sacrifice some of my career goals.  She would not necessarily have to do the same.  I am becoming concerned about whether or not it is worth it because the risk is becoming very apparent to me.  I am having trouble focusing and I am not having my needs met lately.


I just today told her about the trust issues I am having.   She has been very respectful since the initial incident, but this guy is a creep and won't fuck off.  I have now said something about this guy 3 times.  The worst part is, I fully consider myself ""better"" than this guy, and I am extremely fed up of dealing with it.

My now problem, I just left her apartment because I cannot sleep because of the perceived rift in the relationship.  She is upset and so am I.  I feel like the only option is to end the relationship although I am very much in love with this girl.  My heart is breaking as I write this and I really just want some outside perspective.  I want ""us"" back, but I am concerned that our recent problems have made it to a ""point of no return"".  I want some outside perspective.

TL:DR - I (28M) have lost trust for my gf (24F) and I don't want to break up, but my trust issues are triggered by another guy that has disrespected our relationship and cannot possibly be removed from the equation due to work.  I could really use some perspective.",relationships,I (28M) have lost trust for my gf (24F).

Obviously distraught, I reached out to a friend of mine whose only response has been, “I’m sorry to hear that” or “I’m sorry you’re not feeling well.” Maybe I’m wrong, but when your friend of nearly 15 years tells you there’s a significant chance that they won’t live to see the end of this year, wouldn’t you ask questions? Be concerned? Tell them you love them or respond in kind when they say it to you? 

Under no circumstances do I want a pity party or expect this person to drop their life and cater to me. It just that they don’t care. In my mind, “I’m sorry you don’t feel well” is what you say to someone with a head cold, not malignant tumors. What’s even more odd is that until I told them about the recurrence six months ago, everything was great. But once I did, every response I’ve gotten has been very curt (for lack of better wording) or just extremely out of character.

I’m not sure what I should do here. Am I overreacting? Should I confront this friend?

t2_3eyws27d,1553785395.0,b6jv83,t3_b6jv83,4,"My boyfriend and I of 1 year &amp; 3 months decided to take a break , mutually a week ago. The relationship was beginning to go downhill really fast after he told me that he basically was “ young &amp; hasn’t experienced anything fr yet and is scared of what life has for him and for the both of us “ .. After he said this , we broke up for like .. a day but he ended up apologizing , saying that he didn’t need to experience life , he has all he needs. Sweet right? Well then, in this support group chat for army wives and girlfriends , there began an expose session of some of the husbands and A LOT of them had cheated during AIT and within their first year at their duty station .. My boyfriend had been emotionally shut off with everyone since he got in training and of course . I tried to maintain the relationship, putting in 90% while he of course was putting in 10.. I felt myself starting to build up resentment , we began arguing all of the time , barely wanted to speak to one another ( on his end more so ) and I’d tell him what I wanted out of this relationship and he basically would tell me he couldn’t be that man for me .. At least for right now , his focus has shifted towards his career and he wants stability before making any long term decisions . We had definitely discussed marriage and stuff before , multiple times, enthusiastically . But about a week ago I brought up his desire to “ experience “ and we both came to an agreement that we need a break . A breather . I even accepted the fact that he’ll flirt with other girls , probably even sleep with them too because thats what his friends are doing .. And he’s a young man in the army who is around a bunch of people..I’m not delusional. He may be one of the nicer guys out of the bunch BUT he is still a young MAN.. I just told him I want him to be able to marry me without the need to go and experience someone else during the marriage .. I don’t want to worry about cheating . He says he’s just focused on graduating and trying to get his shit together , he isn’t really thinking about girls like that .

Now , here is the bad part .. A guy friend who I ideally had no kind of sexual or deep emotional feelings for came in the picture in December . We would talk , I’d go and get him sometimes and take him to get a rello or some pods for his JUUL , little shit like that . Nothing ever really serious and he had just gotten cheated on and left for a dude in the Navy (ironic huh?). He was pretty down about it, smokes his depression away all of the time .. But I was being a friend . We’d talk and everything . After my boyfriend and I broke up , I went over and talked to him about it . Asked him what he thought you know ? My friend had been there emotionally for me the entire time while my boyfriend was being neglectful . He started to say things like “ you deserve better , you’re so beautiful “ .. My boyfriend made me feel like he had gotten tired of me ... I felt unwanted by him and wanted by this guy in a short frame of time ... Things got intense extremely fast . No this was NOT planned at all ... It isn’t what I wanted , This all happened a week while me and my boyfriend had broken up . It was like .. emotional healing for the both of us .. At least in my head because although the barrier for emotional safety between my boyfriend and I had been broken , leaving space for feelings to grow for other parties had successfully been filled , I still didn’t see a future with this guy . I saw maybe a short term rebound kind of deal . After this hookup happened , he looked at me and said that “ we shouldn’t be doing this “ I agreed and began to cry .. Had a whole break down .. I felt bad afterwards because I was only doing this to fill a void, I knew that .. Even though I do have love for the guy and he said he loves me and doesn’t want either of us to feel used and he eventually wants to be together . We’ve known each other for roughly 3 years , but I am sure this is just infatuation ... We had a fling back in high school but he ended up choosing someone else over me, which he regrets now because its the ex that he was cheated on by. He looks at me like he admires me and he is so attentive .. He gets high all of the time which is probably why he is so sweet half of the time .. I don’t know , I’m pretty sure we both know we’ve crossed a boundary that wasn’t meant to be crossed .. At least for right now . My (ex)boyfriend and I talked last night , he basically says he is enjoying the break ... He is trying to get this training shit out of the way and everything ... I asked has he experienced things yet and he said no he hasn’t ... Doesn’t plan to but I’m asking questions he hasn’t really gotten confronted by yet . Anyways... I mentally decided to not have sex with this guy anymore . For what ? It made me feel awful ... I love my ex .. He told me he has the desire to come back &amp; plans on it .. in a month or so . Possibly . We said no longer than 2 . I just want him to be sure . Question is , should I disclose my hookup with this guy to him ? He said he doesn’t know if he’d be hurt or not if I did something like this because he hasn’t really thought that far ahead but I KNOW he’ll be hurt . Truth is , I’d never think to do something like this if I felt wanted by him . I’ve been faithful to him my entire relationship and only longed for the same emotional support I was giving to him .

*Skip to the end for a brief TLDR, but if you’re curious keep reading*

I’ve had anxiety ever since I was 9 years old, and that ranged from panic attacks, social anxiety, phobias, obsessive compulsive thinking, depersonalization and agoraphobia (fear of public places). 

I often feel like people don’t understand the severity of my anxiety because it’s also a basic descriptor of emotion that everyone feels from time to time, but my anxiety took me out of school for three years, hospitalized me for a year and I’ve been seeing mental health professionals for 10 years now! I was on medication for ten years until a month ago now (Horray) when I finally decided it was time to do it on my own. 

BUT THIS ISN’T MEANT TO BE A MENTAL HEALTH POST 

This post is about my romantic relationship and how my mental health is/has effected it.

If my anxiety problems were 9/10 growing up I would say they sit at about a 3/10 now with occasional 6/10 flare ups. 

My boyfriend works in the trades while I’m a student (works retail in summers); we don’t live together and we hangout probably 3-4 times a week! He’s super social, creative, hard working and kind. But he also is an extremely empathetic person meaning * he is very susceptible to my emotions. *

And here I am, aware of how much he loves me, and how much of an empath he is, continuing to be negative about my mental health recovery. This is why I am a horrible girlfriend.

I can tell sometimes that when I mention I’m particularly anxious, or sensitive, his face sinks a little and he doesn’t seem to enjoy our time together as much. He sometimes gets upset for his own reasons but I truly believe at these times it’s my fault he gets upset.

Recently I found out he’s been keeping things from me like how he’s feeling on a given day, or what he needs (sex, his mood, space, distraction, etc.). He says sometimes he just doesn’t want to make me more anxious or more sad. And it really scared me that he’s been distant with me and so I started hiding that I was upset, so he wouldn’t be upset on my behalf. This just made me feel more compressed, and I felt like I had no one to talk to.

Speaking of talking to people— here’s my support system situation: my mom, my boyfriend and about three other close friends. Unfortunately my closest friends are also students and we all only really hangout when we do study seshes at the library so we don’t talk about our feelings a lot. I am currently seeing a therapist every two weeks. 

TLDR:
My boyfriend is the sun, and I am like a black hole sucking the life out of him because I still have decently bad anxiety. What do we (I) have to do to make this relationship work, I love him so much and I hate that my pain becomes his pain so easily— is that normal? Am I too negative to be in a relationship?

I'm in a strange predicament where I don't know how to go about it. There is this girl that I've known for about ten years now we are both 27 (I'm a dude btw). She lives out of state as well. Over these past ten years we've gone through a lot of ups and downs and helped each other out constantly. We each considered ourselves each other best friends similar interests and what not and talk almost every day. She has been through A LOT like traumatic stuff with past relationships. Anyways a few months ago I confessed straight out in a novel of a text wall (after a few drinks) how I feel about her and everything just spilled out on the page so to speak. I knew probably the response I was going to get that she didn't want to invest a relationship with anyone and just focus on herself right now. Which I understand and I'm okay with honestly. At the same time I constantly think about her and what could be. She's a really independent woman has a plan in life, goals and shes gorgeous. I'm just a dude that just coastin' by still trying to figure things out and I'm a bigger dude thats okay looking. Even if she was looking for someone I feel like as much as I want it I wouldn't be right for her ya know? I always think about trying to explore and to try and date again (it's been 3-4 years since I went on a date last) but I feel like even if I did find someone that would date all I would think about is her. One I feel like I'm robbing myself for happiness or two even if she was looking I feel like I wouldn't be the one she would be looking for. So I'm lost and just wanted to vent out about it.

ackground: for a year and a half I dated a guy on and off who of course, initially seemed great, but would randomly leave me, cheat on me, talk to his exes, degrade me, mock me, insult me, and constantly neg me until I began to believe I couldn’t do better. Around him, I constantly felt insecure, unsafe, unloved, and like I was never good enough for anything.

It’s been about a year since things ended for good between us. Recently, (a bit over a month ago) I met a guy. So far, he’s great. He makes time for me, doesn’t spend all his time at the bar, he is very family oriented, gives me advice and motivation when I need it, takes genuine interest in me and makes me feel good about myself.

We started off seeing each other constantly...I told him we should pump the brakes and relax a bit, focus on dating, have less sleep overs. He agreed. Nonetheless, we didn’t see each other for a few days and since then he’s wanted to hang out three times and we have and we had fun.

Despite my hurt and issues with trust, I do initiate a lot, I’m very kind and willing to put myself out there. However, all these little things make me doubt his true feelings for me.

For one, his family came to town for a weekend; he didn’t tell his mom about me and went so far as to tell me not to talk when she called, but apologized saying he hasn’t gotten around to telling her yet. To be fair, I haven’t exactly been telling everyone either, but still- it’s just how it makes me feel.

Secondly, we agreed on being sexually and romantically exclusive (he actually brought up the romantic part) so I deleted my tinder but I noticed he didn’t. I brought it up and he said he has, but left it at that. I don’t trust it.

Thirdly, he plays adult softball. I said I wanted to go to a game but he didn’t invite me to any of them. And yeah, it’s a co-Ed team.

All of this just makes me go, why not stay on tinder? Why close myself off? Why commit? Am I crazy?

Lilly is the kind of 'friend' that likes to be around people that are popular/ make her feel popular, and would mostly text me when she was having problems again or was feeling sad. I can understand that you will occasionally feel bad or have problems with your parents etc., hell I probably have a medal in complaining by this point, but to just text me for that or to hear about how amazing your new poem is, is just pretty shitty, and wasn't exactly a great feeling. So whenever she texted me I would already be annoyed.

We were in classes together, but my best friend and another friend, friend 1, were in a different one, so I had to deal with her the most, and she didn't really spend any time with them anymore except when she happened to see them. Though more with friend 1 because we had a joined math class, best friend had a different kind of maths.

For some added context, these particular texts happened when I was spending time with my best friend to celebrate her birthday. Now let's get into these dramatic texts.

Lilly: OP, happy easter. (First text she sended me that day, this is important later.)

Me: Thanks, happy easter.

Lilly: I am happy on my own so here I'll stay, save your loving arms for a rainy day, and I'll find my comfort in my pain. (note, I have absolutely no idea why she said this.)

Lilly: Thank you, can I ask you a weird question?

Me: I'm with other people right now.

Lilly: It is an easy question but I will ask it another time.

Lilly: This is so weird, I still fit in my dresses from five years ago.

Me: I sure as hell wouldn't be able to either.

Lilly: I thought I wasn't going to fit in that dress either.

Lilly: Still visiting?

Me: Yes

Lilly: Family?

Me: No the friend that wishes you a happy easter too. (My best friend who hadn't gotten a text from her.)

Lilly: (Best friend)?!

Lilly: Can I ask your opinion about a dress?

Lilly: It is a funny colour.

Lilly: Can you wish that friend a happy easter?!

Me: She said (middle finger emoji).

Lilly: (sad/hurt emojis.)

Lilly: But can I?

Me: sure.

Lilly: (proceeds to send pictures of her in a dress that was pretty tight, definitely not fitting her like a nice fitting dress should.)

Me: meh.

Me: The colour isn't funny, it's just mint.

Lilly: (more sad/ emojis)

Lilly: I really like it.

Me: Okay.

Lilly: Your opinion is really important, what don't you like about it?

Me: Idk.

Lilly: The colour? The shape? The fact that it's a dress? The person that's wearing it? (Attention seeking alert.)

Me: Idk.

Lilly: (even more sad/ hurt emojis)

Lilly: Your opinion is really important.

Me: Okay.

Lilly: Mind looking at another?

Me, just wanting this to end so I can stop texting her: Okay.

Lilly: (sends a picture of another dress that didn't fit her properly)

Me: Does not fit.

Lilly: I can put straps on it.

Lilly: It does fit.

Me: No, there is fit, and there is fit, you fit in it but your body does not fit the proportions. (Five years ago at that moment we were all about eleven or twelve, we at least grew a little in height, and grew in our hips, chest, and thighs, her not fitting into it shouldn't have been such a big deal because it is completely normal.)

Lilly: OP stop.

Me: You asked for my opinion?

Lilly: Yes I did.

Me: Then?

Lilly: (sends another picture of her in the dress, now with the straps.)

Me: Still does not fit.

Lilly: You are the only one saying that.

Me: Maybe I'm the only one being honest.

Me: You asked for my opinion don't get mad at me for giving it.

Lilly: Not nice.

Lilly: I could ask a boy.

Me: then ask a boy.

Lilly: (I assume she was referring to the being honest here) It can't be because he loves me so he would look nice no matter what. (I don't know either what her point was.)

Lilly: I already asked my dad and he said yes.

Me: Look, it's my opinion, if you don't like it because it's negative and honest don't ask for it.

Lilly: No!

Lilly: Why doesn't it fit? Because I am too chubby?

Me: Girl you ain't chubby.

Lilly: I am.

Me: (a bunch of annoyed emojis.)

Lilly: I am really.

Me: No, I am chubby.

Lilly: Yes.

Me: And I fucking love being chubby so don't go saying being chubby is bad. (Weight used to be/ is an issue for me, so this subject was a little bit sensitive.)

Lilly: I didn't say it was bad.

Me: And it doesn't fit because, I don't know if you know this, but your body gets wider and fuller when you grow up because it is biologically getting ready for child bearing.

Me: And you literally did.

Lilly: Perhaps you are wrong.

Me: Then don't ask for my opinion.

Lilly: Okay, then I won't.

Lilly: I will stop writing.

Me: Okay.

Lilly: Because I won't need your help anymore.

Me: K.

Lilly: That is freaking rude.

Me: Idc.

Lilly: Did you ever?

Me: I've seriously tried to support you as much as I fucking could so don't give me this cryptic shit because there is only so much I can take before I am done.

Lilly: Go ahead, fire away, you guys are all the same.

Me: seriously.

Lilly: Yes, for a brief moment I thought you were more like me.

Me: It's time to stop blaming others and start looking at your own faults.

Lilly: Haha.

Me: seriously.

Lilly: Bye.

Me: Yeah bye.

Me: Just leave me.

Me: Like you did to a bunch of other people.

Lilly: You don't have any right to judge me I never did with you.

Me: I'm not fucking judging you. (Maybe I was a little, but I was upset and annoyed and didn't really care much, she had crossed a line with me.)

Lilly: You are.

Lilly: You judge me just because I walked away but you don't know what happened.

Me: You literally left (best friend) and kinda (friend 1) and (friend 2) (a friend that was in our class).

Me: Want me to judge you?

Me: Fine.

Lilly: I didn't, I never left them.

Me: You use people as long as they are use-full and convenient to you and then drop them.

Lilly: I don't.

Me: Yeah, you do.

Lilly: You perhaps but not me.

Me: Are you fucking kidding me! When?!

Lilly: You are twisting my words.

Me: How the fuck am I twisting your words?

Lilly: You said you wanted... car.... without.... caring.... leaving... behind....

Me: What?!

Lilly: Forgot?

Me: I have no fucking clue what you are talking about.

Lilly: Remember when I wanted to walk away.

Me: I was literally worried out of my mind and going crazy and all you did was laugh. (She hadn't even walked away, her definition of walking away was going on a walk through her town, and her laughing did not sound nervous at all.)

Lilly: Those were nerves and you know that.

Me: sure.

Lilly: I called you.

Lilly: You said you... car... sad.... not caring.... who was left behind.

Me: I never did that.

Me: You say that I am twisting your words but you are twisting mine.

Lilly: I am not I remember that loud and clear.

Me: Good for you.

Me: I thought you were leaving.

Lilly: I didn't leave (best friend) and (friend 1), I still talk to them.

Lilly: And (friend 2) you haven't got a clue what is going on.

Lilly: So before judging you could have at least asked for my side of the story.

Me: This coming from (best friend), she does think you left her.

Lilly: Well I didn't and she could talk to me herself.

Lilly: Just because she thinks I did doesn't have to mean I did.

Lilly: I talked to (best friend) a few days ago I asked her where she was so we could sit together but she had already left.

Me: Because it was convenient for you to be with her at that time.

Lilly: No.

Lilly: Because I wanted to be with her at that moment because she and I are friends.

Me: She doesn't think so.

Lilly: Well that was the reason.

Me: Then why did you not wish her a happy easter? Or ask her opinion about the dress? Or literally almost never talk to her unless I am not giving you the attention you want?!

At this time she had texted my best friend about all this, and mentioned something about how this was bound to happen.

Me: And by the way, how was this bound to happen?

Lilly: I didn't wish anyone a happy easter only you and (dude I didn't know).

Me: Well then why did you wish me a easter and not others?

Me: Also you are ignoring my points for your convenience.

Lilly: Because I was talking to you.

Lilly: I am talking to her I even wished her a happy Bday.

Me: No, you just randomly said happy easter while we hadn't talked earlier today.

Me: And wishing someone a happy birthday is such a chore, how good of you to remember that for someone who was there for you for like three years.

Lilly: I meant the dress.

Me: What?

Me: are you seriously throwing a tantrum because I did not tell you you looked good in a dress you had on five fucking years ago?!

Me: That is just fucking petty.

Lilly: Not five years ago.

Lilly: I talked to her.

Me: You said it was five years ago.

Lilly: That was another dress.

Me: Okay?

Me: that's nice for you?

Me: I'm allowed to have my own opinion and if you don't like it then it's not my problem.

Me: Because **you** asked me.

Me: So I gave it.

Me: Then you're upset.

Me: I'm not going to lie about it when you ask my opinion like that, welcome to the real world.

Me: It's not all rose petals and sunshine.

Me: And if you prefer honesty so much then don't get upset when I am being honest.

Lilly: Haha, you are one to talk.

Me: Or lie about being sick in a test week when you can still walk the dog, be online the entire day, or clean your room.

Lilly: You only want the beauty not the beast, but there is no beauty without the beast.

Lilly: I was ill and my parents want me to walk the dog when I am ill so I get some fresh air.

Me: I have put up with all your talk about your problems! All your attention seeking! All your trying to be emo! All you wanting to ask me what's wrong and then not saying it.

Lilly: I am not.

Me: **DO NOT FUCKING TELL ME I ONLY WANTED THE BEAUTY NOT THE BEAST BECAUSE ALL I AM FUCKING NOTICING IS THE BEAST**

Me: And don't use cryptic shit or quotes, use your own words.

Lilly: I talk to you because we are friends and I care about you, I talk to you because your opinion is important to me, I talk to you because I like spending time with you.

Me: It shows how high you value my opinion and friendship when somedays you will randomly be upset with me.

Lilly: No that ain't true.

Me: Or get upset when I say I don't like a dress.

Me: Or always ask someone else after asking me.

Me: Or doing the exact opposite after asking my advice.

Lilly: You and I know it wasn't about that dress.

Lilly: And what do I do that with?

Me: Everything.

Me: And if it isn't, then please elaborate.

Lilly: We both knew it was going to happen anytime soon.

Lilly: The fight.

Me: **WE DID FUCKING NOT**

Me: I've been there for you so much, but fine.

Me: Pretend I wasn't.

Lilly: Remember my notebook.

Lilly: The little one.

Me: Stop saying remember this, remember that.

Me: It's annoying.

Lilly: Nah.

Me: K. Then not.

Lilly: Stop talking behind my back.

Me: I'm talking to you.

Lilly: And behind my back.

Me: Stop acting like a baby throwing a tantrum.

Me: And if you thought we'd have a fight it says more about you then about me.

Lilly: Well it was time, it always is, so yeah, I wasn't really surprised.

Me: Also you're talking behind my back so stop giving points that are crap.

Me: And how is it time?

Me: Seriously, you've had lots of fights with lots if people, maybe it's not their fault.

Me: Maybe, just maybe, the world isn't against you.

Me: Maybe you're making it like that.

Lilly: Excuse me?

Me: You never said we were bound to have a fight, but you did say it to (best friend).

Me: Who, believe it or not, is my best friend.

Lilly: I know she is.

Me: And today I was supposed to celebrate her birthday with her.

Lilly: Just because I wasn't sure I already thought we were going to have a fight.

Me: But instead I'm fighting with you.

Lilly: How should I know? Wasn't invited, wasn't told,

Me: It was family and me.

Lilly: How am I supposed to know if she didn't tell me.

Me: Stop making that about yourself.

Lilly: I just said how am I supposed to know something if someone didn't tell me.

Me: I did tell you I was visiting her.

Me: I just fucking pointed it out don't go whine about it.

Lilly: Just now yes.

Lilly: Yes you told me **today**.

Me: Not just now.

Lilly: Today, whatever.

Lilly: Forget that I have a lot on my mind.

Me: You always have 'a lot on your mind.'

Lilly: It is the truth.

Me: Don't use it as an excuse.

Lilly: It is the truth.

Lilly: But you know what happened last year.

Me: No I don't.

Me: Is this about your grandma dying?

Me: I'm going to take the silence as a yes.

Me: **THAT IS THE STUPIDEST REASON EVER**

Me: **DON'T USE HER FUCKING DEATH AS AN EXCUSE**

Me: That's just disrespectful to her.

Lilly: I never said it was

Me: Then wtf is it.

Me: If you won't tell me, then fine.

Me: But don't plan on me wanting to talk to you if you can't even give me a reason.

Me: You act like you are soooo depressed and sad and need approval.

Me: Well we all do.

Me: You go be a special little snowflake because you won't keep friends this way.

Lilly: I hadn't had any before.

Me: Hadn't had any what? Depressed feelings?

Me: Well here's a little lesson.

Lilly: OP go away.

Me: If you act like you are 'depressed', you'll start to believe it.

Me: And depression isn't just being sad.

Me: By the way you're the one that wanted to leave.

Me: Sorry you can't handle the truth, I'll go away.

Lilly: Like I don't freaking know that!!

Me: Don't come to me next time you have problems.

Lilly: I surely won't.

Me: Depression isn't just about being sad btw.

Lilly: I know that!!!

Me: It's about not having a lot of feelings.

Me: Sure you do.

Lilly: I know that. Yes.

Me: If you are depressed then get some help.

Me: Don't come whining to me when you have problems, get actual fucking help.

Lilly: I? Maybe you should

Me: From a psychologist.

And then she blocked me.

Now was I out of line for some of the things I said? Probably at least a little, but I have some people close to me that deal with it, so to see it misused like that really ticks me off. And if she does have depression then she shouldn't have been expecting me to fix it or help if she never even hints at it.

Even reading all this back gets me annoyed.

After this I ignored her for a long time, throwing away all the notes she wrote me, until one day I was kinda done with it and said I just wanted an apology and I could start forgiving her.

She apologised, and I did indeed forgave her, big mistake, because not even a year later she fucked up again, apologised, and I forgave her again. I'm a push over.

I cannot wait for high school to be over so that I never have to see her again.

**TL;DR;**  Friend gets offended over a five year old dress that I say doesn't fit, and all hell breaks loose.",relationships,It all starts with a five year old dress.
t2_j5j6w,1553780480.0,b6ixgf,t3_b6ixgf,4,"This is going to be a doozy, probably very long, ranty, and disorganized. Sorry for that. 

To start, I met my ex(I'll call him C) online, and our relationship was entirely long distance, so if you think this kind of relationship is less valid than the norm, I don't really want to hear it. Thank you. 

We met when we were 14 and by the end of that year, we were together. No relationship is perfect, and we were obviously very young, so we made a lot of mistakes, but we were generally happy. We worked through mistakes, arguments, etc. and by the time we were 18, things were good. We'd started plans to move in together, from basically opposite ends of the country, knowing it would be tough but determined to make it happen. 

Near the end of 2016, he started to cheat on me. This person was also long distance, but closer, and this is one of the plethora of (inconsistent)reasons he gave me for doing what he did. This went on for about 2 weeks before he told me what was going on. He told me he was cheating(Didn't put it that way, but that's what was happening), but that he was devoted to me and he would tone down his time with this other person. This obviously greatly distressed me, but he seemed to expect me to just accept what he was doing and approve of him continuing to hang out with this person. Of course I didn't approve and told him that this person needed to go. He flatly refused, but I loved him deeply and he insisted nothing would happen, so I relented, which was a grave mistake. 

About a week after telling me, I bought him a gift. He told me that [person] already got him the same gift. I had a bit of a freak out. After being all cryptic and telling him that this situation was draining my will to live, I turned off my phone and basically didn't talk to him for the whole day, spending it with my brother instead.

At the end of the day, I texted him and he said we were done. Looking back, I knew deep down it was coming. Of course everyone says long distance doesn't work, cracks were forming in our plans, etc. I realize I was immature in dealing with this situation, but I still believe he was flatly wrong in what he did. If he'd wanted to pursue another relationship, I think I deserved confirmation before he did that. Either way, this is basically a prologue to what my more current problem is. 

Skip ahead to the beginning of 2018, we'd talked a couple of times throughout 2017, but the pain was very raw for me, and he seemed to be blaming me for things, so I'd decided to focus on other things; school, my brother's upcoming marriage, etc. At the beginning of the year, however, we got in contact. I was in what would turn out to be a temporary but fun relationship, and he was still with the person he'd cheated on me with. I forget who sent the first message, but I think it was me. I wanted to be friends again, and he seemed like he'd been wanting to talk to me too. 

This is fairly relevant context for some of my actions in the rest of the story, C is quite poor. He and his family get by, but he's never had much in the way of spending money. I'm middle class, in and out of part time jobs while going through college, and typically get money as gifts from various family members. Soon after we reconnected, I decided to get him a Christmas/birthday gift, as he'd mentioned that his laptop was failing. So I got him a laptop, I think it was about 300 dollars. Not that much, but I was unemployed at the time, so it was a good portion of the money I had on hand. 

This is fairly unimportant, but this is where I started to see a trend. For a couple of weeks after getting him this gift, we talked all the time and spent lots of time together. I felt like he was really my friend for a while. This didn't last long, and we were soon distant. I didn't mind this so much, as I was busy most of the time and I knew I wasn't any kind of priority for him anymore. Eventually, he opens up to me about how [person] doesn't seem to really care about him and misses the kind of affection and love I gave him. Keep in mind, my relationship ended a little while before, and I definitely still loved C. I took this as the start of us getting back together. He confided in me more than once, and he admitted that he still loved me too. 

After a couple of months, I guess he and [person] had a talk or became closer somehow, because he started to distance himself from me again. I was disappointed, but I didn't get too upset really, knowing he'd prefer not to end another relationship. We stayed distant through the summer, talking occasionally but not really being actual friends. 

Fast forward a bit to about October of 2018. 

My mother had been battling stage 4 breast cancer for almost a year now, and the last effective drug had begun to stop working. I tell C about this and he says that he wants to be there for me throughout this whole thing, and that he wronged me in the past and wants to atone for that. Mom was put on another experimental treatment, but it quickly proved to have little to no effect. She was moved into hospice. I went to C for support a lot during this time, and he helped me a few times, but mostly told me he didn't have time or patience enough to really care about my problems. I'm paraphrasing that, but he was very transparent in how little he could bring himself to care about me. 

I decided to stop asking for his support after a while, and mom died early this year. I was very close to my mother, so I was indeed very sad, but it had been coming for a while and I was glad that her pain had ended, so I rebounded pretty quickly. 

Here's where it really gets bad, and makes me seem like an ignorant child. I got inheritance from my mother. Not a ridiculous amount, but certainly more than I'd ever had before. C's birthday had been recently and I hadn't talked to him at all lately, so I decided that I needed to get him another gift. I spent about 2000 dollars on a few gifts for him. I rationalized this to myself, saying that he'd been there for me in the *really* rough times, even if he wasn't consistent, and that I hadn't gotten him a birthday or Christmas gift last year. I'm the type of person who loved giving gifts, not to imply I'm a very generous person, it's just something I enjoy, and again, I still very much loved C, in spite of everything. So again, repeating the trend from the last gift I'd gotten him, we were very close for a couple of weeks. He told me thank you all the time, hung out with me just about every day, and even said he loved me again, but specified it was in a platonic way. That's fine, I knew our romantic relationship was long gone, and I was having a great time just being friends again, very thankful for his friendship in my rough time. In the back of my mind, I suspected I was being taken advantage of though. 

Keep in mind that C is not any kind of greedy, and is always reluctant to accept gifts from me(Though I guess that could be a front since he knows I'll get him gifts anyway, but I don't think so). 

This brings us to now, he's again distancing himself from me. I feel kind of betrayed, as I thought we were going to be friends for keeps this time. He insists that he cares about me and wants to stay friends, and gets very defensive when I bring any of these feelings of doubt up with him. I also feel sick whenever he mentions his current SO, seeming to forget how their relationship came to be and what that might mean to me. I feel like I really should cut him out of my life and try to completely move on from all of the cheating and everything, but I just can't bring myself to. I love him and I want to be there for him even if he won't stick to being there for me when I need him. 

Not sure what to do. 

**TL;DR**(Very simplified): My ex acts like a friend after I give him gifts, but he's never really there when I need him despite him saying he wanted to be. I know I should leave him behind entirely, but I can't bring myself to do it. 

I really just want advice on any aspect of this huge rambling post, mainly from anyone who's successfully cut someone bad for them out of their lives.

Anyone who's actually willing to read this is an absolute angel. Thank you.

She's told me about her past and how she was abused and scarred from previous relationships and is still a little mentally unstable and depressed. She overthinks a lot and has major trust issues now. Despite knowing all this we still want to try and make things work. I want to be the one to help her heal and make her healthy again so she can move on from her past. Things were going great, but recently, literally right after we finished sexting, she started asking questions about a girl I had sex with in the past and asked if I thought about her. I told her the truth and told her that she crossed my mind while masturbating. I have 0 feelings for the girl in my past and I never did but when I went home over the break my gf was on her period and I guess I was just extremely frustrated I couldn't have sex with her which is no excuse for what I did. She was absolutely devastated and I felt so guilty and disgusted with myself. I texted her and voicemailed her the whole day telling her how sorry I was and that I would do anything to make it up to her. She asked me how I could do that to her knowing her past and knowing how much she trusted me. She said that what I did was repulsive and that she was disgusted with herself for sexting with me. She said she was so close to being healed but now she thinks she's not enough for me and is back to the way she was before or maybe even worse. To make matters worse, this was similar to a situation she was in with her abusive relationship in the past. Even after all this, she told me she forgives me and that we can stay together but I know she still thinks about me and that girl and I don't know how to make it up to her or how to forgive myself for what I did. I feel like I got a second chance that I don't deserve and the guilt of putting salt on her wounds is killing me. I want to go back to the way we were before but the thought of how I hurt her is constantly on my mind. How can I forgive myself for what I did...

I hate myself but I looked at my boyfriends Facebook account and I see he’s in contact with old FWBs and exes. It mostly seems like casual platonic catching up. But one of the women keeps asking him to hang out and come to her place to hang out as friends and chat. And he avoids her and says he thinks she has ulterior motives ( I think she does too), but she denies it. She sent him pictures of her in a bikini, and she’s actively trying to meetup with him all the time at her home. The other lady he’s talking to seems to be a friend that he must have slept with based on the info. He says he will hang out if there’s no sex involved. But I can tell he’s still tempted by her. He tells her that he feels conflicted sometimes because of his “hormones” but he also knows from past encounters that even if his partner never found out about the cheating, cheating makes your partner less attractive to you and he doesn’t want that to happen with me. He also says he thinks Im the right person for him. 

I’m happy he hasn’t cheated. And I’m happy he says he wants to stay committed to me. But I’m insecure that he was even talking to these women or entertaining the notion of meeting up with them as if it was going to be platonic when it seems that’s not what they want. Also, I’m troubled by his reason for staying monogamous. Just so that the sex doesn’t decline ?? What about my feelings, what about the guilt? 

I feel insecure and I’m worried that maybe one day he won’t have the restraint to stay faithful. I mean, my body will change, our sex life will fluctuate. I know what I did was wrong. But am I right to feel this way. Should I bring it up with him or just leave it be and trust him? 

Tl;dr my boyfriend speaks to his ex lovers online. Even though he hasn’t cheated I feel so insecure because he mentions in a message that he feels conflicted when he has the urge to sleep with other women and when thinking about his long term happiness in our relationship. What do I do? 

",relationships,My (30) Boyfriend (39) still occasionally speaks to women that he dated / slept with on social media. One of them is likely trying to get him to sleep with her even though he admits he’s with me. I feel insecure

My partner and I have been together for almost 12 years. First five years went really well, we're an OK couple together for the most part but our relationship has always been unstable. We've been toxic with each other within the last 6 years ever since I caught him cheating. We fight a lot and call each other names. I yell and scowl at him a lot. I'm an irritable and a mean person. I don't know if my PCOS had something to do with my attitude or I'm probably just an asshole. He's cheated on me multiple times, I caught him sexting women on facebook. I know I know, I should've left while I still can.

Fast forward to 2019. We have a 3 year old child. He works and pays for everything and feeds everyone at home. I'm more than thankful that he let me leave my job to take care of our daughter. He's a hard working person, he hardly sleep since his clients demand his help almost all the damn time. I, on the other hand is jobless, I can't hold a job down not even a home-based one because my daughter is too clingy. I take care of our child on my own but we do have a house maid and they pretty much do everything at home and all I have to do is look after her. It means that I don't serve my partner thinking that the maid can do my job for me. I gotta admit, I became a little lazy especially every after breastfeeding. I thought everything is going well. I'm starting to regret being a stay at home mom because not being able to go outside everyday within the last 3 years is driving me insane. We don't even say hi to each other anymore, we talk right away about stuff at home. No hugging, no touching hands. Every time he's here, I sit at the edge of our bed and watch him go around the room getting ready for the day and getting dressed to leave. We haven't had sex since October last year, it's been a while since we've gone out as a family, I don't socialize with other people since I don't have friends, I hardly go out of the house due to my spondylolisthesis and being an overweight. I hate myself. I am self-deprecating, he once called my an anti social. I have a crippling social anxiety due to my looks and bad skin and he kept insisting that people don't give a shit about how I look and I should change my mindset. I get upset quickly and I cry a lot when my daughter is asleep or napping.

A few days ago he decided that wants to break up with me, I don't want the same. He says that I am not the person that he needs. I don't make him happy anymore. I don't even take care of him, and I feel very ashamed of it. I know my faults and shortcomings but I wasn't expecting that he wants to end everything. I'm aware that our relationship has gone real bad and there's nothing I can do to make him love me again. It also doesn't help that I'm extremely clingy and we have a child together. I've considered moving out but I don't have enough money to feed me and my child. I also don't have any relatives that would help me get back at my feet. I have brothers but I know I can't get help from them, that they have no means to help me. I've no parents, no friends. Can't get women's aid of some sort from where I live because I'm pretty sure it's not available. I'm 100% sure I'd end up on the streets if I decide to leave with my child. I've spent roughly 30% of my life with this person and I don't know what to do if our relationship ends. I'm considering taking my life.

t2_blugq30,1553673066.0,b61mbu,t3_b61mbu,112,"My boyfriend (20M) and I (19F) have been together for about two years now. Recently we went on a break because I couldn’t handle the constant arguing and he really needed to grow a little, I couldn’t handle the extra stress while also struggling with school and other issues with friend groups. He agreed to the terms and we both established it would be best for the relationship and separated for a couple weeks. 

When we started talking again after the discussed time period I learned that he followed the girl I had been worrying about our whole relationship on social media. At the very begging out our time together he strongly considered dating this girl but then forgot about her the two years he and I were together. He admitted that the plan was to ask her out during our break but he never worked up the courage. 

I was super hurt by this because we had established there would be no dating during this time but if anything had happened between other people we would work past it together. 

After a long conversation it came out that he thinks she’s hotter than me but he loves me and chooses me. He’s a pretty shy guy so choosing me also seems a lot like settling for me because he doesn’t need to get to know another girl. 

What does this mean for the relationship? Is it even something I should worry about? I’m not the type of person to really notice other guys, is that why this bothers me so much?
 
This guy is one of my first healthy relationships so its new ground for me. Before him there were abusers and cheaters. Overall the relationship wasn’t anything bad. He has mentioned being bored but we live in a town with very little to do and both suffered from minor injuries recently making it hard to go out and do things. I’m just confused where I should go from here or if I should let it go? If it’s nothing to worry about then how do I apologize to him for being crazy? 


Thank you for the help.

My boyfriend of two years wanted to date a girl at the beginning of our relationship and during our break he sought out dating her when we said no dating. He then admitted to her being more attractive than me. ",relationships,Boyfriend (20M) told me (19F) a girl we know is more attractive than me and he wanted to date her.
t2_16v4gpoi,1553693067.0,b64g7w,t3_b64g7w,84,"TLDR at bottom.  I've been dating this girl for a three months now. a couple weeks ago she was drunk and so was I. heres where it gets risky. The guy she cheated on her ex with, she still keeps in contact with him. (not her ex but the guy she cheated with) he hits her up every blue moon. This time was different. She was tilting her phone while texting which I pay no mind too but she kept doing it so I glanced over and heres what I read. 

&amp;#x200B;

Him: hey

her: I don't even know what to say I'm emotional right now.

her: I weirdly thought about you today.

Him: whisky and hugs?

Her: I would but I'm at his

Him: all good keep ya head up.

&amp;#x200B;

So the next day I ask her about him and she says ""he's an old friend who hits me up randomly"" 

fast forward to tonight, she's telling me about herself and says ""yeah I used to hit guys up for emotional support whenever my BF wasn't paying attention to me, but I don't do that anymore"" I said was it with one of the guys you cheated with? she said yes. Turns out it was the guy that was texting her that I night I was with her at 2am. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I asked her about the messages and she lies. She doesn't tell me exactly what they say to each other. I asked her one final time to come clean, she gets her phone out reads the messages and she lied again. and I tell her ""you left the part out where he asked for drinks and hugs, also where you said ""I would but I'm at his""

After I dropped her off at home she said “ I lied because of how jealous you get about me and other guys” which is true I do get jealous and I’m currently in therapy and also seeking a psychiatrist for help and coping mechanism for anxiety. I completely understand she was probably scared of my reaction, I never got physical or yelled at her for my jealousy I’d just get sad and shut down and would want my space. Since then though I’ve been making good progress with combating my issues. 

I’m not sure where to go from here with her now. 

TLDR: GF OF 1 MONTHE LIED TO ME ABOUT A COMVERSATION SHE HAD WITH AN OLD FWB SHE CHEATED WITH OM HER EX. WHEN I COMFORTED HER SHE LIED ABOUT THE CONVERSTAION BECAUSE SHE WAS SCARED OF MY REACTION BECAUSE I GET OVERLY JELOUS.

so, for a bit of backstory, my boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 months. he’s been deployed for 2 months now. 
being military myself, I understand that there is a stereotype within the military about deployed service members coming back home and discovering their s/o has been cheating on them. my boyfriend takes this to heart and is constantly worried that I’m going to betray his trust, even though I’ve never done anything to make him question my loyalty. I would never cheat on him; I’ve been cheated on before and I know how awful that feels. aside from that I just don’t have any interest in sex with casual partners. 

the issue is, he gets upset if I so much as hang out with one of my male friends. I decided to grab some lunch with a buddy from high school in my college’s dining hall one day, and he was still upset about it the next day, saying I should have asked him first. if I even mention having any small interaction with a guy (be it friend or classmate or store employee) he becomes passive aggressive with me and accuses me of cheating on him or going behind his back. in his opinion it’s completely normal for him to not want me to have male friends. 
he has also claimed that my guy friends only want to hang out with me because they want to screw me. that part is kind of hurtful. 

my question for you all is, in your opinion, is it okay for a woman to have platonic friendships with men? essentially, would you feel threatened if your s/o had friends of the opposite sex (or whatever gender they have a preference toward)? how can I make him feel more comfortable with the idea of me having friends of the opposite sex? or if I’m in the wrong, should I just not hang out with guys? 

above everything else I want to make sure he’s happy and feels secure in our relationship while he’s deployed as well as when he’s home.

She is just too busy with her work, and when I come up with some plan for the both of us, she complains and says that I take away her time.
When she is free, she either sleeps or watches a movie. It is as though she is not interested in me anymore.

But I do everything for her, from food to her assignments , everything I can. I take more subjects than her at school and I still have extra time for our relationship. We only go out to malls if she wants something.

We fight almost everyday, and honestly it’s been putting me off. I sometimes doubt this relationship.

Sex is off the table. She just comes up with so many excuses, and when I make the first move to seduce her, she says that I touch her inappropriately and says I don’t respect women. 

When I asked her if she wanted to breakup, she says she loves me and doesn’t wanna breakup.

I'm flying out to California to see him in about 5 days, and today he suddenly told me that his parents want to eat dinner with us a few days out of the week I'll be there.

In addition to having crippling anxiety, I've never really been in a serious enough relationship to where I got to meet my significant other's family, let alone live in their house for a week and share meals together.

Therefore, I only have a vague idea of what they're like, and I'm extremely scared of accidentally saying something that'll end up in them banning me from their house forever.

My cousin on the other hand thinks the complete opposite. If somebody is really your friend they're going to tell you when they think you're wrong and not support your decision to the extent of even cutting you off completely regardless if it affects them directly or not. 

I've been honest with her about going thru the mental and pyschical abuse in the past and has NEVER once felt he wad in the wrong.

So because I actually enjoy hearing people's opinions, and if I'm wrong i can correct myself, what does everybody else think? Or just any general opinion at all would great

She still wants to be in this relationship because she brings up meeting her parents, etc. She used to ask for a lot of attention and want to be with me all the time. Now she doesn't really chase me and doesnt really want my attention anymore.

The next day, the weird things started happening, in the morning, a mutual friend(F17) of ours, told me she needs some distance and time, that made me confused, as we weren't in relationship or anything. It still made me feel really bad, because ever since we met we've been really close to each other. 





Our friend also told me that she already knew that i had feelings for her,i thought maybe that's why she's acting so weird. But the things got even stranger. I didn't text or talk to her for a day, she calls me and acts as if nothing happened. It was the the day i went back to university in another city.






That day one of my best friends calls me and tells mw she feels bad because I've been ignoring her. My reaction then was like, what the fuck, you did this yourself, you wanted it.





In the next few days she's been texting me sometimes, my friend told me today she's been going out with that guy, but has been acting really weird, angry and unusual. He told me she still feels bad for the things between us being  strained, she was afraid of calling me because she thinks after that we won't talk to each other anymore.





Maybe it's because she knows about my feelings towards her, i don't know. But I've never strived for a relationship with her. Yeah that'd be nice, but still i don't want to lose one of my closest friends.

t2_zjmsv,1553746907.0,b6ecbt,t3_b6ecbt,2,"First things first: we met on tinder. 

After talking for like a day, he shows up at my work (I’m a server)! I got off right after he left, and he was still in the parking lot so we just hung out and talked for a while. 

We went in a couple dates, movies and dinner and that stuff when he made a move. I told him I wasn’t comfortable yet, I had some bad experiences in the past and wanted to take things slow. He was so kind and understanding and didn’t pressure me to ask what happened. I also asked if he’s just looking for a FWB or a relationship, and he told me he wants a relationship but doesn’t want to jump into it too soon. I agreed that’s what I wanted. We were just starting a casual dating thing after a little because we aren’t worried about a relationship; if it happens it happens, if it doesn’t that’s ok too. 

It’s been a few months, we started talking in December. We’ve been seeing each other still and talking at least once a day saying good morning or snap chatting occasionally throughout the day. We’re both adults, I’m not worried about what he’s doing or with whom. At least I thought, until I realized I started to like him. 

I was having pretty bad anxiety on a date night a few weeks ago, and wanted to cancel but he promised he would make me feel better. We met at the movies, and went in and sat down at the back. We were holding hands, and then the rollercoaster scene comes on before the movie starts and he puts his arm around me and starts making the chchchchch sounds and putting his other hand up and moving us from side to side like a real ride. I started giggling and had the biggest smile. 

During the movie at random times he would just kiss my forehead, or kiss the back of my hand a bunch when he was holding it. He fell asleep because he had a long day at work and he had already seen the movie, and I just played with his hair. After the movie we just talked for a little and I went home feeling a little better. I realized “oh fuck”... I was starting to fall for him. 

A different day, he drove an hour with his grandmas car because his was broke, just to see me after class and give me a hug... I about cried when I saw him and he hugged me. He literally just wanted to see me, even after I had gone a few weeks without seeing him due to school, work, anxiety and stress and he was so amazing during all of it. 

I realized after talking about that with my friend that I really am starting to like him. I’ve met his sister and his parents when I went over to his house the first time, and I’m nervous to tell him. I know I need to, I think he feels the same way but at the same time I don’t know how to approach him. This is the first real “adult” relationship I’ve had, where we take things slow and not just get into a relationship after a couple of dates. 

We have been intimate, and the sex is amazing and we have great sexual chemistry which is a big thing for me. 

My question is this: should I wait to see if he initiates anything, or should I just go ahead and tell him I need to talk to him and let him know I’m starting to catch feelings and we should have an adult discussion? Any tips or hints or helpful sayings will be appreciated. 

Also, he kept saying he wanted to move out of his parents house before getting into a relationship when we first started our dating... he is getting the keys for his house April 26th, and he wants me to be one of the first few he gives a tour to. 

TL;DR: The guy I have been seeing that I started off casually dating is the sweetest guy and I am starting to fall for him. Sex is great, he’s an amazing guy, and I need some help on how to approach him with talking about furthering our relationship, or how to go about it.

t2_29q6dvxu,1553715324.0,b68my6,t3_b68my6,8,"TL;DR IN THE BOTTOM

Okay.. So I have been dating(ex-bf now) this guy for almost 2 years, he is 19 and I am 18 and now we are in our first year of University. We both have almost the same classes and spend our time together. Well the problem here is that I don't know if I'm right for him. Whenever we talk it somehow gets into an argument. He tells me that I never understand what he's saying and when I do tell him to make me understand he never does and expects me to know everything which results to him getting mad. Also, whenever he tells me his feelings, I acknowledge them but at the same time when I try to express myself to him he tells me that I always talk about myself and that I'm not noticing his feelings which in fact I do, but he believes otherwise. Another thing is that he always tells me I'm lying about things when I'm not. 

One time during the summer when we were on a break another guy dm'ed me but we only talked normally for a day and then I blocked him after because even tho me and my bf were just on a break, i still didn't want to disrespect him. When we got back together later, he told me that what I did was cheating and that I had broken all his trust. Ever since then our relationship has always been rocky. During our break he talked to another girl as well but whenever I bring it up he always dismisses it. 

He always tells me that I have lie to him but he never tells me what I did wrong. I admit, I have lied to him about a few things but I have always told him about it later and none of these lies are harmful, it was just that I broke a promise about hanging out or that I did something stupid like making an account on instagram 2 years before I met him and talked to myself on it (lol im not going to go into detail about this, because this is such a stupid thing).  He tells me that I have to gain his trust because he feels like I broke it when the guy DM’d  me. And I don’t talk to any guys at all and he knows that. I have 0 straight guy friends but he has many friends who are girls and that’s okay.

Also, he always gets jealous when I follow guys on instagram but they are guys that I know but when he does the same its okay all of a sudden. Also, during our relationship when other girls DM’d him and replied back, he never branded that as cheating. He said it was a mistake and moved on but when I did the same, he tells me that what I did was cheat on him. 

Also, he has talked to my mom on the phone one time and disrespected her, which my mom obviously got mad at and didn't approve of our relationship but I still wanted to be with him anyways because I liked him.  Another thing is that he gets mad over the littlest things, whenever I don't look nice or I just look like a hobo lol, he tells me to dress better or look better because he wants his friends and family to have a good impression on me all the time. Like when we are at university, he tells me to always put my hair back because I look better like that and because if his friends see me I will look good in front of them.

I told him that I wanted a break because I couldn’t deal with the emotional stress and that I wanted to better myself first before I can get back into the relationship. I told him that it’s free for him to move on since it wouldn’t be fair if he waits for me. I told him that I still care for him and want to be with him in the future but at this point on I am unable to. He then tells me that I was fake and never truly loved him and wasted 2 years of our lives because of the way I feel. He said that If I truly loved him, we would’ve been together and we could’ve gotten over it together but I don’t agree with that since we’ve tried doing that before and it hadn’t worked. Which is why I thought me being alone for a while would be better instead. So, I had told him we can be friends until I get back to normal and if he doesn’t want that he can move on. To which he didn’t give me a proper reply

Until yesterday. Yesterday, he posted a picture on Instagram with the caption “follow me on this wedding website- my username being John(for example)”. He posted this on his public account with almost 4000 people and not his private account. 
Obviously there were many girls who had commenting back and he even replied to all of them. One of his comments to the girls were “only if you teach me how to smile”. And I thought that what he did was really disrespectful so I blocked him on that account. He then texted me saying that what he posted was a JOKE and he didn’t know SO many girls would comment. He thought only his friend would. He said that he did this to get my attention. And that he has nothing to hide, since it wasn’t a dm but a public post where I could see it all.

I don’t know if I’m crazy or not but he tells me that he loves me and wants to be with me after he did this. I can’t believe it. He said that he gave up all his friends for me and that he has no one to talk to about this because he lost me as his best friend. I never told him to give up his friends for me, I always encouraged him to hang out with them. 

When we were on the phone yesterday, he told me that he will make me regret my choice of not being with him and that he would smear his success in my face in the future. But later on he texted me saying that he was only hurt, which is why he said those things. Which he does a lot, when he’s mad he says the craziest things but always apologizes for it afterwards.

EDIT: he also said that I’m not ready mentally because that’s what I believe and that no one says this type of stuff when their in a middle of a relationship. He’s telling me that how I feel is an excuse and that I just played him.


(TL;DR): I really am unable to understand anything that’s happening to me rn.

t2_49y154w,1553733141.0,b6c51f,t3_b6c51f,4,"BACKGROUND: We have been friends since I moved to this state about 3 years ago and I somewhat have a hard time making new female friends. I’ve always been sort of a tomboy all throughout my life. Perhaps the main reason why it was easy for me to befriend her was because she is the same way. Anyways, we both moved from another state and are currently in long-term relationships. Over time I have found that my best friend’s favorite thing to discuss is her relationship problems. My boyfriend is fairly acquainted with my best friend’s boyfriend before any of us ever dated each other. My boyfriend understands that not too many people, including himself, do not really like him. The guy is pretty narcissistic, selfish, and always shines a negative light in situations most people don’t have any issues with. 

At this point, from what my best friend has told me, her relationship with her boyfriend has already gotten toxic. Now it truly is a wonder for me and to everyone who knows her, why the hell is she still with this guy? It’s like she is diseased with the hope that she can change him and she can finally get this guy to finally treat her how she wants to be treated. One night we were drunk and I truly expressed how I felt about her relationship as she was ranting about it, in a “fed up” type of way. every time she said something he did to her, I said “break up with him”....“break up with him then.”. After that, her complaints reduced about 85%. 

PROBLEM: For the past couple months, I have been planning a road trip out of state with my best friend, boyfriend, and male friend (whom my boyfriend, best friend and I are very close with). My best friend initially did not want her boyfriend at all involved in this trip because he always would go on trips with his friends without her. Last night we were with our boyfriends at a social function and she asks me if her boyfriend can come on the road trip with us, with her boyfriend right next to her!! I honestly do not want this guy to go...thanks to my best friend, I do not respect him at all. I told her there won’t be enough room in my car, which was true...then she answers, “we can take my car!”. then moments later I tell her privately the friend’s place we will be staying at won’t have extra room for a 5th person. Then she responds, “well we can just get our own place....I just feel bad because I never even take more than 5 days off to go on a vacation with him”. I thought in my head....how is that my fucking problem?!

This guy will seriously ruin the trip and now I regret inviting her even though she is my best friend. I don’t know what to do and I really don’t want to lose this friendship. What should I do?

t2_r9sn7,1553786550.0,b6k3v3,t3_b6k3v3,4,"We became really good friends over the last 6 months of living together but she had a boyfriend who lived in a different country so nothing happened, but there was always a spark between us. 

Three weeks ago she broke up with her boyfriend, partly because they found it hard being long distance and partly because of me. 

About a week later, I told her I liked her more than a friend and we kissed when we were both drunk. Two weeks in and now we're dating and having sex.

I think it may of been a mistake because now I get irritated spending time with her and preferred it when we were friends. It might just be because suddenly its like we're a couple living together and skipped the whole dating and girlfriend thing.

I'm not sure what to do now, I don't want to hurt her feelings by telling her I just want to be friends again and I'm worried it wouldn't be the same if we went back. Should I carry on with the relationship and give it another chance? Or maybe I should tell her I just need some space? 

Also, it's unlikely this will be a long term relationship if we did carry on as she is moving out of the country in 3 months.

I'm  getting married in 6 months to a woman who loves to me to death, and I  love her the same.  Been together five years and otherwise have a great relationship bar this huge issue for me.

&amp;#x200B;

When  we first met I had ended an engagement that was a long distance  relationship that had been falling apart for some time.  She was an  acquaintance of mine at the time and remembers me mentioning the breakup  and how it had made me sad, mostly because I felt like I had wasted  both of our time not living up to my own expectations of myself.

&amp;#x200B;

She  remembered this and really held it against me as our relationship  progressed, feeling like I was the needy type that was always willing to  settle, and that maybe I was doing the same with her.  This girl is  also far more attractive than the previous ex and I feel that messed  with her ego to see herself as an equal in my eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

Over  the relationship if anything reminded her of my ex she would flip on  me, whether it took days or weeks, it would come out in a very unhealthy  way.  Days of fighting, screaming at me and showing me pictures  demanding I say I was an idiot and should be ashamed.  Multiple fights  happened where she would just shut off emotionally entirely after  flipping out and these fights never really resolved.   She would just  lose energy, apologize and we would move on with me burying all of the  frustration and anger under the carpet.  Only in the last 12 months or  so has this stopped.  I've been taking this shit for years for the sake  of the relationship and completely ignoring my own issues with her.

&amp;#x200B;

When  she was young she was one of those hot, but insecure girls with major  daddy issues that liked to be the loud obnoxious girl that would do  anything for attention.  When we first met she was very up front about  not wanting a serious relationship and even bragged about orgies,  threesomes, drug-fueled parties, using men for money and gifts and proud  of how often she savagely cheated on her ex.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless  to say this was the sum of all my biggest fears to find out about  someone later on down the road, but hey, I got it all right up front.   Oddly, because of this I approached the relationship without hesitation  of being myself, blunt and pushed this aside as this was now obviously a  rebound situation anyways.   Due to my fearless approach of  not-giving-a-fuck the chemistry in the relationship actually ended up  working out.

&amp;#x200B;

As  the relationship got more serious her issues with my past became a huge  problem and I was never able to deal with how I felt about hers other  than a few outbursts that she probably thought were just retaliatory.   I've mentioned it as an issue before but I can't get specific enough  about the shit that actually crosses my mind and how often it happens.

&amp;#x200B;

She  knows it is an issue and has brought it up recently, acknowledging how  much of a shitty person she at times was before me, how lost and low  self-esteem she was and why she felt ashamed at all of that.   This was  all unprompted by me.

&amp;#x200B;

I  don't have as much an issue with the sexcapades as much as an issue I  have with the flaws in her personality that led her down that path.  Now  before anyone goes on a rant about me being insecure and slut-shaming  it isn't that.   I've had my own somewhat wild sexual past, including  multiple partners at once, am a good looking, tall dude and am well  endowed.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm  not worried she had more fun than me, or that maybe her ex and her had  some swinging fun.  What I picture is that in a social situation she  gets insecure and compensates wayyyyy too hard, wanting to dominate,  showoff and willing to do wild shit and create a situation like that  where none existed.

&amp;#x200B;

This  to me is a risk if she is traveling for work, finds herself drinking  with male coworkers and in the past has had very shitty boundaries and  obviously this is part of her sexual appetite.  Even when we were first  together two different times she suggested threesomes with no discussion  with me prior.

&amp;#x200B;

Also  of mention, prior to me she only dated and enjoyed fucking men of a  race different than me, and on occasions made this preference very  clear.  Her mother is racist and likely why a serious relationship in  that path would never work, making me feel like there are guys you fuck,  and guys you marry, and I'm just one to be settled with.

&amp;#x200B;

Because  of all of this I have a hard time not comparing myself to the wild shit  she likely misses.  It makes it hard to initiate regular sex without  feeling fucking silly or pretending that fucking 2-3 times a week at the  exact same time, same day, same way is what she wants.

&amp;#x200B;

This  has me overthinking shit, I get frustrated, resentful of her past,  resentful of how she has treated me with mine and I just keep this all  to myself.   Even when she brought it up I said nothing, just nodded my  head and let her talk.  I need to get this out because I am getting  panic attacks.  

&amp;#x200B;

I love this girl, I want to be with her, I just need to  be able to trust her, the changes she has made over the last 5 years and  feel like I can tell her this without breaking up and address how I  feel without feeling weak or exposed.  I also want us to be more sexually expressive without the fear of triggering the other's fears.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is how can better accept her when she has had trouble accepting me, for something much less controversial?  How can I set this resentment aside of being unfairly shamed and not look at her and feel that way about her now?   I hate looking at something I like about her and feeling that at some point it was made very cheap and impulsively so by her.  I hate having to fight the idea that my supposed queen was happily remembered by many others as something much cheaper, easy, saw her when she was feeling worthless, exposed (specific to her scenario and what was going on in her life at the time).

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Getting married soon, fiancee shamed me for years over my ex being ugly.  I now have repressed all of my own insecurities about her wild past that she happily bragged about but now acts ashamed of now that she gets the scope of the impact it has had on our relationship.

I have my own home with her brother, and all three of our bedrooms and our only bathroom is upstairs. The only reason anyone has to be upstairs is to go to the toilet, or possibly to my daughter's room if their kid is playing there too. 

I've noticed whenever my SIL comes over, she just walks on through to our room, which I kinda feel like is an invasion of privacy. All the clean laundry comes to our room, and if we have visitors we tuck away a few things in our room so it's invariably the messiest room in the house and the one we least want people in. But no matter what she's always in there, and seemingly for no reason at all. It's usually to 'see my paint colour' (it hasn't been painted in over a year) or 'see the cat' or 'look out the front window'.

The worst was today - I came home from work early as I'm feeling ill. I knew she was coming over with her kids and my partner kindly said I could stay in bed and not worry about coming down to be sociable etc, especially with the kids over it's a lot when you have a headache. He said he just wasn't gonna mention I was home at all because the kids would come try and chat and play if they knew I was here.

So I'm listening to them play in the next room and SIL comes up to check on them and sees they are all fine. THEN SHE OPENS MY BEDROOM DOOR. I've stuck my head under the covers and she hovers then closes it again. Wtf?? Why is she always opening my bedroom door like what is she expecting to see? 

I just feel like because we're all adults it's an unspoken boundary, you don't just hit up someone's bedroom without having an invite to come see or a legit reason. 

Am I weird for thinking this is irritating and not being able to make any sense out of it? Also I know that everyone is going to suggest I just talk to her about it but how awkward is that? 'Yo I know you're in you're 30s now but please stay out of my room?'.

She would say how she felt so happy and well when she was with me, but would get sad and depressed sometimes when alone, which is why she thought she had to learn to be on her own. We are still on messaging terms as friends, but agreed to give it some time before we see each other.

On one hand I want to ""wait for her"" in a sense, give it some time (and take some time for myself too, I also haven't been single for long going on year now) and then talk about it and check in with each other in a couple months, see how we both feel then. Another part of me feels like I should just write it of as a lost relationship and move on, but I did see a future with this girl and I feel like I would be risking that possibility by not giving it a chance at least.

What has been your experience with situations like this? Is it healthy to hold off for a bit and see what happens while focusing on myself, or should I just forget about her and stop contact? What's your opinion reddit?

       So my bf(20m) and I (21f) have been together roughly  9 months and we are trying to work through a lot of issues and I'm utterly stumped.

    Well the last few weeks I haven't exactly been the sweetest gf in the world. I mean I've been telling him over and over that I'd like him to help me more with house work and budgeting but all I get is a head nod and ""I'll try better."" Well I haven't gotten off his case and I've border line begged and nagged at him. Also we haven't been having sex like we used to. We're trying to work though all this and its to the point our relationship almost came to an end. 
    He finally sat me down and explained how he's tired of me b*tching at him when he does anything that makes him happy. For example he recently put new speakers and subs in his car because he loves bass and all I asked was that he not make the car rattle when I'm in it. Well a week ago I said he was being inconsiderate because I could hear his radio from our second story apartment,and he was 3 blocks away. I'd like to add that he comes home at 7am in the morning 5 days a week. But he says ""The bass helps me calm down and feel better after work."" Well we already have issues with our downstairs neighbors, and I'd like to not make it worse.
    Any way while he was telling me he was tired of me nagging he went on about how many times he's tried to compromise me and the only examples I got from him was the speaker, and how he doesn't go out to see his parents anymore because he doesn't want me to feel bad about my relationship with my own parents,and he knows I'm not keen on going out there every weekend. Which I said that he can visit his parents anytime and that I wouldn't tell him no and he said ""But I don't want to go without you."" So I don't stop him he's the one who has told me for 9 months that his mom's strictness makes him not want to visit.
    Ugh I'm just frustrated with it all. Like yeah I'm tired of nagging, but I feel like he's trying to make me feel guilty for me wanting him to stop acting like a child.  Like I can go on and on about he gets defensive if I call out his crappy partnership.

TLDR: Boyfriend says I nag at him too much and wants me to be a little nicer, claims I nag at everything that makes him happy. I'm just tired of coddling his feelings. I feel more like his mom than a partner.

She doesn't have any bad blood when it comes to me and she always try to help us patch things whenever we fight. She treats me like her child and I think she loves me as I am. I also do love her and treasure her as my second mom. I think the only thing I don't like about her is her vices like alcohol and cigarettes but maybe if we already have a child she will stop her cigarettes because it would be bad for everyone's health especially hers.

But somehow I can't help but think that living in the same roof would be a problem in the future because I feel like if I would get married, I would want to be the master of the household. For example I want to change the color of the house, I want to be able to change it the way I like it, without anyone telling me what to do. I want to be able to leave the dishes if I feel tired and not feel guilty about it. I want to be able to raise my kids with my husband and I's ways only. I want to be able to do household chores whenever I want to and not just because I'm pressured that my mother in law would be disappointed on how I run the household. I want to be the one who will serve my husband and my kids and do it my way.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that my boyfriend and his mother's relationship is very tight. He loves her so much. He gets crazy when she's sick, he follows what she says, he will never leave her (she's a single parent) and to my boyfriend's eyes she is the only person that has never done him wrong and loves him unconditionally, he always brags about how his mother is the best in the world and that she's very good in taking care of him. in short she is literally his bestfriend and vice versa. I understand that because I am like that to my mom as well, but I can leave her when I get married because she has my dad. My bf's mom doesn't have anyone who can look after her.

&amp;#x200B;

Now he's been asking me and giving me clues that he wants to settle down already, but it is clear that we 3 will live in the same house. I kinda feel okay about it but I'm torn, because really my idea of marriage is starting with just the two of you in the house and eventually having kids but not this setup of having a parent in the house. What should I do? I love my boyfriend but there's a gutfeel in me that something bad will happen if the 3 of us will live in the same house because I can see that they are overprotective of each other which could lead to trouble and I don't want to be the third wheel in my own marriage?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : My boyfriend is a mama's boy and he will never leave her, meaning the 3 of us will live in the same roof in the future. I know that it's coming soon because he told me, and I also told him that yeah I think it's time. But there's a part in me that kinda doesn't want the idea of living with any parent in the house. No matter if it's his parent or mine, I still want just the two of us in the house? What should I do?",relationships,Am I (25/f) making the wrong decision of marrying my boyfriend (25/m) when I know that he is a mama's boy and the three of us will be in the same roof.

She’s said there has been issues that she said I was being irrational about and not seeing her point of view. I’ve been wanting to spend more and more time with her, time she didn’t have. Nothing would ever be enough. However, I’m not sure if this specific issue has a solution. I’d like to point out that I took this girls virginity, and I’m very much invested in the relationship. With that being said, I’m also adapting to the idea that she is her own separate person and the world wouldn’t end if we broke up. 

Anyway, the issue is her sorority social events. Specifically the fact that she has a mixer every Friday and then she doesn’t want to go to any other parties. It’s annoying to not be able to go to parties with her because she’s not a party girl. She said Ive made her guilty in the past because I tell her how I have nothing to do while she’s gone and I just sit in silence and wait for her to be done, that I miss her etc. You need girls to get into parties here, and it feels weird for me going with a group of girls while I have a girlfriend. Then I see all her sisters at these parties and I feel like I’m being watched. Im never drunk with my girlfriend, and I guess I’m left wondering what it is that she does at these mixers.

My dad is a serial cheater and compulsive liar. It’s normally something that’s known but we don’t talk about. Unfortunately, my dad decided to be much more open about his adultery while I was visiting him with my boyfriend a couple days ago. He began telling us a story of how my stepmom (43f) caught him redhanded while he was supposed to be working. He also told us about times that he’s slipped up with text conversations/phone calls. He kept going on about not being a good cheater and how needed to stop. He said he goes weeks where he does “good”, then there’s a slip in the routine. It was embarrassing and uncomfortable to sit through.

My dad and stepmom have been together for about 10ish years. I can’t help but think of the emotional abuse this woman endured. nevermind the physical and mental abuse she endured during her pervious marriage.  I think back to my mom, everything he put through when I was younger. My parents split when I was 9 for the same reasons. I can’t help but have some sort of resentment towards my dad for being a huge part in why my mom self esteem plummeted so bad she’s continuing a relationship with my abuser (story for another time) 

I’ve asked my dad why not leave? He’s all about being frugal and saving money, he could even look at it as a financial gain. They have no children together, everything they have he’s paid for. i’m honestly surprised i’m my dads only child. He’s even known around our hometown. 

I want to sit him down and try to at least reason with him a little bit. I feel wrong, like I’m condoning the behavior. I need him to recognize the emotional trauma he’s inflicted on the women in his life. I need him to recognize that he has a problem and do something about it. I love my dad, he’s been great and stepped up when my mom completely failed me but I just... i’m conflicted and hurt. i’m not sure what to do or is there anything i can do?

Mobile, formatting bad, yknow the deal.

My ex and I have gotten together near the beginning of May last year, and before that we've been friends for roughly three years or so, things are great for a while, until high school happened. When we got our schedules I had no classes with her and didn't even have the same lunch shift as her. We tried to squeeze in time in the mornings and the few minutes going from our locker to the bus ramp. She also recently had to be working during the weekends to not live on the street because she grew up with a deadbeat dad, terrible sister, broke home stuff. That took up a majority of her weekends, and when she wasn't working she was doing chores or homework, so she never had any time to maintain a relationship.

 This went on from the beginning of winter break to roughly a week ago, a cycle of wanting to hang out, never hanging out, thinking I did something wrong because anxiety exists, and being reassured by her that I did nothing wrong. On Monday, she decided to break things off to figure out life, and you can't force a relationship so I agreed, and I feel like such an asshole for doing this, tried to still make some reconnection after considering that she just can't deal with that stuff right now, and yesterday she cut communication between us outside of school. This meant that we can't really see each other at all if she chooses not to. 

One of the people who I trust most in this world, I couldn't even see their face. It's just been picking me apart and usually I always go to worst case scenario, but now that there's a chance I could never see her again, my brain want to be optimistic, and hold on to the memories we shared. I still trust her, and if she says we both needed this, we both needed it. I'm holding on to that bit of hope, and I don't wanna let go until we can talk again, she means too much to me. My question is what can I do to fill the time? She probably wants to cut it for a month or so, and I need something to fill this void.

I'm not sure if I am being to sensitive, but we have been butting heads a lot, as he has been upsetting me very frequently the past couple months. This past week has been a doosie. 


I was upset because he lied to me about not smoking- and I found out he did because his hoodie smelled. 


-I was upset with him for lying and breaking a promise- he proceeded to kiss my butt, but he would not acknowledge his lying so as he realized I wasnt lightening up he started making me feel guilty, and calling me a brat.


-I was repairing some rust on my truck which I was really excited about and he smugly told me I wasnt using my drill correctly. I usually do my own handywork myself and whenever I am excited about something I feel like he always finds a way to nit pick me. 


- my birthday is today, and he is doing some law enforcement interviews so he is unable to spend it with me so I made plans for a Saturday celebration, and he was supposed to help me put the gas tank back into my truck on Saturday before we all go to bfast and see a movie.. but he told me he has an appointment at a jujitsu gym (1 hour away from me) early in the morning, he admitted he forgot I was celebrating, and then proceeded to tell me that it's not a big deal hes entitled to a couple hours on the weekend. which he only said because I told him that i had errands to do a couple weekends ago and he got upset. 



He woke up cranky today. he spent the night so he could leave his dogs at my house because he'll be interviewing all day, and he said hed make me birthday breakfast but he woke up too late, but wakes up early every other day to go to the gym. I just feel like I'm not his priority anymore. Or he doesnt have to treat me with the same sweetness he once did. his motorcycle is in my garage, anytime he needs me I'm there, he has his truck bed in my garage, I watch his dogs, I try to be the most caring I can be but he upsets me and discredits my feelings by saying I'm a princess or a brat and I feel less comfortable sharing things with him now. I just dont feel as special as he once made me feel. We talk through things a lot but only because we've been arguing a lot. I'm not sure if these are red flags I'm ignoring or we're just suffering through a rough patch.

So last year, a guy moved to our school. He immediately caught the attention of everyone, because of his height and pretty attractive face. I wasn't totally phased by him, but rumours started that he was attracted to me. We started talking, and I dodged him for pretty much 7 months until I finally agreed to date him. 

This was my second relationship, and I was known to be someone quite picky. My first relationship lasted almost 2 years, (yes, even though I was young) and that ended badly. So it was really hard for me to move on considering he was also kind of my bestfriend. So me accepting this second guy in my life was a big deal. Bear in mind my country is quite conservative so dating among is common but not too common, yaknow? There's no touching or kissing invovled or any of the sort lol. 


Anyway, it was pretty nice at the start, we went out and it was one of the best days I had in a while. I actually have depression, (taking meds for it) so having someone who could make me feel at ease is really something.


Long story short, we broke up around November. He broke up with me. We both had issues, but he was really harsh with it. Even his friends were mad at him for dumping me the way he did. It's also because everyone knew I don't say yes easily. And wow, was I heartbroken. Everyone kinda knew how miserable I was, but my close friends knew how sad I was every single day. We were even smack in the middle of exams at the time.


This year, my close friend started to date him in around Last February. The thing is, when we broke up, she was one of the people who comforted me. We go to a boarding school, and she was my roommate last year. So she witnessed me getting together with this guy, perhaps some fights, the gifts he got me, she would know. And she was there when we broke up too. She always said me and him were cute together, and got excited when she saw photos of us. When we broke up, she told me he was trash, and he didnt deserve me. And she said he'll make him get what he deserved. At this time she was dating a guy who she had been with longer than me and this dude, but they broke up due to family problems in around January. She really liked this guy. Love even.


But now they're dating.
I feel really messed up. She's my classmate this year, and I used to sit behind her. Since this incident, I switched placed and we don't talk. The ended friendship hurts more. But in general, both of this just hurts. Both of them actually have been known to be somewhat of players, but I guess it's cause I trusted them which is why it hurts so much.


I don't know what to do or what to feel. I just need some opinions and help on what to do, what to not do, and what or what not to feel. Thank you for reading.

another board:

[https://i.imgur.com/HVyQx96.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/HVyQx96.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

**Products:**

Maple Plywood

Minwax pre-stain (I had heard that it maple can be blotchy)

Sherwin Williams BAC Wiping stain - a heavy solvent-based pigment stain  (I went in with the stain they used on our maple cabinets and asked for more... this is what they providided)

&amp;#x200B;

**Process:**

Sanded to 220

Applied pre-stain using a sponge brush, let sit for \~5 minutes while applying to all boards, wiped clean (was basically dry anyway) , let to sit for \~10 minutes (longer for later boards, due to application time)

Applied stain generously with paper towel quickly and as evenly as I could, wiped off vigorously (with clean, dry paper towels) basically as soon as I was done appling...  I'd say it set on the board about 1 minute (I was told this was how long the cabinet maker had it sit).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished this about 30 minutes ago (the penultimate step in a 2+ month long build) and it looks entirely like ass.   Is there a way to fix (either before anything 'dries'/cures) or later?

&amp;#x200B;

My test board did not exhibit this behavior as objectionably (it did slightly, but this is a REALLY dark stain on a really bloch-prone wood... so I was okay with what I got).  However, I did the test board while it was horizontal and I did these while they were vertical... vertical application was MUCH more hectic.  Other than that, the process what identical.  

&amp;#x200B;

(I don't mind the round 'slpotch' - that sucks, but I expect that is due to the plywood, itself)

&amp;#x200B;

Help?

We just returned from vacation, and the house we rented had some interesting deck furniture.  It was similar to Adirondack furniture, but the support members were 1x2s left to right, supported by jigsaw cut 2x4s on the sides.  Pictures are attached.

This stuff was both comfortable and simple.  I think I could built this easily.  But I would love to find some guidance, especially on the side members.  Templates?

Thanks in advance!!!
